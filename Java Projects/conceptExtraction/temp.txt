Concept = LS11
Keyword = [Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,7,0,0,75.280,12,14,signalprocessing,the idea is that what we wanted to do was exploit the properties of linearity and time invariance for linear time invariant systems , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,0,0,86.330,5,6,signalprocessing,so in the case of linear time invariant systems the basic idea was to consider decomposing the input as a linear combination of basic inputs , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,0,0,102.730,12,13,signalprocessing,and then because of linearity the output could be expressed as a linear combination of corresponding outputs where psi sub i is the output due to phi sub i , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,119.610,18,19,signalprocessing,so basically what we attempted to do was decompose the input and then reconstruct the output through a linear combination of the outputs to those basic inputs , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,21,0,0,246.170,9,10,signalprocessing,and the notion of decomposing a signal as a linear combination of these complex exponentials is what first the fourier series representation and then later the fourier transform representation corresponded to , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,22,0,0,262.680,28,29,signalprocessing,and finally to remind you of one additional point the fact is that because of the eigenfunction property the response once we have decomposed the input as a linear combination of complex exponentials the response to that linear combination is straightforward to compute once we know the frequency response because of the eigenfunction property , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,42,0,0,506.150,21,22,signalprocessing,now again just as we did in continuous time we can consider attempting to build our periodic signal out of a linear combination of these , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,57,0,0,658.060,14,15,signalprocessing,and so in fact if we can build x of n out of this linear combination then we better be able to do it as k varies from zero up to n minus one , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,150,0,0,1566.140,34,35,signalprocessing,and recall also that this was essentially the trick that we used in continuous time to allow us to develop or utilize the fourier series to provide a representation of aperiodic signals as a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,12,0,0,122.890,22,23,signalprocessing,and i draw your attention again to the basic point that the synthesis equation essentially corresponds to decomposing the sequence as a linear combination of complex exponentials with amplitudes that are in effect proportional to the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,48,0,0,516.860,14,15,signalprocessing,and the linearity property says simply that the fourier transform of a sum or linear combination is the same linear combination of the fourier transforms , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,71,0,0,783.330,19,20,signalprocessing,specifically the argument was that the fourier transform of a sequence or signal corresponds to decomposing it into a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,74,0,0,805.990,9,10,signalprocessing,if we think of pushing through the system that linear combination then each of those complex exponentials gets the amplitude modified or multiplied by the fourier transform of by the frequency response which we saw is the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,76,0,0,841.470,22,23,signalprocessing,and the fourier transform of the output in effect is an expression expressing the summation or integration of the output as a linear combination of all of these exponentials with the appropriate complex amplitudes , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,79,0,0,900.640,12,13,signalprocessing,kind of the idea that if we decompose the input as a linear combination of complex exponentials we can separately attenuate or amplify each of those components , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,259,0,0,2757.240,15,16,signalprocessing,in the continuous time fourier series we have a periodic time function expanded as a linear combination of harmonically related complex exponentials , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,265,0,0,2831.830,22,23,signalprocessing,and we now have a continuous time function which is no longer periodic this was for the aperiodic case represented as a linear combination of infinitesimally close in frequency complex exponentials with complex amplitudes given by x of omega d omega divided by two pi , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,245,0,0,2166.910,20,21,signalprocessing,so for example as i've stressed previously a recursive difference equation has the general form that i indicate here a linear combination of weighted outputs on the left hand side and linear combination of weighted inputs on the right hand side , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,30,0,0,348.790,13,14,signalprocessing,and finally then in the time domain the reconstructed signal is simply a linear combination of shifted versions of the impulse response with amplitudes which are the sample values , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,135.380,13,14,signalprocessing,we developed the fourier transform by considering the idea of representing signals as linear combinations of basic signals , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,14,0,0,158.800,22,23,signalprocessing,and in what we had referred to as the synthesis equation the synthesis equation corresponded to in effect a decomposition as a linear combination a decomposition of x of t as a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,100,0,0,995.730,10,11,signalprocessing,and which now builds x of t out of a linear combination of not necessarily functions of the form e to the j omega t but in terms of functions or basic signals which are more general exponentials e to the st , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,12,0,0,159.200,24,25,signalprocessing,took advantage of in our discussion last time was the linearly the linearity property which says in essence that the laplace transform of the linear combination of two time functions is the same linear combination of the associated laplace transforms , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,84.380,21,22,signalprocessing,now just as in continuous time in discrete time the fourier transform corresponded to a representation of a sequence as a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,16,0,0,207.570,20,21,signalprocessing,in particular there is as with continuous time a linearity property that tells us that the z transform of a linear combination of sequences is the same linear combination of the z transforms a shifting property that indicates that the z transform of x of n shifted is the z transform of x of n multiplied by a factor z to the minus n zero , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,89,0,0,977.860,7,9,signalprocessing,and as the lecture proceeds the specific properties that i want to get to are properties of linearity and time invariance , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,302,0,0,3000.790,25,27,signalprocessing,and what it says is that if we have some inputs with associated outputs let's say x one t and x two t then a system is linear if it has the property that the output to a linear combination of those inputs is the same linear combination of the associated outputs , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,303,0,0,3027.250,16,17,signalprocessing,and so that's what i've indicated here that if we now put into the system a linear combination of those inputs then for linearity we require that the output is the same linear combination , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,305,0,0,3047.110,10,12,signalprocessing,and you can show from this definition that if a system is linear with two inputs then it's linear in terms of an arbitrary number of inputs , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,318,0,0,3149.550,6,8,signalprocessing,what we'll see is that the properties of linearity and time invariance in particular become central and important properties , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,12,0,0,151.540,53,54,signalprocessing,linearity was a property related to the fact that if we have a set of outputs associated with a given set of inputs as i've indicated here with the inputs as phi k and the outputs psi k then the property of linearity states that if we have an input which is a linear combination of those inputs then the output is a linear combination of the associated outputs , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,13,0,0,186.250,2,3,signalprocessing,so that linear combination of inputs generates for a linear system an output which is a linear combination of the associated outputs , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,14,0,0,199.600,9,11,signalprocessing,now the question is how can we exploit the properties of linearity and time invariance , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,22,0,0,264.890,14,15,signalprocessing,one class is the set of delayed impulses namely decomposing a signal into a linear combination of these , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,24,0,0,285.840,11,12,signalprocessing,the second is a decomposition of inputs into complex exponentials a linear combination of complex exponentials and that leads to a representation of signals and systems through what we'll refer to as fourier analysis , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,27,0,0,322.520,25,26,signalprocessing,so let's begin with a discussion of discrete time signals and in particular the issue of how discrete time signals can be decomposed as a linear combination of delayed impulses , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,35,0,0,439.950,10,11,signalprocessing,the strategy is to decompose an arbitrary sequence into a linear combination of weighted delayed impulses , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,38,0,0,461.370,13,14,signalprocessing,it's useful because we now have a decomposition of the sequence as a linear combination of basic sequences namely the delayed impulses , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,39,0,0,473.080,7,8,signalprocessing,and if we are talking about a linear system the response to that linear combination is a linear combination of the responses , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,41,0,0,520.169,3,4,signalprocessing,so for a linear system we have this representation , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,50,0,0,622.040,15,16,signalprocessing,we of course have taken the sequence x n we have decomposed it as a linear combination of these weighted delayed impulses , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,52,0,0,642.810,55,56,signalprocessing,if this impulse for example generates a response which is x zero h n where h n is the response to a unit impulse at n zero and the second one generates a delayed weighted response and the third one similarly and we generate these individual responses these are all added together and it's that linear combination that forms the final output , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,75,0,0,865.800,4,5,signalprocessing,when we have that linear combination then we're saying that x t can be represented by a sum as i indicate here which i can then write more generally in this form just indicating that this is an infinite sum , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,81,0,0,928.300,24,25,signalprocessing,so what we have now is an integral that tells us that tells us how x t can be described as a sum or linear combination involving impulses , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,86,0,0,989.240,8,9,signalprocessing,so by describing a time function as a linear combination of weighted delayed impulses as in effect we've done through this summation that corresponds to a decomposition in terms of impulses we can now exploit linearity specifically recognizing that the output of a linear system is the sum of the responses to these individual inputs , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,87,0,0,1022.120,33,34,signalprocessing,so with h kdelta t corresponding to the response to delta delta t kdelta and the rest of this stuff the x kdelta and this little delta are basically scale factors for a linear system then if the input is expressed in this form the output is expressed in this form and again taking the limit as delta goes to zero by definition this corresponds to an integral , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,99,0,0,1195.240,9,11,signalprocessing,what we've managed to accomplish is to exploit the properties of linearity and time invariance so that the system could be represented in terms only of its response to an impulse at time zero , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,104,0,0,1277.060,31,32,signalprocessing,and correspondingly in the continuous time case we have the convolution integral which here is the sifting integral as we talked about representing x t in terms of itself as a linear combination of delayed impulses , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,160,0,0,1496.670,34,35,signalprocessing,and before i do what i'd like to do is introduce a peripheral result that we'll then use when we talked about causality namely what's referred to as the zero input response of a linear system , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,161,0,0,1514.820,15,16,signalprocessing,the basic result which is a very interesting and useful one is that for a linear system and in fact it's whether it's time invariant or not that this applies if you put nothing into it you get nothing out of it , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,166,0,0,1578.780,18,19,signalprocessing,but in fact we can show that property relatively easily by simply using the fact that for a linear system what we know is that if we have an input x t with an output y t then if we scale the input then the output scales accordingly , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,182,0,0,1714.030,11,12,signalprocessing,and now so let's look at what that means for a linear system , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,183,0,0,1719.400,2,3,signalprocessing,for a linear system what that corresponds to or could be translated to is a statement that says that if x t is zero for t less than t zero then y t must be zero for t less than t zero also , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,185,0,0,1747.790,2,3,signalprocessing,for a linear system to be causal it must have the property sometimes referred to as initial rest meaning it doesn't respond until there's some input that happens , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,191,0,0,1810.660,5,6,signalprocessing,so this basic result for linear systems is essentially a consequence of the statement that for a linear system zero in gives us zero out , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,199,0,0,1913.610,9,10,signalprocessing,and what we saw before is that for any linear system causality requires that if the input is zero up until some time the output must be zero up until the same time , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,13,0,0,174.270,7,8,signalprocessing,and what it consists of is a linear combination of derivatives of the system output y t equal to a linear combination of derivatives of the system input x t , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,16,0,0,198.670,5,6,signalprocessing,and it's referred to as linear because it corresponds to a linear combination of these derivatives not because it corresponds to a linear system , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,17,0,0,212.620,21,22,signalprocessing,and in fact as we'll see or as i'll indicate this equation may or may not in fact correspond to a linear system , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,19,0,0,230.710,6,7,signalprocessing,and that corresponds to again a linear combination of delayed versions of the output equal to a linear combination of delayed versions of the input , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,43,0,0,515.130,24,25,signalprocessing,now depending on how the auxiliary information is stated or what auxiliary information is available the system may or may not correspond to a linear system and may or may not correspond to a linear time invariant system , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,44,0,0,531.880,9,10,signalprocessing,one essential condition for it to correspond to a linear system is that the initial conditions must be zero , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,45,0,0,541.110,23,24,signalprocessing,and one can see the reason for that if we refer back to the previous lecture in which we saw that for a linear system if we put zero in we get zero out , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,97,0,0,1060.820,3,4,signalprocessing,and again a linear combination this time of delayed versions of the output equal to a linear combination of delayed versions of the input , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,101,0,0,1116.640,10,11,signalprocessing,the homogeneous solution again is of the form of a linear combination of exponentials , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,108,0,0,1174.310,11,12,signalprocessing,and so finally the form for the homogeneous solution is a linear combination of capital n exponentials where capital n is the order of the equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,187,0,0,1986.650,27,28,signalprocessing,so what we've said is that we can calculate the output by having previous values of the input previous values of the output and forming the appropriate linear combination , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,230,0,0,2399.480,13,14,signalprocessing,so to form the output in the block diagram terms we form a linear combination of the input a scaled integral of the input and a scaled integral of the output all of that added together , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,267,0,0,2721.970,22,24,signalprocessing,how do we specify the appropriate initial conditions to ensure how do we specify the appropriate initial conditions to ensure that the system is linear and time invariant , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,5,0,0,67.850,35,36,signalprocessing,the idea was to exploit the notion of linearity by decomposing the input into a sum of basic inputs and then using linearity to tell us that the output can be represented as the corresponding linear combination of the associated outputs , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,85.880,6,8,signalprocessing,so if we have a linear system either continuous time or discrete time for example with continuous time if the input is decomposed as a linear combination of basic inputs with each of these basic inputs generating an associated output and if the system is linear then the output of the system is the same linear combination of the associated outputs , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,14,0,0,195.580,5,6,signalprocessing,decomposing the input into a linear combination of these , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,15,0,0,199.100,5,6,signalprocessing,the output into the corresponding linear combination of these then led to the convolution sum in the discrete time case , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,19,0,0,252.230,23,24,signalprocessing,so in a general sense in the continuous time case we'll be thinking in terms of a decomposition of our signals as a linear combination of complex exponentials continuous time or in the discrete time case complex exponentials where z k is complex here in discrete time and s sub k is complex here in continuous time , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,26,0,0,341.600,7,8,signalprocessing,represent very broad classes of signals as linear combinations of these will be a topic and an issue that we'll develop in detail over in fact the next set of lectures this lecture and the next set of lectures , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,51,0,0,642.980,36,37,signalprocessing,the other part to the question related to the strategy that we've been pursuing is to hope that these signals can be used as building blocks to represent a very broad class of signals through a linear combination , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,56,0,0,689.770,8,9,signalprocessing,and the representation that's developed in terms of linear combinations of complex exponentials is what's referred to as the fourier transform , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,73,0,0,849.140,51,52,signalprocessing,now what the fourier series says and we'll justify this bit by bit as the discussion goes on what the fourier series says and in fact what fourier said which was essentially his brilliant insight is that if i have a very general periodic signal i can represent it as a linear combination of these harmonically related complex exponentials , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,292,0,0,2992.810,17,18,signalprocessing,the basic strategy with an aperiodic signal is to think of representing this aperiodic signal as a linear combination of complex exponentials by the simple trick of periodically replicating this signal generating a periodic signal using a fourier series representation for that periodic signal and then simply letting the period go to infinity , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,3,0,0,56.260,16,17,signalprocessing,last time we began to address the issue of building continuous time signals out of a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,79.110,19,20,signalprocessing,for periodic signals we had the continuous time fourier series where we built the periodic signal out of a linear combination of harmonically related complex exponentials , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,12,0,0,149.470,23,24,signalprocessing,now what we'd like to do is extend this idea to provide a mechanism for building non periodic signals also out of a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,25,0,0,284.220,19,20,signalprocessing,the fourier series synthesis expression for the periodic signal expresses x tilde of t the periodic signal as a linear combination of harmonically related complex exponentials with the fundamental frequency omega zero equaled to two pi divided by the period , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,3,0,0,55.600,17,18,signalprocessing,in the last two lectures we saw how periodic and non periodic signals could be represented as linear combinations of complex exponentials , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,0,0,105.350,20,21,signalprocessing,the synthesis equation being an equation the tells us how to build the time function out of in essence a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,127.970,11,12,signalprocessing,so essentially in the decomposition of x of t as a linear combination of complex exponentials the complex amplitudes of those are in effect the fourier transform scaled by the differential and scaled by one over two pi , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,115,0,0,1318.220,68,69,signalprocessing,and the final property that i want to draw your attention to on this view graph is the linearity property which is very straightforward to demonstrate from the analysis and synthesis equations which simply says if x one of omega is the fourier transform x one of t and x two of omega is the fourier transform of x two of t then the fourier transform of a linear combination is a linear combination of the fourier transforms , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,134,0,0,1582.260,36,37,signalprocessing,well remember what i said at the beginning of the lecture when i pointed to the synthesis equation and i said in essence the synthesis equation tells us how to decompose x of t as a linear combination of complex exponentials ]

Concept = E22
Keyword = [Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,77,0,0,861.050,24,25,signalprocessing,and in fact if we evaluate the closed form expression through any of a variety of algebraic manipulations we end up then with the analysis equation , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,78,0,0,875.290,2,3,signalprocessing,and the analysis equation which tells us how to get the coefficients a sub k from x of n is what i've indicated here , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,86,0,0,944.280,11,12,signalprocessing,and the analysis equation was an integration as opposed to the synthesis equation which is a summation , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,89,0,0,976.050,7,8,signalprocessing,so we have then to summarize the synthesis equation and the analysis equation for the discrete time fourier series , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,96,0,0,1022.820,8,9,signalprocessing,and in fact if we look at the analysis equation as we let k vary outside the range from zero to n minus one what you can easily verify by substitution in here is that this sequence will in fact periodically repeat , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,174,0,0,1791.760,6,7,signalprocessing,and this is the fourier series synthesis equation where the equation below tells us how we get these fourier coefficients or the envelope from x of n , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,193,0,0,1933.080,4,5,signalprocessing,and we have the synthesis equation which i show as the top equation on this transparency , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,194,0,0,1941.470,9,10,signalprocessing,and this is the integral that the fourier series synthesis equation went to as the period went off to infinity , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,195,0,0,1952.800,5,6,signalprocessing,and we have the corresponding analysis equation which is shown below where this tells us the fourier transform , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,198,0,0,1973.550,7,8,signalprocessing,so we have the analysis equation and synthesis equation , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,226,0,0,2214.670,8,9,signalprocessing,basically if we substitute into the fourier transform analysis equation it's this sum that we evaluate , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,272,0,0,2684.680,15,16,signalprocessing,if we take that impulse train representation and simply plug it into the fourier transform synthesis equation what we end up with is the fourier series synthesis equation , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,277,0,0,2757.500,7,8,signalprocessing,if this expression is substituted into the synthesis equation for the fourier transform that will simply then reduce to the synthesis equation for the fourier series , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,101.310,5,6,signalprocessing,it of course involves a synthesis equation and an analysis equation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,107.040,1,2,signalprocessing,the synthesis equation expressing x of n the sequence in terms of the fourier transform and the analysis equation telling us how to obtain the fourier transform from the original sequence , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,12,0,0,122.890,12,13,signalprocessing,and i draw your attention again to the basic point that the synthesis equation essentially corresponds to decomposing the sequence as a linear combination of complex exponentials with amplitudes that are in effect proportional to the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,105,0,0,1140.650,17,18,signalprocessing,in particular let's think of a discrete time system that is described by a linear constant coefficient difference equation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,108,0,0,1178.720,7,8,signalprocessing,ok now let's consider a first order difference equation a system described by a first order difference equation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,125,0,0,1330.730,12,13,signalprocessing,of course we could do it by attempting to go through the synthesis equation for the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,132,0,0,1396.380,16,17,signalprocessing,here we have the impulse response for that associated with the system described by that particular difference equation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,138,0,0,1459.790,45,46,signalprocessing,so in fact a first order difference equation as we see has a frequency response depending on the value of a that either looks approximately like a lowpass filter for a positive or a highpass filter for a negative very much like the first order differential equation looked like a lowpass filter in the continuous time case , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,139,0,0,1483.710,21,22,signalprocessing,and in fact what i'd like to illustrate is the filtering characteristics or an example of filtering using a first order difference equation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,141,0,0,1512.030,13,14,signalprocessing,and we'll process the dow jones industrial average first through a first order difference equation where if we begin with a equals zero then referring to the frequency response that we have here a equals zero would simply be passing all frequencies , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,144,0,0,1548.270,27,28,signalprocessing,so let's watch the filtering first with a positive and we'll see it behave as a lowpass filter and then with a negative and we'll see the difference equation behaving as a highpass filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,148,0,0,1589.030,12,13,signalprocessing,and what we now want to do is process this through a difference equation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,149,0,0,1596.720,12,13,signalprocessing,above the dow jones average we show the impulse response of the difference equation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,169,0,0,1799.650,10,11,signalprocessing,ok so we see that in fact a first order difference equation is a filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,191,0,0,2044.580,4,5,signalprocessing,here is the general synthesis equation for the fourier series , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,198,0,0,2119.760,11,12,signalprocessing,so we've done it simply by essentially inspecting the fourier series synthesis equation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,261,0,0,2775.710,4,5,signalprocessing,and we saw an analysis equation which tells us how to get these fourier series coefficients through an integration on the original time function , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,264,0,0,2809.380,22,23,signalprocessing,we had then generalized that to the continuous time fourier transform and in effect in doing that what happened is that the synthesis equation in the fourier series became an integral relationship in the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,266,0,0,2855.850,7,8,signalprocessing,and we had of course the corresponding analysis equation that told us how to get x of omega , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,276,0,0,2956.290,19,20,signalprocessing,and we ended up with a relationship describing a representation for aperiodic discrete time signals in which now the synthesis equation went from a summation to an integration since the frequencies are now infinitesimally close involving frequencies only over a two pi interval and for which the amplitude factor x of omega well the amplitude factor is x of omega d omega divided by two pi , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,85,0,0,833.640,8,9,signalprocessing,and we have looked previously at the associated differential equation , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,91,0,0,891.480,5,6,signalprocessing,now we can write the differential equation for either of these systems and as we talked about last time in the last several lectures solve that equation using and exploiting the properties of the fourier transform , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,92,0,0,906.730,8,9,signalprocessing,and in fact if we look at the differential equation relating the capacitor output to the voltage source input we recognize that this is an example that in effect we've solved previously , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,93,0,0,921.740,13,14,signalprocessing,and so just working our way down applying the fourier transform to the differential equation and generating the system function by taking the ratio of the capacitor voltage or its fourier transform to the fourier transform of the source we then have the system function associated with the system for which the output is the capacitor voltage , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,195,0,0,1714.020,4,5,signalprocessing,so in fact the difference equation let's say for three point moving average would be the difference equation that i indicate here just simply taking a data point and the two data points adjacent to it and forming an average of those three , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,243,0,0,2149.530,7,8,signalprocessing,recursive filters are filters for which the difference equation has feedback from the output back into the input , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,245,0,0,2166.910,9,10,signalprocessing,so for example as i've stressed previously a recursive difference equation has the general form that i indicate here a linear combination of weighted outputs on the left hand side and linear combination of weighted inputs on the right hand side , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,247,0,0,2198.610,21,22,signalprocessing,for example just to interpret this focus on the interpretation of this as a filter let's look at a first order difference equation which we've talked about and generated the solution to previously , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,248,0,0,2212.770,4,5,signalprocessing,so the first order difference equation would be as i indicated here , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,253,0,0,2257.540,6,7,signalprocessing,and so interpreting the first order difference equation as a system what we're attempting to generate is the frequency response which is the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,254,0,0,2272.760,3,4,signalprocessing,and from the difference equation we can of course solve for either one of those by using the properties exploiting the properties of fourier transform , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,255,0,0,2283.770,6,7,signalprocessing,applying the fourier transform to the difference equation we will end up with the fourier transform of the output equal to the fourier transform of the input times this factor which we know from the convolution property in fact is the frequency response of the system , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,258,0,0,2317.910,14,15,signalprocessing,so we have the frequency response obtained by applying the fourier transform to the difference equation the impulse response , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,14,0,0,158.800,9,10,signalprocessing,and in what we had referred to as the synthesis equation the synthesis equation corresponded to in effect a decomposition as a linear combination a decomposition of x of t as a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,15,0,0,176.980,9,10,signalprocessing,and of course associated with this was the corresponding analysis equation that in effect gave us the amplitudes associated with the complex exponentials , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,99,0,0,972.980,38,39,signalprocessing,and if you go through this and in fact you'll have an opportunity to go through this both in the video course manual and also it's carried through in the text what you end up with is a synthesis equation an expression for x of t in terms of x of s which corresponds to a synthesis equation , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,50,0,0,536.010,9,10,signalprocessing,let's begin first of all with a first order differential equation , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,52,0,0,546.500,14,15,signalprocessing,what i mean by that is a system that's characterized by a first order differential equation , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,66,0,0,686.970,16,17,signalprocessing,so we have to decide which region of convergence that we pick and it's not the differential equation that will tell us that it's something else that has to give us that information , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,72,0,0,740.600,16,17,signalprocessing,so a very important point is that what we see is that the linear constant coefficient differential equation gives us the algebraic expression for the system function but does not tell us about the region of convergence , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,78,0,0,789.340,1,2,signalprocessing,the differential equation by itself does not completely specify the system it only essentially tells us what the algebraic expression is for the system function , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,80,0,0,801.950,10,11,signalprocessing,let's now look at a second order system and the differential equation that i picked in this case , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,82,0,0,814.150,6,7,signalprocessing,in particular it's a second order differential equation and i chosen just for simplicity to not include any derivatives on the right hand side although we could have , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,85,0,0,840.840,4,5,signalprocessing,that would convert this differential equation to an algebraic equation , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,7,0,0,101.750,4,5,signalprocessing,so this was the synthesis equation , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,0,0,105.430,7,8,signalprocessing,and of course there is the corresponding analysis equation , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,176,0,0,1783.260,9,10,signalprocessing,is the z transform associated with a second order difference equation , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,56,0,0,715.380,11,12,signalprocessing,so let's do that by first looking at a first order difference equation , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,57,0,0,722.480,7,8,signalprocessing,in the case of a first order difference equation which i've written as i indicate here , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,60,0,0,754.180,43,44,signalprocessing,so using those properties and together with the shifting property the property that tells us that the z transform of y of n minus one is z to the minus one times the z transform of y of n we then convert the difference equation to an algebraic expression , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,66,0,0,842.670,19,20,signalprocessing,well we have the same issue here as we had with the laplace transform namely the point that the difference equation tells us in essence what the algebraic expression is for the system function but doesn't specify the region of convergence , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,68,0,0,880.130,12,13,signalprocessing,if i let's say imposed on this system in addition to the difference equation the condition of causality then what that requires is that the impulse response be right sided or the region of convergence be outside the outermost pole , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,119,0,0,1401.960,26,27,signalprocessing,now if we want to map continuous time filters to discrete time filters then in continuous time we're talking about a system function and an associated differential equation , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,120,0,0,1417.840,12,13,signalprocessing,in discrete time there is the corresponding system function and the corresponding difference equation , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,135,0,0,1610.280,20,21,signalprocessing,the first one that i want to talk about is the more or less intuitive simple procedure of mapping a differential equation to a difference equation by simply replacing derivatives by differences , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,139,0,0,1644.870,4,5,signalprocessing,if we take the differential equation and do this with all the derivatives both in terms of y of t and x of t what we'll end up with is a difference equation , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,143,0,0,1684.740,17,18,signalprocessing,so in effect what it says is that every place in the system function or in the differential equation that we would be multiplying by s when laplace transformed , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,144,0,0,1696.460,2,3,signalprocessing,in the difference equation we would be multiplying by this factor , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,125.310,26,27,signalprocessing,and for example if n were equal to one then this would simply correspond to the magnitude squared of the frequency response for a first order differential equation , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,130,0,0,1573.570,31,32,signalprocessing,and let me just say quickly and in passing that although we won't go through this the notion that the bilinear transformation can be tied to the concept of taking the differential equation for the continuous time filter converting it to an integral equation by integrating enough times on both sides and then converting that to a difference equation by approximating the integrals with the trapezoidal rule , Lecture25FeedbackMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,290,0,0,2602.800,11,12,signalprocessing,ok so what we've seen in today's lecture is the basic analysis equation and a few of the applications , Lecture26FeedbackExampleTheInvertedPendulumMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,59,1,0,522.419,5,6,signalprocessing,so this is then the differential equation associated with the open loop system the basic dynamics of the system , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,225,0,0,2150.410,39,40,signalprocessing,but while we're on the accumulator i just want to draw your attention to the fact which will kind of come up in a variety of ways again later that we can rewrite the equation for an accumulator the difference equation by recognizing that we could in fact write the output as the accumulated values up to time n one and then add on the last value , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,227,0,0,2183.510,6,7,signalprocessing,and so we could rewrite this difference equation as y n y n one x n , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,229,0,0,2196.800,13,14,signalprocessing,expressed that way what that corresponds to is what is called a recursive difference equation , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,240,0,0,2264.630,4,5,signalprocessing,so we have a difference equation that describes for us how the impulse is related to the step , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,242,0,0,2281.420,21,22,signalprocessing,and so if we think of x two n as the input and y two n as the output then the difference equation for the inverse system is what i've indicated here , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,255,0,0,2380.200,12,13,signalprocessing,and let me just quickly point to one example which is a difference equation as i've indicated here , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,259,0,0,2436.550,7,8,signalprocessing,and likewise for a linear constant coefficient differential equation the specific one that i've indicated here under the assumption of initial rest the impulse response is e two t times u t , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,12,0,0,163.650,15,16,signalprocessing,well let's first consider what i refer to as an nth order linear constant coefficient differential equation as i've indicated here , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,18,0,0,222.410,13,14,signalprocessing,in the discrete time case the corresponding equation is a linear constant coefficient difference equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,20,0,0,242.630,8,9,signalprocessing,this equation is referred to an nth order difference equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,21,0,0,247.290,17,18,signalprocessing,the n referring to the number of delays of the output involved just as an nth order differential equation the n or the order of the equation refers to the number of derivatives of the output , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,24,0,0,299.910,4,5,signalprocessing,so in fact this differential equation by itself is not a unique specification of the system , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,27,0,0,324.630,5,6,signalprocessing,by simply substituting into the differential equation the sum of a particular and the homogeneous solution and what you'll see is that the homogeneous contribution in fact goes to zero by definition of what we mean by the homogeneous equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,28,0,0,344.670,9,10,signalprocessing,now the homogeneous solution for a linear constant coefficient differential equation is of the form that i indicate at the bottom , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,38,0,0,454.980,17,18,signalprocessing,so what this says is that in order to obtain the solution for a linear constant coefficient differential equation we need some kind of auxiliary information that tells us is how to obtain these n undetermined constants , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,40,0,0,477.930,6,7,signalprocessing,for example in addition to the differential equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,42,0,0,495.300,3,4,signalprocessing,and so the differential equation together with the auxiliary information the initial conditions then lets you determine the total solution which namely lets you determine these previously unspecified coefficients in the homogeneous solution , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,54,0,0,640.500,16,17,signalprocessing,ok well let's look at an example and let's take the example of a first order differential equation as i've indicated here , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,55,0,0,654.470,6,7,signalprocessing,so we have a first order differential equation dy t dt ay t is the input x t , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,69,0,0,768.540,10,11,signalprocessing,and you can verify that simply by substituting into the differential equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,80,0,0,883.960,26,27,signalprocessing,in essence we can consider two linear time invariant systems in cascade one a differentiator the other the system that we're talking about described by the differential equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,93,0,0,1019.290,19,20,signalprocessing,okay so what we've seen then is the impulse response for a system described by a linear constant coefficient differential equation where in addition we would impose causality linearity and time invariance essentially through the initial conditions of initial rest , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,95,0,0,1049.740,17,18,signalprocessing,in particular again let me remind you of the form of an nth order linear constant coefficient difference equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,98,0,0,1071.520,2,3,signalprocessing,once again difference equation is not a complete specification of the system because we can add to the response any homogeneous solution , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,99,0,0,1083.820,20,21,signalprocessing,in other words any solution that satisfies the homogeneous equation and the sum of those will also satisfy the original difference equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,100,0,0,1093.910,10,11,signalprocessing,so if we have a particular response that satisfies the difference equation then adding to that any response that is a solution to the homogeneous equation will also be a solution to the total equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,110,0,0,1201.990,10,11,signalprocessing,so the general form then for the solution to the difference equation is a sum of exponentials plus any particular solution , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,121,0,0,1312.210,26,27,signalprocessing,in fact one difference between them that in some sense makes difference equations easier to deal with in some situations is that in contrast to a differential equation a difference equation if we assume causality in fact is an explicit input output relationship for the system , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,123,0,0,1338.670,5,6,signalprocessing,let's consider the nth order difference equation as i've indicated here , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,132,0,0,1423.390,13,14,signalprocessing,well let's look at this specifically in the context of a first order difference equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,133,0,0,1430.160,6,7,signalprocessing,so let's take a first order difference equation as i've indicated here , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,136,0,0,1456.780,6,7,signalprocessing,we can rewrite the first order difference equation by taking the term involving y n one over two the right hand side of the equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,158,0,0,1645.750,17,18,signalprocessing,and now of course if we want to generate the more general set of solutions to this difference equation we can do that by adding all of the homogeneous solutions namely all the solutions that satisfy the homogeneous equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,172,0,0,1812.480,11,12,signalprocessing,let's now look at the difference equation and then later the differential equation interpreted in block diagram terms , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,173,0,0,1823.190,2,3,signalprocessing,now the difference equation as i just simply repeated here is y n x n ay n one where i've taken the delayed term over to the right hand side of the equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,184,0,0,1957.580,5,6,signalprocessing,well we know that the difference equation requires initial conditions , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,193,0,0,2062.960,2,3,signalprocessing,now the difference equation says that we want to take these and multiply them by the appropriate coefficients the coefficients in the difference equation and so we can do that as i've indicated here , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,200,0,0,2116.690,14,15,signalprocessing,which is a general block diagram for implementing or representing a linear constant coefficient difference equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,203,0,0,2141.680,12,13,signalprocessing,that it's only one of many possible algorithms or implementations for this difference equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,221,0,0,2290.180,17,18,signalprocessing,and one advantage simply stated is that when you think in terms of an implementation of a difference equation a delay corresponds to a storage register a memory location and by simply using the fact that we can interchange the order in which linear time invariant systems are cascaded we can reduce the amount of memory by a factor of two , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,225,0,0,2340.870,7,8,signalprocessing,so let's consider a linear constant coefficient differential equation as i've indicated here and i have terms on the left side and terms on the right side , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,226,0,0,2353.930,3,4,signalprocessing,and with the differential equation let's consider taking all the terms over to the right side of the equation except for the highest derivative in the output , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,237,0,0,2465.180,12,13,signalprocessing,so just as we did with the difference equation we've converted the differential equation to an integral equation and we have a block diagram form very similar to what we had in the case of the difference equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,245,0,0,2532.090,11,12,signalprocessing,and what you can see just as we saw with the difference equation is that now the integrators both integrators are integrating the same thing , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,250,0,0,2578.060,13,14,signalprocessing,very much similar to what we talked about in the case of the difference equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,251,0,0,2583.630,10,11,signalprocessing,now let's just again with the integral equation or the differential equation look at this somewhat more generally , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,252,0,0,2593.270,5,6,signalprocessing,again if we take the differential equation the general differential equation integrate it a sufficient number of times to convert it to an integral equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,260,0,0,2658.330,18,19,signalprocessing,so we've seen that the situation is very similar here as it was in the case of the difference equation , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,117,0,0,1400.540,12,13,signalprocessing,so that in effect then is what we refer to as the analysis equation the equation that begins with x t and tells us how to get the fourier series coefficients , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,118,0,0,1414.260,8,9,signalprocessing,what i'll refer to as the fourier series synthesis equation is the equation that tells us how to build x t out of these complex exponentials , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,119,0,0,1428.340,4,5,signalprocessing,so we have the synthesis equation which is the one we started from , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,120,0,0,1433.070,3,4,signalprocessing,we have the analysis equation which is the equation that we just developed , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,191,0,0,2043.480,9,10,signalprocessing,so here we have the expression which is the synthesis equation telling us how x t could be represented as complex exponentials if it can be , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,238,0,0,2477.140,8,9,signalprocessing,and so if we look again at the synthesis equation what we really want to ask is if we add up enough of these terms in what sense does this sum represent this time function , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,7,0,0,94.750,12,13,signalprocessing,and what that led to was what we referred to as the synthesis equation , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,0,0,123.090,15,16,signalprocessing,then the other side of the fourier series is what i referred to as the analysis equation , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,130.380,2,3,signalprocessing,and the analysis equation was the equation that told us how we get the fourier series coefficients from x of t , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,139.110,7,8,signalprocessing,and so this equation together with the synthesis equation represent the fourier series description for periodic signals , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,26,0,0,304.370,2,3,signalprocessing,and the analysis equation tells us what the relationship is for the coefficients in terms of the periodic signal , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,38,0,0,443.770,8,9,signalprocessing,and that in effect will correspond to an analysis equation to represent the aperiodic signal , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,39,0,0,452.280,5,6,signalprocessing,now let's look at the synthesis equation , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,43,0,0,497.440,3,4,signalprocessing,specifically then the synthesis equation that we have is what i've indicated here , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,46,0,0,542.740,13,14,signalprocessing,so the resulting equation that we get out of the original fourier series synthesis equation is the equation that i indicate down here x of t synthesized in terms of this integral which is what the fourier series approaches as omega zero goes to zero , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,48,0,0,576.900,8,9,signalprocessing,and we have then the corresponding fourier transform analysis equation which tells us how we arrive at that envelope in terms of x of t , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,49,0,0,589.930,9,10,signalprocessing,so we now have an analysis equation and a synthesis equation which in effect expresses for us how to build x of t in terms of infinitesimally finely spaced complex exponentials , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,69,0,0,826.300,18,19,signalprocessing,so what we have then is now our fourier transform representation the continuous time fourier transform with the synthesis equation expressed as an integral as i've indicated here and this integral is what the fourier series sum went to as we let the period go to infinity or the frequency go to zero , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,70,0,0,854.720,2,3,signalprocessing,the corresponding analysis equation which we have here , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,71,0,0,859.080,1,2,signalprocessing,the analysis equation being the expression for the envelope of the fourier series coefficients for the periodically replicated signal , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,141,0,0,1650.860,5,6,signalprocessing,specifically here is then the synthesis equation for the fourier transform if we substitute this definition for the fourier transform of the periodic signal into this expression then when we do the appropriate bookkeeping and interchange the order of summation and integration the impulse integrates out to the exponential factor that we want , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,144,0,0,1687.990,15,16,signalprocessing,the two pis take care of each other and what we're left with is the synthesis equation for aperiodic signal in terms of the fourier transform or in terms of its fourier series coefficients , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,161,0,0,1913.210,71,72,signalprocessing,then the third step that we took was to inquire as to whether there is a fourier transform that can appropriately be defined for the periodic signal and the mechanism for doing that was to recognize that if we simply defined the fourier transform of the periodic signal as an impulse train where the impulse heights or areas were proportional to the fourier series coefficients then in fact the fourier transform synthesis equation reduced to the fourier series synthesis equation , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,0,0,105.350,1,2,signalprocessing,the synthesis equation being an equation the tells us how to build the time function out of in essence a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,0,0,117.060,2,3,signalprocessing,and the analysis equation telling us how to get the amplitudes of those complex exponentials from the associated time function , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,68,0,0,723.790,7,8,signalprocessing,in particular if we look at the synthesis equation which i repeat here and the analysis equation which i repeat below it what we observe is that in fact these equations are basically identical except for the fact that in the top integral we have things as a function of omega in the bottom integral as a function of t and there's a factor of one over two pi and by the way a minus sign , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,134,0,0,1582.260,16,17,signalprocessing,well remember what i said at the beginning of the lecture when i pointed to the synthesis equation and i said in essence the synthesis equation tells us how to decompose x of t as a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,202,0,0,2341.400,14,15,signalprocessing,and we're also going to assume then it's characterized by a linear constant coefficient differential equation where we're going to impose the condition that it's causal linear and time invariant or equivalently that the initial conditions are consistent with the initial rest , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,204,0,0,2378.940,9,10,signalprocessing,so let's take as our example a first order differential equation as i indicate here , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,236,0,0,2636.240,30,31,signalprocessing,and given just the little bit of discussion that we had previously about filtering you should be able to infer something about the filtering characteristics of this simple first order differential equation , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,238,0,0,2668.160,43,44,signalprocessing,so in fact you could think of the defocusing that we did on the image of fourier you could think of that approximately as similar to the kind of filtering action that you would get by passing a signal through a first order differential equation , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,242,0,0,2721.930,10,11,signalprocessing,but let's do it instead by going back to the differential equation , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,243,0,0,2727.890,6,7,signalprocessing,and so here i'm taking a differential equation ]

Concept = US03
Keyword = [Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,227,0,0,2222.830,4,5,signalprocessing,because we have a unit step here which shuts this off for n less than zero we can change the limits on the sum , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,319,0,0,2971.870,23,24,signalprocessing,and the inverse transform of this is now again referring to the same example minus e to the minus two t times the unit step , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,332,0,0,3090.970,64,65,signalprocessing,and so in fact the answer that we will get when we decompose this use the partial fraction expansion being very careful about associating the region of convergence of this pole to the right and of this pole to the left we'll have then when we're all done a time function which will be of the form e to the minus t times the unit step for t positive , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,95,0,0,1004.280,18,19,signalprocessing,let's consider first of all an exponential sequence x of n equals a to the n times the unit step , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,105,0,0,1062.740,24,25,signalprocessing,the z transform is the sum from minus infinity to plus infinity of a to the n z to the minus n times the unit step , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,106,0,0,1076.480,1,2,signalprocessing,the unit step will change the lower limit to zero , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,188,0,0,2255.440,17,18,signalprocessing,we're sampling at t equals n capital t and so we've replaced that here and then the unit step to truncate things for negative time , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,5,0,0,82.540,13,14,signalprocessing,in today's lecture i'd like to introduce some additional basic signals specifically the unit step and unit impulse signal , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,91.830,9,10,signalprocessing,let's begin with discrete time and the discrete time unit step and unit impulse , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,7,0,0,98.820,3,4,signalprocessing,the discrete time unit step is a sequence as i've indicated here specifically a sequence which is zero for negative values of its argument and equal to one for positive values of its argument and zero , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,0,0,118.970,3,4,signalprocessing,so mathematically the unit step sequence is one for n greater than or equal to zero and zero for n less than zero , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,151.210,2,3,signalprocessing,so the unit step and unit impulse sequence are defined in a straightforward way mathematically , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,13,0,0,165.170,2,3,signalprocessing,specifically the unit impulse can be related to the unit step through the relationship that i've indicated here delta of n the unit impulse equal to a unit step minus the unit step delayed , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,15,0,0,194.180,14,15,signalprocessing,and to see the validity of this expression we can simply look at the unit step and its delayed version , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,16,0,0,204.380,5,6,signalprocessing,so here we show the unit step u n , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,17,0,0,209.400,4,5,signalprocessing,here we show the unit step delayed by one , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,19,0,0,217.890,11,12,signalprocessing,and clearly if we subtract the delayed step from the original unit step everything subtracts out except at n zero at which point the difference is equal to one , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,21,0,0,246.490,9,10,signalprocessing,now in a similar way we can express the unit step in terms of the unit impulse , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,25,0,0,268.260,17,18,signalprocessing,if we think of forming the sum from minus infinity up to some value n of a unit impulse or unit sample then this running sum in fact is equal to the unit step , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,30,0,0,326.900,11,12,signalprocessing,so we have then one expression for the relationship between the unit step and the unit sample , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,31,0,0,334.700,16,17,signalprocessing,we can also develop another relationship by observing in essence that if we look at the unit step sequence as i've returned to here we can in effect think of the unit step sequence as a succession of unit impulses one following another , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,33,0,0,390.160,16,17,signalprocessing,and when we continue to add these up then what they add up to is the unit step sequence , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,36,0,0,420.270,10,11,signalprocessing,we will find it equally useful to talk about a unit step continuous time signal and a unit impulse continuous time signal , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,37,0,0,430.550,6,7,signalprocessing,let's begin with the continuous time unit step , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,38,0,0,436.670,3,4,signalprocessing,the continuous time unit step function is graphically indicated as i've shown here , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,44,0,0,488.460,5,6,signalprocessing,and one can define the unit step at t zero in a variety of ways but the essential point is that the unit step function is discontinuous , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,45,0,0,501.220,12,13,signalprocessing,so in effect what we need to do is think of the unit step function as the limit of a continuous function , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,48,0,0,535.450,9,10,signalprocessing,and so we can think then of the discontinuous unit step as the limiting form of u delta t as delta goes to zero , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,52,0,0,562.130,21,22,signalprocessing,and to motivate the definition let me return to the discrete time definition or rather the discrete time relationship between the unit step and the unit impulse function , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,53,0,0,577.010,7,8,signalprocessing,in discrete time we saw that the unit impulse function is the first difference of the unit step function , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,54,0,0,590.790,19,20,signalprocessing,well similarly in continuous time we can talk about an impulse function which is the first derivative of a unit step function , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,55,0,0,605.030,2,3,signalprocessing,so the unit impulse as we want to define it is the derivative of the unit step , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,56,0,0,611.850,10,11,signalprocessing,of course we just finished discussing the fact that the unit step function is in fact discontinuous at t zero , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,57,0,0,621.710,14,15,signalprocessing,but we can think of its derivative as related to this approximation to the unit step , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,59,0,0,642.540,4,5,signalprocessing,so to define the unit impulse we think of the derivative of this approximation to the unit step and then observe what happens as delta goes to zero , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,60,0,0,655.440,7,8,signalprocessing,we have then the definition of the unit impulse function more or less formally defined as the first derivative of the unit step or thought of as the limiting form of the derivative of the approximation to the unit step in the limit as delta the duration of the discontinuity goes to zero , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,70,0,0,783.380,11,12,signalprocessing,and in this case since we took the derivative of a unit step the height is equal to one , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,72,0,0,799.360,15,16,signalprocessing,it's mathematically not terribly comfortable because what we've done is taken the derivative of the unit step which has a discontinuity at the origin and there's some mathematical difficulties in doing that , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,82,0,0,885.370,8,9,signalprocessing,in fact mathematically the relationship is that the unit step function in continuous time is the running integral of the unit impulse function , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,30,0,0,352.640,13,14,signalprocessing,and more or less as we did when we talked about representing a unit step in terms of impulses we can think of this general sequence as a sequence of impulses delayed namely occurring at the appropriate time instant and with the appropriate amplitude , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,110,0,0,1345.960,34,35,signalprocessing,so returning to the expression for the convolution sum as i show here the sum of x k h n k let's focus in on an example where we choose x n as a unit step and h n as a real exponential times the a unit step , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,157,0,0,1810.930,11,12,signalprocessing,so here is our example with x t equal to a unit step and h t now a real exponential times a unit step , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,158,0,0,1822.280,8,9,signalprocessing,i show here x t which is the unit step function , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,200,0,0,2253.080,8,9,signalprocessing,the example of an input which is a unit step and an impulse response which is a real exponential multiplied by a unit step we have then replacing x k by what we know the input to be and h n k by what we know the impulse response to be the output is the expression that we have here , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,204,0,0,2311.100,30,31,signalprocessing,in particular let's look at the sum and what we observe first of all is that the limits on this sum are going to be modified depending on where this unit step is zero and non zero , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,205,0,0,2330.390,26,27,signalprocessing,in particular if we first consider what will turn out to be the simple case namely n less than zero for n less than zero this unit step is zero for k greater than n , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,206,0,0,2350.640,9,10,signalprocessing,with n less than zero that means that this unit step never is non zero for k positive , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,207,0,0,2361.480,5,6,signalprocessing,on the other hand this unit step is never non zero or always zero for k negative , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,208,0,0,2371.350,14,15,signalprocessing,let me just stress that by looking at the particular graphs here is the unit step u k , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,209,0,0,2380.840,3,4,signalprocessing,here is the unit step u n k and for n less than zero so that this point comes before this point the product of these two is equal to zero , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,214,0,0,2430.470,17,18,signalprocessing,if we just look back at the summation that we had the summation now corresponds to this unit step and this unit step having some overlap , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,215,0,0,2448.260,15,16,signalprocessing,so for interval two corresponding to n greater than zero we have u k the unit step , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,216,0,0,2460.150,8,9,signalprocessing,we have u n k which is a unit step going backward in time but which extends for positive values of n , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,218,0,0,2484.320,11,12,signalprocessing,well for k starting at zero corresponding to one of the unit steps and ending at n corresponding to the other unit step , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,253,0,0,2825.070,10,11,signalprocessing,our example you recall was with x t as a unit step and h t as an exponential times a unit step , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,258,0,0,2880.300,6,7,signalprocessing,for t less than zero this unit step which only begins at tau zero and this unit step which is zero by the time tau gets up to t and beyond , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,259,0,0,2896.170,10,11,signalprocessing,for t less than zero there's no overlap between the unit step going forward in time and the unit step going backward in time , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,262,0,0,2928.070,14,15,signalprocessing,in that case what happens again is that the overlap in essence of the unit step tells us gives us a range on the integration in particular the two steps overlap when t is greater than zero from tau zero to tau t , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,264,0,0,2959.370,4,5,signalprocessing,this product of this unit step and this unit step is equal to one in this range and so that allows us then to change the limits on the integral instead of from infinity to infinity we know that the integrand is non zero only over this range , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,20,0,0,278.930,31,32,signalprocessing,and in fact in the lecture last time we worked an example where we had in discrete time an impulse response which was an exponential and an input which is a unit step , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,28,0,0,338.740,15,16,signalprocessing,in other words the text works the example where the system impulse response is a unit step , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,338,0,0,3083.460,11,12,signalprocessing,of course the impulse response of a single integrator is a unit step , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,339,0,0,3087.580,8,9,signalprocessing,two integrators together is the integral of a unit step et cetera , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,342,0,0,3116.000,16,17,signalprocessing,and for example with a single integrator u sub minus one of t corresponds to our unit step as we talked about previously u sub minus two of t corresponds to a unit ramp et cetera , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,66,0,0,743.150,10,11,signalprocessing,let's consider for example an input which is a scaled unit step ,

exponential times a unit step , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,84,0,0,929.310,16,17,signalprocessing,here again is the step response as we just worked it

Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,259,0,0,2835.440,35,36,signalprocessing,we now have the sum of two terms and if we now recognize by inspection the inverse fourier transform of this we see that it's simply minus e to the minus two t times the unit step , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,260,0,0,2853.720,11,12,signalprocessing,this one is plus e to the minus t times the unit step ]

Keyword = [Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,7,0,0,106.110,3,4,signalprocessing,for example a sinusoidal signal has three parameters amplitude frequency and phase , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,0,0,114.520,18,19,signalprocessing,and we could think for example of using one signal to vary let's say the amplitude of a sinusoidal signal , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,0,0,124.730,17,18,signalprocessing,and what that leads to is a notion which we'll develop in some detail referred to as sinusoidal amplitude modulation and would correspond to a sinusoidal signal referred to as the carrier and it's amplitude being varied on the basis of another signal , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,147.700,15,16,signalprocessing,now alternatively we could think of varying either the frequency or the phase of a sinusoidal signal again with another signal , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,20,0,0,237.480,47,48,signalprocessing,now also a notion that that leads to and we'll be developing in some detail is the idea that you can simultaneously transmit more than one signal by in essence taking several voice signals or other signals using them to modulate either the frequency or amplitude of sinusoidal signals at different frequencies adding all those together that's a process called multiplexing and then at the other end of the transmission system taking those sinusoidal signals apart , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,151,0,0,1412.410,12,13,signalprocessing,so we are talking about a carrier signal which is simply a sinusoidal signal with some phase , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,267,0,0,2430.660,24,25,signalprocessing,well to indicate where the tradeoff comes from or where the issue surfaces notice that what we're doing is tracking the envelope of the sinusoidal signal , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,262,0,0,1586.130,12,13,signalprocessing,another thing we can do is to vary the frequency of the sinusoidal signal that's modulating it , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,92,0,0,1287.650,15,16,signalprocessing,and the carrier signal in this particular case is a pulse train rather than a sinusoidal signal , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,95,0,0,1312.490,10,11,signalprocessing,and previously we've talked about a carrier signal which is sinusoidal signal , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,41,1,0,552.290,32,33,signalprocessing,and in order to both understand that term better and to understand in fact the effect better it's useful to examine this a little more closely for the specific example of a sinusoidal signal , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,43,1,0,569.500,18,19,signalprocessing,and what we want to look at is the effect of aliasing when our input signal is a sinusoidal signal , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,47,1,0,600.530,10,11,signalprocessing,well what we have is an input signal is a sinusoidal signal , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,106,1,0,1184.490,8,9,signalprocessing,so we've seen the effect of aliasing for sinusoidal signals in terms of waveforms , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,5,0,0,81.020,8,9,signalprocessing,let's begin with one signal the continuous time sinusoidal signal which perhaps you're already somewhat familiar with , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,89.650,4,5,signalprocessing,mathematically the continuous time sinusoidal signal is expressed as i've indicated here , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,0,0,114.950,5,6,signalprocessing,and graphically the continuous time sinusoidal signal has the form shown here , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,124.440,2,3,signalprocessing,now the sinusoidal signal has a number of important properties that we'll find it convenient to exploit as the course goes along one of which is the fact that the sinusoidal signal is what is referred to as periodic , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,13,0,0,171.420,15,16,signalprocessing,and we can demonstrate it mathematically by simply substituting into the mathematical expression for the sinusoidal signal t t zero in place of t , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,21,0,0,248.750,5,6,signalprocessing,and going back to our sinusoidal signal we can see that and i've indicated here then the period as two pi omega zero , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,23,0,0,270.160,8,9,signalprocessing,now in addition a useful property of the sinusoidal signal is the fact that a time shift of a sinusoid is equivalent to a phase change , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,24,0,0,284.290,13,14,signalprocessing,and we can demonstrate that again mathematically in particular if we put the sinusoidal signal under a time shift , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,29,0,0,362.970,10,11,signalprocessing,and so for example if we look at the general sinusoidal signal that we saw previously in effect changing the phase corresponds to moving this signal in time one way or the other , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,30,0,0,382.990,7,8,signalprocessing,for example if we look at the sinusoidal signal with a phase equal to zero that corresponds to locating the time origin at this peak , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,48,0,0,534.600,21,22,signalprocessing,so illustrated below is the graph now when we have a phase of pi two in our cosine which is a sinusoidal signal , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,55,0,0,598.390,14,15,signalprocessing,and we'll find many occasions not only to refer to signals more general than sinusoidal signals as even in some cases and odd in other cases , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,60,0,0,639.900,6,8,signalprocessing,so this is the class of continuous time sinusoids , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,62,0,0,646.470,7,9,signalprocessing,but i'd now like to turn to discrete time sinusoids , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,63,0,0,651.720,5,7,signalprocessing,what we'll see is that discrete time sinusoids are very much like continuous time ones but also with some very important differences , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,66,0,0,670.530,3,4,signalprocessing,a discrete time sinusoidal signal mathematically is as i've indicated here a cos omega zero n phi , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,68,0,0,699.820,7,8,signalprocessing,and i've illustrated here several discrete time sinusoidal signals , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,84,0,0,831.390,8,9,signalprocessing,and for example if we take a particular sinusoidal signal , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,108,0,0,1031.839,10,12,signalprocessing,now one of the things i've said so far about discrete time sinusoids is that a time shift corresponds to a phase change , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,126,0,0,1176.190,9,11,signalprocessing,and what we'll see is that again whereas in continuous time all continuous time sinusoids are periodic in the discrete time case that is not necessarily true , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,127,0,0,1191.480,16,17,signalprocessing,to explore that a little more carefully let's look at the expression again for a general sinusoidal signal with an arbitrary amplitude frequency and phase , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,139,0,0,1299.850,7,8,signalprocessing,for example let's look at some particular sinusoidal signals , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,147,0,0,1349.890,7,8,signalprocessing,so what that says is that this sinusoidal signal is periodic , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,161,0,0,1438.350,13,14,signalprocessing,so in fact what that says is that if you look at this sinusoidal signal it's not periodic at all even though you might fool yourself into thinking it is simply because the envelope looks periodic , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,164,0,0,1467.180,10,11,signalprocessing,well we've seen then some important distinctions between continuous time sinusoidal signals and discrete time sinusoidal signals , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,168,0,0,1504.850,15,16,signalprocessing,in particular for the continuous time case if we have a general expression for the sinusoidal signal that i've indicated here that's periodic for any choice of omega zero , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,173,0,0,1597.890,6,7,signalprocessing,in particular if i consider these sinusoidal continuous time signals as i vary omega zero what will happen is that i will always see different sinusoidal signals , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,178,0,0,1629.670,14,15,signalprocessing,and the statement that i'm making is that if i have two discrete time sinusoidal signals at two different frequencies and if these frequencies are separated by an integer multiple of two pi namely if omega two is equal to omega one point two pi times an integer m when i substitute this into this expression because of the fact that n is also an integer i'll have m n as an integer multiple of two pi , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,180,0,0,1676.350,29,30,signalprocessing,on the other hand in the continuous time case since t is not restricted to be an integer variable for different values of omega one and omega two these sinusoidal signals will always be different , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,182,0,0,1697.650,13,14,signalprocessing,now many of the issues that i've raised so far in relation to sinusoidal signals are elaborated on in more detail in the text , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,184,0,0,1716.150,4,5,signalprocessing,let me stress that sinusoidal signals will play an extremely important role for us as building blocks for general signals and descriptions of systems and leads to the whole concept fourier analysis which is very heavily exploited throughout the course , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,187,0,0,1746.820,4,5,signalprocessing,these relate strongly to sinusoidal signals namely the class of real and complex exponentials , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,244,0,0,2202.580,7,8,signalprocessing,and what this corresponds to are two sinusoidal signals ninety degrees out of phase as indicated by the fact that there's a cosine and a sine , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,248,0,0,2239.070,8,9,signalprocessing,what i've indicated at the top is a sinusoidal signal with a time varying exponential envelope or an envelope which is a real exponential and in particular which is growing namely with r greater than zero , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,250,0,0,2266.240,4,5,signalprocessing,and this kind of sinusoidal signal by the way is typically referred to as a damped sinusoid , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,292,0,0,2623.230,5,6,signalprocessing,and those together with the sinusoidal signals and exponentials as we've talked about today will really form the cornerstone for essentially all of the signal and system analysis that we'll be dealing with for the remainder of course , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,194,0,0,2230.080,33,34,signalprocessing,and what the modulation property as we'll see when we explore it in more detail tells us is that if we have a signal with a certain spectrum and we multiply by a sinusoidal signal whose fourier transform is a set of impulses then in a frequency domain we convolve , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,195,0,0,2251.500,24,25,signalprocessing,and that corresponds to taking the original spectrum and translating it shifting it in frequency up to the frequency of the carrier namely the sinusoidal signal ]

Keyword = [Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,130,0,0,1342.330,10,11,signalprocessing,in this case the complex plane referred to as the z plane whereas in continuous time when we talked about the laplace transform it was the s plane z of course because z is the complex variable in terms of which we're representing the z transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,137,0,0,1408.880,8,9,signalprocessing,and so it's on this contour in the z plane that the z transform reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,143,0,0,1467.700,5,6,signalprocessing,and so for the rational z transforms we'll again find it convenient to use a representation in terms of poles and zeroes in the z plane , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,243,0,0,2444.060,11,12,signalprocessing,furthermore the region of convergence consists of a ring in the z plane centered about the origin , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,248,0,0,2487.350,16,17,signalprocessing,and so the region of convergence you would expect to be a concentric ring in the z plane , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,249,0,0,2496.420,30,31,signalprocessing,furthermore as we've already talked about and exploited actually convergence of the fourier transform is equivalent to the statement that the region of convergence includes the unit circle in the z plane , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,254,0,0,2567.130,19,20,signalprocessing,so if x of n is a finite duration then in fact the region of convergence is the entire z plane possibly with the exception of the origin or infinity , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,266,0,0,2701.590,16,17,signalprocessing,and so in that case then the region of convergence will be a ring in the z plane and essentially will extend outward to a pole and inward to a pole , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,302,0,0,3052.970,6,7,signalprocessing,here the unit circle in the z plane plays an important role , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,40,0,0,511.160,21,22,signalprocessing,so for a stable system then the region of convergence of the system function must include the unit circle in the z plane , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,127,0,0,1485.450,75,76,signalprocessing,in particular if we are mapping a continuous time filter with let's say a desired or desirable frequency response to a discrete time filter and we would like to preserve the good qualities of that frequency response as we look at the discrete time frequency response then it's important what happens in the s plane for the continuous time filter along the j omega axis relate in a nice way to what happens in the z plane around the unit circle because it's this over here that represents the frequency response in continuous time and this contour over here that represents the frequency response in discrete time , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,146,0,0,1741.390,18,19,signalprocessing,now we'll see shortly what this mapping actually means more specifically in relating the s plane to the z plane , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,150,0,0,1787.800,24,25,signalprocessing,let's just take a look at what those mappings correspond to when we look at this specifically in the s plane and in the z plane , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,152,0,0,1810.350,15,16,signalprocessing,it's the j omega axis the tells us about the frequency response and in the z plane it's the unit circle that tells us about the frequency response , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,154,0,0,1830.170,8,9,signalprocessing,now the mapping from s plane to the z plane corresponding to replacing derivatives by backward differences in fact can be shown to correspond to mapping the j omega axis not to the unit circle but to the little circle that i show here which is inside the unit circle , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,162,0,0,1896.000,9,10,signalprocessing,then where they're likely to end up in the z plane is inside the unit circle of course , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,166,0,0,1953.870,43,44,signalprocessing,let me just quickly mention and you'll have a chance to look at this a little more carefully in the video course manual that for forward differences instead of backward differences this contour in the s plane maps to a line in the z plane which is a line tangent to the unit circle and in fact is the line that i showed there , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,113,0,0,1365.360,32,33,signalprocessing,we would then expand that out in a partial fraction expansion and then apply the impulse invariant procedure which consists of mapping the poles in the s plane to poles in the z plane at locations e to the s of k capital t capital t is equal to one , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,137,0,0,1690.270,23,24,signalprocessing,and if we think more generally of the mapping represented by the bilinear transformation in the context of the s plane and the z plane it corresponds to mapping the j omega axis in the s plane to once around the unit circle in the z plane , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,141,0,0,1734.990,11,12,signalprocessing,what's happened is that we've replaced s by a function of z and it corresponds to mapping the s plane to the z plane ]

Concept = M5
Keyword = [Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,297,0,0,2999.950,9,9,signalprocessing,and then beyond that the concepts of filtering and modulation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,46,0,0,493.030,19,19,signalprocessing,and we'll see this frequency shifting property surface in a slightly different way shortly when we talk about the modulation property in the discrete time case , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,54,0,0,580.140,24,24,signalprocessing,two additional properties that will play important roles in discrete time just as they did in continuous time are the convolution property and the modulation property , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,172,0,0,1817.200,25,25,signalprocessing,now in addition to the convolution property another important property that we had in continuous time and that we have in discrete time is the modulation property , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,173,0,0,1831.500,1,1,signalprocessing,the modulation property tells us what happens in the frequency domain when you multiply signals in the time domain , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,174,0,0,1841.700,4,4,signalprocessing,in continuous time the modulation property corresponded to the statement that if we multiply the time domain we convolve the fourier transforms in the frequency domain , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,181,0,0,1928.570,10,10,signalprocessing,well let's take a look at an example of the modulation property which will then lead to one particular application and a very useful application of the modulation property in discrete time , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,185,0,0,1983.200,3,3,signalprocessing,in applying the modulation property of course what we need to do is develop the fourier transform of this signal , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,230,0,0,2438.250,10,10,signalprocessing,and we can interpret that in the context of the modulation property , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,234,0,0,2485.490,2,2,signalprocessing,and this modulation by minus one to the n will take the frequency response of this system and shift it by pi so that what's going on here at low frequencies will now go on here at high frequencies , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,236,0,0,2524.650,18,18,signalprocessing,since this ideal highpass filter is this ideal lowpass filter with the frequency response shifted by pi the modulation property tells us that in the time domain what that corresponds to is an impulse response multiplied by minus one to the n , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,238,0,0,2563.780,5,5,signalprocessing,that all follows from the modulation property , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,240,0,0,2571.710,1,1,signalprocessing,that modulation can be used to implement or convert from lowpass filtering to highpass filtering , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,241,0,0,2580.710,1,1,signalprocessing,the modulation property tells us about multiplying the time domain is shifting in the frequency domain , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,250,0,0,2660.120,16,16,signalprocessing,down below i indicate taking the input and first interchanging the high and low frequencies through modulation with minus one to the n , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,311,0,0,3295.000,32,32,signalprocessing,also as we've talked about the fourier transform both continuous time and discrete time two important properties that we focused on among many of the properties are the convolution property and the modulation property , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,313,0,0,3319.020,1,1,signalprocessing,the modulation property leads to an important concept namely modulation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,315,0,0,3335.000,16,16,signalprocessing,in the next several lectures we'll focus in more specifically first on filtering and then on modulation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,316,0,0,3342.570,7,7,signalprocessing,and as we'll see the filtering and modulation concepts form really the cornerstone of many many signal processing ideas , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,4,0,0,64.050,12,12,signalprocessing,two particularly significant ones as i mentioned at the time are the modulation property and the convolution property , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,5,0,0,72.860,21,21,signalprocessing,starting with the next lecture the one after this one we'll be developing and exploiting some of the consequences of the modulation property , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,272,0,0,2479.180,14,14,signalprocessing,and in particular beginning with the next lecture we'll turn to a discussion of modulation exploiting the property of modulation as it relates to some practical problems , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,273,0,0,2495.340,28,28,signalprocessing,and what we'll find when we do that is that a very important part of that discussion and in fact a very important part of the use of modulation also just naturally incorporates the concept and properties of filtering , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,3,0,0,56.140,11,11,signalprocessing,in this lecture we begin a discussion of the topic of modulation which is among other things a very important topic in practical terms , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,4,0,0,66.160,8,9,signalprocessing,for example it forms the cornerstone for many communication systems , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,5,0,0,72.280,14,14,signalprocessing,and also as we'll see as these lectures go along a particular form of modulation referred to as pulse amplitude modulation and eventually impulse modulation or impulse train modulation forms a very important bridge between continuous time signals and discrete time signals , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,93.670,11,11,signalprocessing,now in general terms what we mean when we refer to modulation is the notion of using one signal to vary a parameter of another signal , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,0,0,124.730,19,19,signalprocessing,and what that leads to is a notion which we'll develop in some detail referred to as sinusoidal amplitude modulation and would correspond to a sinusoidal signal referred to as the carrier and it's amplitude being varied on the basis of another signal , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,12,0,0,161.850,6,6,signalprocessing,which is referred to sinusoidal frequency modulation where essentially it's the frequency of a sinusoid that's changing depending on the signal that's we're using to modulate the sinusoid , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,13,0,0,179.460,6,6,signalprocessing,now sinusoidal amplitude frequency and phase modulation are extremely important topics and ideas in the context of communication systems , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,21,0,0,273.570,7,7,signalprocessing,and then extracting the envelope or frequency modulation information to get back to the voice signal or other information carrying signal , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,22,0,0,284.630,11,11,signalprocessing,so that's one of the very important ways in which sinusoidal modulation is used in communication systems , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,23,0,0,294.670,16,16,signalprocessing,and what we'll see in particular as we go through today's lecture is that sinusoidal amplitude modulation follows in a fairly straightforward way from the properties of the fourier transform that we've developed in some of the earlier lectures , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,24,0,0,316.920,11,11,signalprocessing,so our focus in today's lecture will be on sinusoidal amplitude modulation in continuous time , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,25,0,0,326.580,24,24,signalprocessing,in the next lecture we'll consider the same set of notions related to discrete time and also a concept referred to as pulse amplitude modulation , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,26,0,0,336.040,12,12,signalprocessing,and all of these follow in a very straightforward way from the modulation property for the fourier transform , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,27,0,0,343.470,5,5,signalprocessing,issues of frequency and phase modulation are a little more difficult to analyze , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,28,0,0,348.760,20,20,signalprocessing,but many of the techniques that we've developed in the previous lectures also provide important insights into frequency and phase modulation , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,30,0,0,364.060,15,15,signalprocessing,so what i'd like to do is focus for now on the concept of amplitude modulation , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,31,0,0,372.520,14,14,signalprocessing,and as i indicated there are several kinds of carrier signals on which the modulation can be superimposed , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,32,0,0,383.460,6,6,signalprocessing,the basic structure for an amplitude modulation system is one in which there is the modulating signal let's say for example voice and a carrier signal what's referred to as the carrier , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,33,0,0,396.560,9,10,signalprocessing,and then of course the resulting output is the modulated output , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,34,0,0,401.640,26,26,signalprocessing,now to analyze this since we have multiplication in the time domain we know from the property of the fourier transform that we've developed previously the modulation property that multiplication in the time domain corresponds to convolution in the frequency domain , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,35,0,0,420.550,20,20,signalprocessing,and it's this basic property or equation that lets us analyze in some detail in fact the notions of amplitude modulation , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,38,0,0,444.910,12,12,signalprocessing,and that leads to among other things the concept of pulse amplitude modulation , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,43,0,0,484.900,8,8,signalprocessing,so let's first begin the discussion of amplitude modulation by considering a complex exponential carrier and then moving on to a discussion of a sinusoidal carrier , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,46,0,0,509.060,2,3,signalprocessing,and the carrier that we're considering is a carrier signal c of t of the form e to the j omega c t plus theta sub c , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,47,0,0,522.030,5,6,signalprocessing,that's the form of our carrier signal , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,48,0,0,525.430,19,19,signalprocessing,and what we can first analyze is what the resulting signal or spectrum is at the output of the modulator , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,49,0,0,535.870,9,9,signalprocessing,well we can do that by concentrating on the modulation property , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,51,0,0,546.820,13,14,signalprocessing,what i've indicated here for the fourier transform of the input signal or modulating signal x of omega , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,53,0,0,565.760,3,4,signalprocessing,and then the carrier signal since it's a single complex exponential has a fourier transform which is an impulse in the frequency domain , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,64,0,0,665.210,23,23,signalprocessing,particularly in the context of this specific carrier if we look back at the top equation we have as the result of the modulation x of t times c of t where c of t is this , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,65,0,0,679.470,10,10,signalprocessing,and we could consider for example just simply dividing the modulator output by this , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,66,0,0,686.530,4,5,signalprocessing,or equivalently taking the modulated output and multiplying by e to the minus j omega c t plus theta c , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,68,0,0,700.790,10,10,signalprocessing,we have again the spectrum of the output of the modulator which is the original spectrum shifted up to the carrier frequency , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,84,0,0,811.970,5,5,signalprocessing,let's look again at the modulator which we have here , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,100,0,0,931.290,8,8,signalprocessing,and so with the output of the cosine modulator we have a spectrum that looks like this , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,106,0,0,983.540,8,8,signalprocessing,now there are lots of applications of amplitude modulation , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,110,0,0,1009.540,7,7,signalprocessing,and that is the notion of using modulation to permit the application of a very well designed and implemented low pass filter to be used as a band pass filter and in fact as a set of band pass filters , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,129,0,0,1183.860,34,34,signalprocessing,so in terms of tracking through the spectrum and looking at the equivalent filtering operation then what we accomplished was to pull out this part of the spectrum using a low pass filter and modulation , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,140,0,0,1297.660,27,27,signalprocessing,and so the idea here which is really the basis for many spectrum analyzers is to build a really good quality low pass filter and then use modulation which is often easier to implement , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,141,0,0,1311.260,1,1,signalprocessing,use modulation to shift the signal essentially in front of the filter , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,142,0,0,1320.600,6,6,signalprocessing,so we've worked our way through modulation with a complex exponential carrier , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,144,0,0,1343.260,2,2,signalprocessing,one being modulation with a cosine and the other modulation with a sine , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,146,0,0,1354.340,0,0,signalprocessing,modulation of the complex exponential carrier really would be accomplished with modulation with a sinusoidal carrier and in particular with sinusoidal carriers that are in quadrature as it's referred to or equivalently ninety degrees out of phase , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,147,0,0,1374.170,4,4,signalprocessing,well in fact sinusoidal modulation in other words , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,148,0,0,1380.750,0,0,signalprocessing,modulation using only a sinusoidal carrier very often is used in its own right not only for generating a complex exponential carrier but as a carrier by itself , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,149,0,0,1397.060,7,7,signalprocessing,let's look at what the consequences of modulation with a sinusoidal carrier are , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,151,0,0,1412.410,6,7,signalprocessing,so we are talking about a carrier signal which is simply a sinusoidal signal with some phase , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,153,0,0,1431.460,7,7,signalprocessing,and so now when we apply the modulation property we have the original spectrum which i show here x of omega , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,160,0,0,1475.340,7,7,signalprocessing,and so now when we apply the modulation property what we will do is convolve this spectrum with this spectrum and the result is that the spectrum of the original signal gets replicated at both omega sub c and at minus omega sub c , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,161,0,0,1497.460,9,9,signalprocessing,and the resulting spectrum at the output of the modulator then is the spectrum that i show here , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,170,0,0,1576.940,13,14,signalprocessing,and we now want to convolve that again with the spectrum of the carrier signal , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,171,0,0,1583.470,4,5,signalprocessing,the spectrum of the carrier signal i indicate here , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,189,0,0,1698.150,6,6,signalprocessing,so what we have is the modulator and demodulator , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,190,0,0,1703.140,19,19,signalprocessing,and just to summarize for the case of a sinusoidal carrier as opposed to a complex exponential carrier the modulator is just as it is in the complex exponential case , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,192,0,0,1731.680,15,16,signalprocessing,in the demodulator we would take the modulated signal modulate it again with the same carrier signal and as we'll see later it's important to keep the same phase relationship , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,194,0,0,1751.870,34,34,signalprocessing,we need to process that with a low pass filter that extracts the part of the spectrum around dc and throws away the upper part of the spectrum that gets generated in the second modulation process , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,204,0,0,1823.440,41,41,signalprocessing,also as i alluded to is the notion that you can take lots of signals and transmit them simultaneously over one channel whether the channel is a wire a microwave link a satellite link or whatever again using the idea of modulation , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,219,0,0,1984.380,10,12,signalprocessing,and as i've described it here it's referred to as frequency division multiplexing , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,225,0,0,2032.340,2,2,signalprocessing,and the demodulation of course involves multiplying by the carrier and doing appropriate low pass filtering to finally get the signal back , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,226,0,0,2043.510,1,3,signalprocessing,and frequency division multiplexing is the type of multiplexing that's used for example in typical broadcast am radio systems where all the channels are superimposed together , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,228,0,0,2069.760,10,10,signalprocessing,and of course you can see that not only is modulation an important part of that but as i alluded to in the last lecture filtering also becomes important part of these practical systems , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,229,0,0,2086.020,5,5,signalprocessing,now the kind of amplitude modulation that i've talked about so far is what's referred to as synchronous modulation , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,231,0,0,2112.550,11,11,signalprocessing,in particular in the system as we've talked about it the modulator and the demodulator have a synchronization in both frequency and phase , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,233,0,0,2133.630,8,8,signalprocessing,and if we take a look at the demodulator the demodulator has phase of theta sub c , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,234,0,0,2144.980,15,15,signalprocessing,and in general there's the issue of whether we can maintain that synchronization between the modulator and demodulator , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,235,0,0,2154.830,30,30,signalprocessing,and so what we want to examine now more generally is what the consequence might be and the solution to the resulting problems if we don't have synchronization between the modulator and demodulator , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,240,0,0,2191.920,15,15,signalprocessing,so now what we want to look at is what happens if we have a modulator with phase theta sub c and a demodulator where the phase instead of being theta sub c is some other phase phi sub c , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,246,0,0,2245.000,12,12,signalprocessing,one is notice for example that if the phase difference between the modulator and demodulator is ninety degrees then the output of the demodulator is zero , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,249,0,0,2269.120,22,22,signalprocessing,now even worse is the issue that if there's a phase difference but the exact phase difference isn't maintained so that the modulator and demodulator kind of fade in and out of phase then the output of the demodulator is x of t multiplied by a time varying fading term which is the cosine of the phase difference , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,250,0,0,2297.500,17,17,signalprocessing,well what that means essentially is that if you use this kind of system to do the demodulation then what you need to be careful about is maintaining synchronization in phase and also in frequency between the modulator and the demodulator , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,252,0,0,2324.200,9,9,signalprocessing,and the alternative is what's referred to as asynchronous demodulation , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,253,0,0,2330.420,9,9,signalprocessing,and let me indicate what the idea behind asynchronous demodulation is , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,254,0,0,2337.760,8,8,signalprocessing,now recall that what we've done in amplitude modulation is to take the carrier signal and vary its amplitude with the signal that eventually we want to get back , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,263,0,0,2407.150,7,7,signalprocessing,and then that is a type of demodulation , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,264,0,0,2413.090,2,2,signalprocessing,it's a demodulation that doesn't require synchronization between the modulator and demodulator , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,270,0,0,2459.090,12,12,signalprocessing,what might we see as we look at the output of the demodulator , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,271,0,0,2464.590,5,5,signalprocessing,well the output of the demodulator would follow the envelope down and then it would follow the envelope back up again , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,274,0,0,2484.970,13,14,signalprocessing,the simple solution is to make sure that the signal that is the modulating signal x of t never goes negative , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,279,0,0,2509.840,10,10,signalprocessing,what we want to do then if we're considering asynchronous demodulation is to take our original signal x of t and add to it a constant where the constant is made large enough so that we're sure that this is a positive signal , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,280,0,0,2533.300,19,20,signalprocessing,and incidentally let me just draw your attention to the fact that i'm now suppressing the phase on the carrier signal since the phase is not important to the argument and it's just some additional notation to carry around , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,284,0,0,2576.090,21,21,signalprocessing,onto the carrier omega sub c t and also injecting some carrier with an amplitude a and the output of the modulator is then the sum of those two , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,294,0,0,2662.620,9,9,signalprocessing,here is the spectrum at the output of the modulator , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,301,0,0,2709.900,10,10,signalprocessing,it's simply the injection of a carrier to make the demodulation for an asynchronous demodulator to make the demodulation easier , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,303,0,0,2725.340,17,17,signalprocessing,and in fact one represents the tradeoff and the associated parameters very often in terms of percent modulation where the percent modulation is essentially the ratio of the maximum signal level to the amplitude of the injected carrier , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,304,0,0,2747.380,-1,-1,signalprocessing,and depending on whether the modulation's very high or very low the tradeoff is that the transmission is more inefficient and it takes more energy but the demodulator is simpler , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,305,0,0,2761.190,2,2,signalprocessing,or the demodulator is more complicated but the transmission is simpler , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,309,0,0,2797.010,11,11,signalprocessing,and so in one case satellite communication you would use synchronous modulation and demodulation , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,310,0,0,2803.890,23,23,signalprocessing,whereas in typical consumer oriented broadcasting you would use an asynchronous system and transmit more power even if it's inefficient so that the demodulator can be simpler , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,313,0,0,2831.900,13,13,signalprocessing,there also is a somewhat different issue related to inefficiency in sinusoidal amplitude modulation , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,318,0,0,2865.960,5,5,signalprocessing,and in a sinusoidal amplitude modulation system we would center it around plus and minus the carrier frequency , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,345,0,0,3082.180,18,18,signalprocessing,it's clearly more efficient than double sideband transmission but also has the complication or additional issue that the modulator becomes a little more complicated because you need this filtering operation or some equivalent operation to get rid of the unwanted sideband , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,346,0,0,3106.730,14,14,signalprocessing,well this is a fairly quick tour through a variety of issues related to modulation , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,348,0,0,3118.180,0,0,signalprocessing,modulation in the context of sinusoidal modulation as we've talked about has a lot of detailed issues associated with it , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,349,0,0,3129.030,30,30,signalprocessing,it's important to recognize and to be somewhat pleased by the fact that not only with the mathematical foundations that we've developed can we understand the basics of sinusoidal amplitude modulation , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,352,0,0,3185.000,23,23,signalprocessing,and as we'll see the next lecture very much the same kinds of notions apply for discrete time sinusoidal and complex exponential amplitude modulation , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,353,0,0,3199.000,25,25,signalprocessing,and also as i indicated at the beginning of the lecture in the next lecture we'll also talk about what's referred to as pulse amplitude modulation , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,96.510,14,14,signalprocessing,over to the right is a device that will allow us to study amplitude modulation and the various flavors of it , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,22,1,0,158.550,10,10,signalprocessing,and we'll be using that actually when we demonstrate amplitude modulation , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,88,1,0,463.560,4,4,signalprocessing,it corresponds to frequency modulation where sandy is now the modulating signal , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,90,1,0,469.910,10,10,signalprocessing,and we won't really be going into issues of frequency modulation in any more detail in this demonstration , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,201,1,0,1202.040,17,17,signalprocessing,and now what we'd like to focus on is the modulator and talk a little bit about modulation and demodulation and demonstrate it , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,202,1,0,1213.800,15,15,signalprocessing,and let's begin that by first taking a look at a block diagram of the modulator system , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,203,1,0,1224.170,9,9,signalprocessing,well as we've discussed in a previous lecture amplitude modulation basically consists of multiplying the modulating signal by an appropriate carrier illustrated here as we've seen previously for the case of a sinusoidal carrier , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,204,1,0,1241.870,6,6,signalprocessing,and then specifically for sinusoidal amplitude modulation we may or may not inject some carrier signal , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,206,1,0,1253.660,28,29,signalprocessing,or equivalently if we look at the modulated output the injection of the carrier is equivalent mathematically to simply adding a dc offset or a constant to the modulating signal , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,207,1,0,1269.250,33,33,signalprocessing,and as you recall when we talked about this the idea of injecting a carrier or not is related to the issue of whether or not we want to do synchronous or asynchronous demodulation , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,208,1,0,1284.290,2,2,signalprocessing,the asynchronous demodulation corresponding to the simple use of an envelope detector , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,212,1,0,1310.170,13,13,signalprocessing,and this in fact corresponds to what we refer to as fifty percents modulation and this is the case of one hundred percents modulation , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,215,1,0,1337.820,2,3,signalprocessing,specifically the modulating signal is multiplied by the carrier , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,217,1,0,1354.430,10,10,signalprocessing,and so the modulated output can have a variable percent modulation the percent modulation being changed depending on how we set this variable gain , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,218,1,0,1366.690,5,5,signalprocessing,now in addition to sinusoidal modulation , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,226,1,0,1422.100,18,18,signalprocessing,well sandy maybe to begin you can just point out what some of the controls are on the modulator box , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,236,0,0,1467.310,17,18,signalprocessing,and then farther over to the left there are some knobs for changing the frequency of the carrier signal , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,237,1,0,1473.440,29,30,signalprocessing,ok let me also just point out again for emphasis that changing the carrier level as we've talked about is mathematically equivalent to changing the dc level of the modulating signal , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,238,1,0,1485.990,7,7,signalprocessing,and that's also what affects the percent modulation as we had just discussed , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,239,1,0,1491.320,9,10,signalprocessing,now what we have set up is a sinusoidal modulating signal and a sinusoidal little carrier , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,243,1,0,1511.870,4,5,signalprocessing,and this is the carrier signal , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,245,1,0,1516.620,13,14,signalprocessing,and these side bands then correspond to the side bands associated with the modulating signal , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,246,1,0,1523.270,8,9,signalprocessing,so this is the spectrum of the total modulated output right , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,251,0,0,1539.010,11,12,signalprocessing,and again it's a little hard to sink in both the modulating signal and the carrier so you see the carrier kind of wondering by but there it is , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,252,0,0,1547.630,11,12,signalprocessing,another thing that can be varied is the amplitude of the modulating signal , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,256,0,0,1566.560,8,9,signalprocessing,i'll go back first to a square wave modulating signal which is again you can see the square wave on top and one on the bottom , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,260,0,0,1579.330,10,10,signalprocessing,those are the side bands due to the square wave modulation , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,264,0,0,1594.890,11,12,signalprocessing,and you'll notice that the side bands wander away from the carrier signal in the spectrum , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,265,0,0,1600.230,3,4,signalprocessing,the spectrum the carrier signal of that doesn't have a frequency that's changing as i do this , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,266,0,0,1606.040,10,11,signalprocessing,it's just the width of the band due to the modulating signal , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,275,1,0,1644.790,14,15,signalprocessing,and we had talked about or sandy had indicated that we can change the carrier signal shape , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,276,1,0,1653.210,5,6,signalprocessing,and let me change the carrier signal from a sine wave to a square wave , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,278,1,0,1667.680,7,8,signalprocessing,and what you see now is the modulating signal showing up around harmonics associated with the carrier , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,280,0,0,1684.630,6,6,signalprocessing,this is actually called a ring modulator , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,283,0,0,1691.220,5,6,signalprocessing,and so a square wave carrier signal is very convenient to generate , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,287,1,0,1711.190,6,6,signalprocessing,and let's do that on the modulator box , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,288,1,0,1713.870,12,13,signalprocessing,we could do that either by changing a dc offset on the modulating signal or by changing the amount of carrier that's injected , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,292,1,0,1738.320,17,17,signalprocessing,we bring the carrier back up and when we do that then we are reducing the percent modulation and simultaneously obviously related to that is changing the carrier level , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,293,1,0,1755.420,40,40,signalprocessing,now i had indicated in previous lectures that reducing the carrier is efficient in terms of power transmission but requires a synchronous demodulator whereas if there's carrier injected as we have here so that we're not over modulating the percent modulation is less than one hundred then because of the shape of the time wave form as you can see here you can do the demodulation with a more or less simple envelope detector , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,295,1,0,1801.560,11,11,signalprocessing,and so here the power transmitted required is higher but the demodulator based on using an envelope detector is considerably simpler , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,296,1,0,1815.150,12,12,signalprocessing,well speaking of am radios what we'd like to now demonstrate is modulation and demodulation with an am radio which sandy happens to have here , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,309,1,0,1875.350,7,7,signalprocessing,and the way that it does the demodulation is not exactly the way we've talked about it in the lectures , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,337,0,0,1998.710,15,15,signalprocessing,what we're going to do then is use the audio oscillator along with the amplitude modulator , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,3,0,0,55.940,9,9,signalprocessing,in the last lecture we began the discussion of modulation , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,5,0,0,65.710,6,6,signalprocessing,and in talking about continuous time modulation we've covered a number of topics , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,69.950,8,8,signalprocessing,we talked about the properties and analysis of modulation when we had a complex exponential carrier signal , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,0,0,86.130,16,16,signalprocessing,and in that context and related to the application associated with communications we talked about synchronous modulation asynchronous modulation and also the notion of single side band modulation , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,111.920,13,13,signalprocessing,one is a parallel discussion particularly as associated with complex exponential and sinusoidal modulation for discrete time signals , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,123.260,29,29,signalprocessing,and the second is the introduction and analysis of another kind of carriers specifically a pulse kind of carrier in continuous time leading to the notions of pulse amplitude modulation and eventually a very powerful theorem and result called the sampling theorem , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,12,0,0,142.990,12,12,signalprocessing,well let me begin the lecture though focusing on the discrete time modulation to essentially draw your attention to the fact that the analysis in discrete time very much parallels the analysis in continuous time , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,13,0,0,160.200,19,20,signalprocessing,well let's consider in the discrete time case just as we had in continuous time a signal modulating a carrier signal and the resulting modulated signal is y of n , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,14,0,0,176.170,7,7,signalprocessing,and it was in continuous time the modulation property associated with the fourier transform that provided the basis for the analysis , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,16,0,0,192.120,10,10,signalprocessing,in particular what we have in discrete time is the modulation property as it relates to the fourier transform which tells us that the fourier transform of the modulated signal is the convolution of the fourier transform of the carrier and the fourier transform of the modulated signal , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,24,0,0,286.170,6,6,signalprocessing,well we have once again the modulation property , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,25,0,0,290.740,2,2,signalprocessing,and the modulation property tells us that the spectrum of the modulated signal is the periodic convolution of the two spectra , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,30,0,0,343.320,3,4,signalprocessing,the spectra the carrier signal if this is the carrier then it's spectrum is an impulse train and that impulse train i've indicated here , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,32,0,0,366.500,8,9,signalprocessing,so this then is the spectrum of the carrier signal , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,36,0,0,388.170,4,4,signalprocessing,so the result of modulation with a complex exponential is a straightforward shift of the spectrum so that what occurred around zero frequency now occurs around the frequency omega sub c , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,47,0,0,517.460,8,9,signalprocessing,so in this case now rather than a carrier signal which is a single complex exponential it's now a sinusoidal carrier and the sinusoidal carrier is the sum of two complex exponential , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,53,0,0,632.080,16,16,signalprocessing,in particular let's consider demodulating by taking the modulated signal and again putting that through a modulator again with the carrier which is cosine omega sub cn , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,54,0,0,645.690,7,7,signalprocessing,if we do that we have a demodulator or what will turn out to be part of a demodulator as i indicate here the spectrum of the input signal is as i had just developed a replication of the original spectrum around plus and minus omega sub c with an amplitude of a half , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,59,0,0,740.350,3,3,signalprocessing,we have sinusoidal modulation which consists of using a sinusoidal carrier , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,60,0,0,748.010,4,4,signalprocessing,and we have the demodulator which consists of taking a modulated signal multiplying by the carrier and then processing that with a low pass filter to extract the portion of the spectrum which is around zero frequency as i indicate in the spectrum below and the result then that this low pass filter having a gain of two is that we've recovered the original spectrum x of omega which is the spectrum that we started with , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,62,0,0,792.060,8,8,signalprocessing,this is a fairly quick tour through sinusoidal modulation for discrete time , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,63,0,0,799.000,23,23,signalprocessing,there are very similar issues that arise in the discrete time case in terms of having phase synchronization and frequency synchronization between the modulator and demodulator , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,65,0,0,816.900,28,28,signalprocessing,in some sense in practical terms that becomes much more of an issue in continuous time than it does in discrete time in part because synchronization between a modulator and demodulator is often much harder in a continuous time system which is essentially an analog system as compared with a digital system , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,66,0,0,843.490,26,26,signalprocessing,another very important reason and it's important to stress this at the outset is that whereas the theory involving the use of complex exponential and sinusoidal modulation parallels very strongly in the continuous time and the discrete time case , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,68,0,0,868.810,6,6,signalprocessing,that is the notion called sinusidal modulation in the context of communication systems is extremely important for continuous time systems and less so in discrete time systems , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,69,0,0,882.720,28,28,signalprocessing,now as a preview of a point to be raised later on i should modify that slightly with the statement that one very important place in which sinusoidal modulation in a discrete time context arises is in a class of systems called transmultiplexers or transmodulation systems , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,70,0,0,906.410,8,9,signalprocessing,and this surface is basically because so many communication systems are now becoming digital and specifically discrete time although the actual transmission is continuous time the signal processing manipulation and switching is discrete time , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,71,0,0,925.080,40,40,signalprocessing,and so in fact it turns out to be very important and useful to take a discrete time representation of the analog signals or continuous time signals and in a discrete time or digital representation to convert them from one modulation scheme or one multiplexing scheme to another , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,72,0,0,948.070,28,28,signalprocessing,and although i said a lot there that really requires much more detail to develop in any sense at all you should get the notion that discrete time modulation systems become very important in part because of implementational issues , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,73,0,0,973.110,21,21,signalprocessing,ok now there is another application that we have discussed for both continuous time and actually previously for discrete time amplitude modulation with sinusoidal complex exponential carriers , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,75,0,0,996.980,7,7,signalprocessing,and that is the notion of using modulation together with fixed filtering to implement a filter which either has a variable cut off or converts let's say a low pass filter to a high pass filter , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,76,0,0,1014.580,10,10,signalprocessing,we had originally talked about this when we introduce the modulation property in the context of converting a low pass filter to a high pass filter , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,78,0,0,1048.000,3,3,signalprocessing,and if after modulation that is processed with a low pass filter and then the result is demodulated using exactly the same carrier namely a carrier which is minus one to the n then the effect of that is equivalent to high pass filtering on the original signal , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,79,0,0,1076.170,41,41,signalprocessing,and a generalization of that would involve instead of this specific choice of minus one to the n would involve a choice in general of e to the j omega sub cn that is a more general carrier frequency and a demodulator which is e to the minus j omega sub cn , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,80,0,0,1096.590,18,18,signalprocessing,and as i've represented it here and as we had talked about it when we talked about the modulation property for discrete time signals we had specifically chosen the conversion of a low pass to a high pass filter , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,81,0,0,1110.060,42,43,signalprocessing,well let me continue the review of that just by reminding you of the details of what happens with the spectra and specifically the notion if we take this particular case of omega sub c is equal to pi or equivalently a carrier signal which is minus one to the n then if we have the original spectra and the spectrum of the carrier signal the spectrum of the carrier signal convolved with this spectrum will then in effect shift this by pi , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,89,0,0,1259.130,18,18,signalprocessing,ok well so what we've done so far for continuous time and discrete time is to talk about modulation amplitude modulation with complex exponential and sinusoidal carriers , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,91,0,0,1281.190,13,14,signalprocessing,and now what i'd like to turn to is a different choice of carrier signal , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,92,0,0,1287.650,2,3,signalprocessing,and the carrier signal in this particular case is a pulse train rather than a sinusoidal signal , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,94,0,0,1302.930,17,18,signalprocessing,in general of course the modulator consists of all of multiplying x of t by whatever the carrier signal is , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,95,0,0,1312.490,6,7,signalprocessing,and previously we've talked about a carrier signal which is sinusoidal signal , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,96,0,0,1318.435,1,2,signalprocessing,the carrier signal that we want to consider now is a carrier signal which in fact is a pulse train , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,98,0,0,1347.030,29,29,signalprocessing,so what we have now is a modulated signal that is a chopped or sliced version of the original waveform and that is what's referred to as pulse amplitude modulation , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,107,0,0,1425.010,22,22,signalprocessing,first just comment very briefly that all of the analysis we go through as has been true in the case of sinusoidal modulation all of the analysis then we go through holds just as well with essentially minor analytical modifications to discrete time pulse amplitude modulation as it does to continuous time pulse amplitude modulation , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,132,0,0,1662.510,26,27,signalprocessing,we had talked last time about frequency division multiplexing where individual signals were put into individual frequencies slots by choosing different carrier frequencies for a sinusoidal modulating signal , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,138,0,0,1750.100,7,7,signalprocessing,so it's a very different very important modulation scheme called time division multiplexing in contrast to frequency division multiplexing as we had talked about last time , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,140,0,0,1764.570,7,8,signalprocessing,and in fact what happens in many communication systems is that the signals are represented in fact in discrete time , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,142,0,0,1779.750,6,8,signalprocessing,and very often the conversion from frequency division multiplexing to time division multiplexing and back is done in fact in the discrete time domain , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,148,0,0,1873.230,5,6,signalprocessing,and notice that in this modulated output spectrum the ability to recover this is totally independent called what the value of delta is , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,149,0,0,1886.880,9,9,signalprocessing,in other words if we look back at the modulator then in fact we can make delta the width of these pulses arbitrarily small , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,160,0,0,1998.900,26,27,signalprocessing,in that case as delta gets arbitrarily small then in fact what these rectangles become are impulses in which case what we're talking about is a carrier signal which in fact is an impulse train , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,167,0,0,2092.170,6,6,signalprocessing,and the resulting output of the modulator has a spectrum which is this original spectrum again replicated around each of these impulses in other words replicated in multiples of the sampling frequency now this is very much identical to the more general case , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,172,0,0,2176.430,14,14,signalprocessing,and that would be true also in a more general case of pulse amplitude modulation with pulses of non zero width , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,177,0,0,2247.050,16,16,signalprocessing,now let me stress just going back to the picture in which we had done this modulation that this process where the modulation where the carrier signal involves an impulse train is often referred to as sampling , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,185,0,0,2374.510,7,7,signalprocessing,we began this discussion by talking about modulation , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,186,0,0,2379.040,3,3,signalprocessing,and in fact modulation and sinusoidal of modulation is important in its own right , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,187,0,0,2384.410,10,10,signalprocessing,we ended the discussion by talking about first pulse amplitude modulation and then showing how under the right set of conditions you can in fact take a wave form and sample it with a set of instantaneous samples , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,7,1,0,110.350,21,21,signalprocessing,and the sampling theorem essentially was derived by observing or using the notion that sampling could be done by multiplication or modulation with an impulse train , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,1,0,123.830,11,11,signalprocessing,and the sampling theorem developed by examining the consequence of the modulation property in the context of the fourier transform , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,16,1,0,230.040,7,7,signalprocessing,it essentially says that after sampling or modulation with an impulse train the resulting spectrum is the original spectrum added to itself shifted by integer multiples of the sampling frequency , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,23,1,0,345.990,12,12,signalprocessing,the fourier transform i show here of the original signal and after modulation with the impulse train the resulting spectrum that we have is that replicated around integer multiples of the sampling frequency , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,302,1,0,2324.400,27,27,signalprocessing,and that's one of the reasons by the way that people watching this on the video course are in fact seeing a flicker or a beating or modulation between the two unsynchronized frame rates , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,15,0,0,196.170,5,5,signalprocessing,and the result of that modulation is then the sample sequence x of p of n , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,17,0,0,216.220,14,14,signalprocessing,and then we have the sampling impulse train or sampling sequence and it's the modulation or product of these two that gives us the sample sequence x of p of n , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,252,0,0,2491.140,19,19,signalprocessing,well frequency domain sampling just to kind of introduce the topic corresponds and can be analyzed in terms doing modulation in the frequency domain very much like the modulation that we carried out in the time domain for time domain sampling , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,258,0,0,2569.620,1,1,signalprocessing,it's modulation by an impulse train , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,4,0,0,56.170,9,9,signalprocessing,over the last series of lectures in discussing filtering modulation and sampling we've seen how powerful and useful the fourier transform is , Lecture25FeedbackMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,65.970,5,5,signalprocessing,for example for filtering for modulation et cetera , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,293,0,0,2894.130,16,16,signalprocessing,here's another example which in fact as we'll see later is a system which is a modulator , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,295,0,0,2906.820,33,33,signalprocessing,and although you might think at first that this system is time invariant in fact it is not because the input shifted generates an output which is the input shifted times the same modulation function , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,118,0,0,1379.350,27,27,signalprocessing,however before we do that i'd like to focus on two additional major properties and these are what i refer to as the convolution property and the modulation property , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,120,0,0,1416.700,7,7,signalprocessing,similarly what i'll refer to as the modulation property , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,186,0,0,2153.360,8,8,signalprocessing,and that is what's referred to as the modulation property , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,189,0,0,2183.140,8,8,signalprocessing,and in fact that is exactly what the modulation property is , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,193,0,0,2214.390,1,1,signalprocessing,the modulation property as i've summarized it here in fact is the entire basis for amplitude modulation systems as used almost universally in communications , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,194,0,0,2230.080,3,3,signalprocessing,and what the modulation property as we'll see when we explore it in more detail tells us is that if we have a signal with a certain spectrum and we multiply by a sinusoidal signal whose fourier transform is a set of impulses then in a frequency domain we convolve , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,264,0,0,2909.190,13,13,signalprocessing,we've seen already a glimpse of how it plays a role in filtering modulation how its properties help us with linear constant coefficient differential equations et cetera , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,267,0,0,2940.190,33,33,signalprocessing,and then after we have the continuous time and discrete time fourier transforms we'll then see how the concepts involved and the properties involved lead to very important and powerful notions of filtering modulation sampling and other signal processing ideas ]

Keyword = [Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,295,0,0,2916.510,11,12,signalprocessing,beginning in the next lecture what i will introduce is the laplace transform and beyond that the z transform , Lecture1IntroductionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,150,0,0,1597.630,27,28,signalprocessing,and in the context of the frequency domain representation some of the kinds of ideas and topics that we'll be exploring are the fourier transform and the laplace transform and a discrete time counterpart of the laplace transform which is the z transform , Lecture1IntroductionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,152,0,0,1623.990,2,3,signalprocessing,and the laplace transform and z transform represent extensions of the fourier transform and we'll be getting into that later in the course , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,90.300,17,18,signalprocessing,the generalization that we'll be talking about in the continuous time case is referred to as the laplace transform and in the discrete time case is referred to as the z transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,7,0,0,103.680,20,21,signalprocessing,what i'd like to do in today's lecture is begin on the continuous time case namely a discussion of the laplace transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,125.080,7,8,signalprocessing,now to introduce the notion of the laplace transform let me remind you again of what led us into the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,37,0,0,406.660,15,16,signalprocessing,well in fact what that integral corresponds to is what we will define as the laplace transform of the impulse response , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,39,0,0,432.370,15,16,signalprocessing,and so in general it is this transformation on a time function which is the laplace transform of that time function and it's a function of s , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,40,0,0,445.050,5,6,signalprocessing,so the definition of the laplace transform is that the laplace transform of a time function x of t is the result of this transformation on x of t , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,41,0,0,459.990,34,35,signalprocessing,it's denoted as x of s and as a shorthand notation as we had with the fourier transform then we have in the time domain the time function x of t and in the laplace transform domain the function x of s , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,47,0,0,528.020,10,11,signalprocessing,the mapping that we've ended up with is called the laplace transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,48,0,0,531.850,19,20,signalprocessing,and as you can well imagine and perhaps may have recognized already there's a very close connection between the laplace transform and the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,49,0,0,543.500,27,28,signalprocessing,well to see one of the connections what we can observe is that if we look at the fourier transform expression and if we look at the laplace transform expression where s is now a general complex number sigma plus j omega these two expressions in fact are identical if in fact sigma is equal to zero , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,52,0,0,587.530,11,12,signalprocessing,what this then tells us is that if we have the laplace transform and if we look at the laplace transform at s equals j omega then that in fact corresponds to the fourier transform of x of t , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,56,0,0,625.470,15,16,signalprocessing,notice that on the left hand side of this equation x of s representing the laplace transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,63,0,0,689.440,4,5,signalprocessing,in other words the laplace transform at s equals j omega just simply reduces both mathematically and notationally to the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,66,0,0,719.620,12,13,signalprocessing,now here we see one relationship between the fourier transform and the laplace transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,67,0,0,726.560,3,4,signalprocessing,namely that the laplace transform for s equals j omega reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,69,0,0,737.340,6,7,signalprocessing,in particular the fact that the laplace transform can be interpreted as the fourier transform of a modified version of x of t , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,73,0,0,758.225,1,2,signalprocessing,the laplace transform reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,74,0,0,762.540,8,9,signalprocessing,but now let's look at the more general laplace transform expression , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,85,0,0,845.380,12,13,signalprocessing,so we have then this additional relationship which tells us that the laplace transform is the fourier transform of an exponentially weighted time function , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,91,0,0,896.760,13,14,signalprocessing,but when we multiply it by this exponential factor that's embodied in the laplace transform in fact that brings the function back down for positive time , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,93,0,0,917.190,10,11,signalprocessing,and so the conclusion an important point is that the laplace transform the fourier transform of this product may converge even though the fourier transform of x of t doesn't , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,94,0,0,929.530,4,5,signalprocessing,in other words the laplace transform may converge even when the fourier transform doesn't converge , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,97,0,0,948.720,26,27,signalprocessing,to the fact that this equation in effect provides the basis for us to figure out how to express x of t in terms of the laplace transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,101,0,0,1016.160,10,11,signalprocessing,ok well let's just look at some examples of the laplace transform of some time functions , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,112,0,0,1076.620,5,6,signalprocessing,if instead we apply the laplace transform to this , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,113,0,0,1081.620,2,3,signalprocessing,applying the laplace transform is the same as taking the fourier transform of x of t times an exponential and the exponent that we would multiply by is e to the minus sigma t , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,114,0,0,1095.710,5,6,signalprocessing,so in effect taking the laplace transform of this is like taking the fourier transform of e to the minus at e to the minus sigma t , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,115,0,0,1109.860,16,17,signalprocessing,and if we carry that through just working through the integral we end up with a laplace transform which is one over s plus a , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,117,0,0,1130.980,6,7,signalprocessing,now what happens is that the laplace transform will only converge when the fourier transform of this converges , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,121,0,0,1159.510,5,6,signalprocessing,so in fact in the laplace transform of this we have an expression one over s plus a , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,125,0,0,1196.580,14,15,signalprocessing,and so for this example we can summarize it as this exponential has a laplace transform which is one over s plus a where s is restricted to the range the real part of s greater than minus a , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,128,0,0,1223.880,2,3,signalprocessing,with the laplace transform there are certain values of s , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,130,0,0,1236.360,7,8,signalprocessing,the values of s for which the laplace transform converges is the values are referred to as the region of convergence of the laplace transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,131,0,0,1250.580,9,10,signalprocessing,and it's important to recognize that in specifying the laplace transform what's required is not only the algebraic expression but also the domain or set of values of s for which that algebraic expression is valid , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,134,0,0,1290.040,13,14,signalprocessing,and if you carry through the algebra there you end up with a laplace transform expression which is again one over s plus a , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,143,0,0,1364.280,14,15,signalprocessing,now later on in this lecture and actually also as the discussion of the laplace transform goes on we'll begin to see and understand more about how the region of convergence relates to various properties of the time function , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,146,0,0,1398.620,10,11,signalprocessing,and although we haven't formally talked about properties of the laplace transform yet one of the properties that we'll see and it's relatively easy to develop is the fact that the laplace transform of a sum is the sum of the laplace transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,147,0,0,1413.430,7,8,signalprocessing,so in fact we can get the laplace transform of the sum of these two terms as the sum of the laplace transforms , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,149,0,0,1441.180,6,7,signalprocessing,for this one we have a laplace transform which is one over s plus two with a region of convergence which is the real part of s greater than minus two , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,166,0,0,1584.190,6,7,signalprocessing,well this particular example has the laplace transform as a rational function , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,175,0,0,1642.760,14,15,signalprocessing,the roots of the numerator polynomial are referred to as the zeroes of the laplace transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,177,0,0,1656.790,15,16,signalprocessing,and the roots of the denominator polynomial are referred to as the poles of the laplace transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,178,0,0,1664.900,10,11,signalprocessing,and those are the values of s at which the laplace transform blows up , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,182,0,0,1689.360,18,19,signalprocessing,what we would expect is that wherever that happens there must be some problem with convergence of the laplace transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,183,0,0,1695.930,3,4,signalprocessing,and indeed the laplace transform doesn't converge at the poles , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,186,0,0,1708.120,11,12,signalprocessing,let's examine and talk about the region of convergence of the laplace transform and how it's associated both with properties of the time function and also with the location of the poles of the laplace transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,194,0,0,1786.160,45,46,signalprocessing,and one for example is the statement that if i have a point in the s plane that corresponds to convergence then in fact any line in the s plane with that same real part will also be a set of values for which the laplace transform converges , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,196,0,0,1809.450,16,17,signalprocessing,the reason for that is that s is sigma plus j omega and convergence of the laplace transform is associated with convergence of the fourier transform of e to the minus sigma t times x of t , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,204,0,0,1877.980,7,8,signalprocessing,in particular since we know that the laplace transform reduces to the fourier transform when the complex variable s is equal to j omega the implication is that if we have the laplace transform and if the laplace transform reduces to the fourier transform when sigma equals zero , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,205,0,0,1904.440,26,27,signalprocessing,in other words when s is equal to j omega then the fourier transform of x of t converging is equivalent to the statement that the laplace transform converges for sigma equal to zero , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,211,0,0,1945.240,10,11,signalprocessing,and that is that the region of convergence of the laplace transform is a connected region , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,214,0,0,1970.420,6,7,signalprocessing,let's suppose that i have a laplace transform and the laplace transform that i'm talking about is a rational function which is one over s plus one times s plus two , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,231,0,0,2111.250,7,8,signalprocessing,associate the region of convergence of the laplace transform with some very specific characteristics of the time function , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,239,0,0,2181.040,16,17,signalprocessing,and now the question is what can we say about the region of convergence of the laplace transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,240,0,0,2189.770,2,3,signalprocessing,well the laplace transform is the fourier transform of the time function multiplied by an exponential , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,263,0,0,2425.420,33,34,signalprocessing,in particular we can make the statement that if the time function is right sided and if convergence occurs for some value sigma zero then in fact we will have convergence of the laplace transform for all values of the real part of s greater than sigma zero , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,267,0,0,2493.190,25,26,signalprocessing,if you put those two statements together then we end up with a statement that if x of t is right sided and if its laplace transform is rational then the region of convergence is to the right of the rightmost pole , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,278,0,0,2612.500,27,28,signalprocessing,now similar to the statement that we made for right sided signals if x of t is left sided and in fact we're talking about a rational laplace transform which we most typically will , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,292,0,0,2746.040,5,6,signalprocessing,well if we have a laplace transform we can in principle get the time function back again by recognizing this relationship between the laplace transform and the fourier transform and using the formal fourier transform expression , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,293,0,0,2760.650,5,6,signalprocessing,or equivalently the formal inverse laplace transform expression which is in the text , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,294,0,0,2767.190,21,22,signalprocessing,but more typically what we would do is what we've done also with the fourier transform which is to use simple laplace transform pairs together with the notion of the partial fraction expansion , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,296,0,0,2788.020,6,7,signalprocessing,let's suppose that i have a laplace transform as i indicated here in its pole zero plot and a region of convergence which is to the right of this pole , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,305,0,0,2861.960,24,25,signalprocessing,recognizing that this is to the right of the poles that tells us immediately that each of these two then would correspond to the laplace transform of a right sided time function , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,312,0,0,2909.370,29,30,signalprocessing,if you think back to that example or refer to your notes we know that time function of the form e to the minus a t gives us the laplace transform which is one over s plus a with the real part of s greater than minus a , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,313,0,0,2927.530,5,6,signalprocessing,and so this is the laplace transform of the first , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,314,0,0,2930.620,7,8,signalprocessing,or i'm sorry this is the inverse laplace transform of the first term , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,320,0,0,2983.210,27,28,signalprocessing,and if we simply put the two terms together then adding the one that we have here to what we had before we have a total inverse laplace transform which is that , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,337,0,0,3144.950,13,14,signalprocessing,ok well what we've gone through rather quickly is an introduction to the laplace transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,338,0,0,3152.510,13,14,signalprocessing,and a couple of points to underscore again is the fact that the laplace transform is very closely associated with the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,339,0,0,3162.690,4,5,signalprocessing,and in fact the laplace transform for s equals j omega reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,340,0,0,3169.570,4,5,signalprocessing,but more generally the laplace transform is the fourier transform of x of t with an exponential weighting , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,343,0,0,3190.780,8,9,signalprocessing,that then imposes on the discussion of the laplace transform what we refer to as the region of convergence , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,344,0,0,3198.860,10,11,signalprocessing,and it's very important to understand that in specifying a laplace transform it's important to identify not only the algebraic expression but also the values of s for which it's valid , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,345,0,0,3215.620,7,8,signalprocessing,namely the region of convergence of the laplace transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,346,0,0,3219.490,27,28,signalprocessing,finally what we did was to tie together some properties of a time function with things that we can say about the region of convergence of its laplace transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,347,0,0,3232.060,8,9,signalprocessing,now just as with the fourier transform the laplace transform has some very important properties , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,348,0,0,3238.670,12,13,signalprocessing,and out of these properties both are some mechanisms for using the laplace transform for such systems as those described by linear constant coefficient differential equations , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,350,0,0,3257.900,13,14,signalprocessing,as we understand them further will help us in using and exploiting the laplace transform to study and understand linear time invariant systems , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,352,0,0,3274.970,24,25,signalprocessing,in particular talking about properties and then associating with linear time invariant systems much of the discussion that we've had today relating to the laplace transform , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,4,0,0,56.490,5,6,signalprocessing,last time we introduced the laplace transform as a generalization of the fourier transform and just as a reminder the laplace transform expression as we developed it is this integral very much similar to the fourier transform integral except with a more general complex variable , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,5,0,0,79.210,12,13,signalprocessing,and in fact we developed and talked about the relationship between the laplace transform and the fourier transform , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,86.260,3,4,signalprocessing,in particular the laplace transform with the laplace transform variable s purely imaginary in fact reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,7,0,0,98.970,5,6,signalprocessing,or more generally with the laplace transform variable as a complex number the laplace transform is the fourier transform of the corresponding time function with an exponential weighting , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,0,0,115.280,14,15,signalprocessing,and also as you should recall the exponential waiting introduced the notion that the laplace transform may converge for some values of sigma and perhaps not for other values of sigma , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,0,0,130.360,4,5,signalprocessing,so associated with the laplace transform was what we refer to as the region of convergence , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,140.400,15,16,signalprocessing,now just as with the fourier transform there are a number of properties of the laplace transform that are extremely useful in describing and analyzing signals and systems , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,12,0,0,159.200,20,21,signalprocessing,took advantage of in our discussion last time was the linearly the linearity property which says in essence that the laplace transform of the linear combination of two time functions is the same linear combination of the associated laplace transforms , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,14,0,0,183.640,12,13,signalprocessing,which tells us how the derivative of a time function rather the laplace transform of the derivative is related to the laplace transform , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,15,0,0,194.710,3,4,signalprocessing,in particular the laplace transform of the derivative is the laplace transform x of t multiplied by s , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,19,0,0,225.700,7,8,signalprocessing,here the convolution property says that the laplace transform of the convolution of two time functions is the product of the associated laplace transforms , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,24,0,0,304.390,2,3,signalprocessing,in the laplace transform domain the laplace transform of the output is the laplace transform of the impulse response times the laplace transform of the input , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,27,0,0,332.430,6,7,signalprocessing,in the more general case with laplace transforms it's typical to refer to the laplace transform of the impulse response as the system function , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,34,0,0,405.710,6,7,signalprocessing,which of course is where the laplace transform reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,53,0,0,554.870,14,15,signalprocessing,and if we apply to this equation the differentiation property then the derivative the laplace transform of the derivative is s times the laplace transform of the time function , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,55,0,0,572.580,5,6,signalprocessing,and so consequently applying the laplace transform to this equation leads us to this algebraic equation and following that through leads us to the statement that the laplace transform of the output is one over s plus a times the laplace transform of the input , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,56,0,0,590.620,8,9,signalprocessing,we know from the convolution property that this laplace transform is the system function times x of s , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,57,0,0,598.020,14,15,signalprocessing,and so one over s plus a is the system function or equivalently the laplace transform of the impulse response , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,58,0,0,607.420,11,12,signalprocessing,so we can determine the impulse response by taking the inverse laplace transform of h of s given by one over s plus a , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,60,0,0,628.620,9,10,signalprocessing,the question is then what time function has a laplace transform which is one over s plus a , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,61,0,0,635.640,21,22,signalprocessing,the problem that we run into is that there are two answers to that one over s plus a is the laplace transform of an exponential for positive time but one over s plus a is also the laplace transform of an exponential for negative time , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,65,0,0,676.740,7,8,signalprocessing,in this case this was the corresponding laplace transform provided that the real part of s is less than minus a , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,84,0,0,832.950,14,15,signalprocessing,we can determine the system function in exactly the same way namely apply the laplace transform to this equation , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,115,0,0,1129.720,16,17,signalprocessing,and that corresponds to looking at the fourier transform of the impulse response which is the laplace transform on the j omega axis , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,249,0,0,2508.940,14,15,signalprocessing,we've been talking for the last several lectures about continuous time systems and the laplace transform , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,250,0,0,2517.230,17,18,signalprocessing,hopefully what you've seen in this lecture and the previous lecture is the powerful tool that the laplace transform affords us in analyzing and understanding system behavior , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,251,0,0,2534.440,74,75,signalprocessing,in the next lecture what i'd like to do is parallel the discussion for discrete time turn our attention to the z transform and as you can imagine simply by virtue of the fact that i have shown you a digital and analog version of very much the same kind of system the discussions parallel themselves very strongly and the z transform will play very much the same role in discrete time that the laplace transform does in continuous time , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,14,0,0,151.610,16,17,signalprocessing,well that set of notions is more or less identical to the way we motivated the laplace transform in the continuous time case in the fourier transform in the continuous time case , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,34,0,0,429.260,19,20,signalprocessing,so we've kind of motivated the development in a manner exactly identical to what we had done with the laplace transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,36,0,0,453.750,12,13,signalprocessing,and that corresponds to the z transform here it corresponded to the laplace transform in the continuous time case , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,40,0,0,486.730,6,7,signalprocessing,identical to the relationship between the laplace transform and the fourier transform in continuous time , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,45,0,0,547.900,14,15,signalprocessing,so we have a relationship like the one again that we had between the laplace transform and the fourier transform in continuous time , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,52,0,0,615.000,19,20,signalprocessing,well we now have ourselves in a similar situation again to what we had when we talked about the laplace transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,63,0,0,715.200,9,10,signalprocessing,it's very similar to what we did with the laplace transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,64,0,0,718.440,12,13,signalprocessing,but let me draw your attention to the fact that in the laplace transform the independent variable that we ended up with in talking about the fourier transform is different than what we're ending up with here , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,69,0,0,773.390,3,4,signalprocessing,now in the laplace transform we also had another important relationship and observation which was the fact that the laplace transform was the fourier transform of x of t modified , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,82,0,0,906.200,7,8,signalprocessing,and in continuous time we had the laplace transform as the fourier transform of x of t e to the minus sigma t , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,121,0,0,1232.820,5,6,signalprocessing,and just as with the laplace transform this range of values is referred to as the region of convergence of the z transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,122,0,0,1247.530,7,8,signalprocessing,now again as we saw with the laplace transform it's important to recognize that in specifying or having worked out the z transform of a sequence it's not just the algebraic expression but also the region of convergence that's required to uniquely specify it , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,129,0,0,1326.230,5,6,signalprocessing,and also as with the laplace transform it's convenient in looking at the z transform to represent it in the complex plane , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,130,0,0,1342.330,21,22,signalprocessing,in this case the complex plane referred to as the z plane whereas in continuous time when we talked about the laplace transform it was the s plane z of course because z is the complex variable in terms of which we're representing the z transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,139,0,0,1423.550,13,14,signalprocessing,just again to emphasize the relationships and differences with continuous time with the laplace transform it's the behavior in the s plane on the j omega axis that corresponds to the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,142,0,0,1448.930,5,6,signalprocessing,as we did with the laplace transform we'll be talking very often about transforms which are rational and rational transforms as we'll see represent systems which are characterized by linear constant coefficient difference equations , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,168,0,0,1704.460,6,7,signalprocessing,we had seen this with the laplace transform in terms of observing what happened as we move along the j omega axis , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,237,0,0,2356.990,5,6,signalprocessing,now just as with the laplace transform the region of convergence of the z transform as we've seen in this example is a very important part of the specification of the z transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,244,0,0,2452.420,4,5,signalprocessing,recall that with the laplace transform the region of convergence consisted of strips in the s plane , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,246,0,0,2472.490,3,4,signalprocessing,whereas with the laplace transform the region of convergence was dependent on the real part of s , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,259,0,0,2639.300,32,33,signalprocessing,if we combine that statement with the fact that there are no poles in the region of convergence then we end up with a statement similar to what we had with the laplace transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,276,0,0,2779.830,15,16,signalprocessing,and i've emphasized the fact that it parallels very closely what we did with the laplace transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,279,0,0,2806.580,21,22,signalprocessing,and the algebra for this is gone through in the text and you went through something similar to this with the laplace transform in the video course manual , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,285,0,0,2865.390,14,15,signalprocessing,and so there's a formal expression just as there's a formal expression for the laplace transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,287,0,0,2887.350,35,36,signalprocessing,so if we had a z transform as i indicate here and if we expand it out in a partial fraction expansion then we can recognize as we did in a similar style with the laplace transform we can recognize that each term together with the identified region of convergence corresponds to an exponential factor , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,300,0,0,3030.330,17,18,signalprocessing,on the other hand i've stressed that it's very similar to what we went through for the laplace transform except for a very important difference , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,301,0,0,3041.320,8,9,signalprocessing,the principal difference really being that with the laplace transform it was the j omega axis in the s plane that we focused attention on when we were thinking about the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,303,0,0,3058.580,27,28,signalprocessing,what we'll see when we continue this in the next lecture is that there are properties of the z transform just as there were properties of the laplace transform , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,5,0,0,61.240,3,4,signalprocessing,as with the laplace transform in continuous time we developed it as a generalization of the fourier transform , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,13,0,0,177.900,15,16,signalprocessing,now they z transform has a number of important and useful properties just as the laplace transform does , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,66,0,0,842.670,12,13,signalprocessing,well we have the same issue here as we had with the laplace transform namely the point that the difference equation tells us in essence what the algebraic expression is for the system function but doesn't specify the region of convergence , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,101,0,0,1189.020,17,18,signalprocessing,this is now a look at the z transform and we see very strong parallels to the laplace transform , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,104,0,0,1227.460,49,50,signalprocessing,what i'd like to do now is turn our attention to another very important reason for mapping from continuous time to discrete time and in the process of doing this what we'll need to do is exploit fairly heavily the insight intuition and procedures that we've developed for the laplace transform and the z transform , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,140,0,0,1656.560,10,11,signalprocessing,now what we can use are the properties of the laplace transform and the z transform to see what this means in terms of a mapping in particular using the differentiation property for laplace transforms , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,141,0,0,1672.390,2,3,signalprocessing,in the laplace transform domain we would have this , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,183,0,0,2208.200,27,28,signalprocessing,if we expand this in a partial fraction expansion and we look at the impulse response associated with this we know how to take the inverse of laplace transform of this where i'm just naturally assuming causality throughout the discussion the continuous time impulse response then is the sum of exponentials with these amplitudes and at these complex exponential frequencies , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,22,0,0,244.910,20,21,signalprocessing,and in order to convert this to an expression describing the system function or in terms of the more general laplace transform variable s what we recognize is that j omega in the more general setting simply corresponds to the laplace transform variable s , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,23,0,0,265.860,7,8,signalprocessing,so this product in fact is the laplace transform for s equal to j omega , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,126,0,0,1524.430,28,29,signalprocessing,the bilinear transformation which i won't try to derive here in any detail is a mapping of continuous time filters to discrete time filters corresponding to taking the laplace transform variable s in the continuous time filter and replacing it by what is referred to as a bilinear function of z , Lecture25FeedbackMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,118,0,0,1138.460,17,18,signalprocessing,in generating the equivalent system function for the overall system it's best done in the frequency or laplace transform domain rather than in the time domain , Lecture25FeedbackMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,121,0,0,1158.480,25,26,signalprocessing,but basically if we look at this feedback system we can label of course since the output is y of t we can label the laplace transform of the output as y of s , Lecture25FeedbackMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,123,0,0,1175.330,7,8,signalprocessing,because this is the system function the laplace transform of r of t is simply the laplace transform of this input which is y of s times g of s , Lecture25FeedbackMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,126,0,0,1195.940,3,4,signalprocessing,and so the laplace transform of the error signal is simply x of s minus r of s which is y of s g of s , Lecture25FeedbackMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,128,0,0,1212.440,2,3,signalprocessing,that's the laplace transform of the error signal , Lecture25FeedbackMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,129,0,0,1215.580,1,2,signalprocessing,the laplace transform of the output of this system is simply this expression times h of s , Lecture25FeedbackMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,192,0,0,1763.610,3,4,signalprocessing,namely has a laplace transform or system function which is one over p of s , Lecture26FeedbackExampleTheInvertedPendulumMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,60,1,0,530.900,5,6,signalprocessing,and if we apply the laplace transform to this equation and solve for the system function then the basic equation that we're left with expresses the laplace transform of the angle equal to the system function the open loop system function times the laplace transform of the combined inputs , Lecture26FeedbackExampleTheInvertedPendulumMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,118,1,0,991.720,6,7,signalprocessing,then the overall expression for the laplace transform of the output angle is as i indicate here namely that theta of s is proportional through this system function , Lecture26FeedbackExampleTheInvertedPendulumMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,119,1,0,1008.170,2,3,signalprocessing,so the laplace transform of the input x of t and let me remind you that x of t the external disturbances now represent the only input since the other input corresponding to the applied acceleration to the cart is now controlled only through the feedback loop , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,9,0,0,129.380,17,18,signalprocessing,later on in the course when we've developed the concept of the fourier transform after that the laplace transform we'll see some very efficient and useful ways of generating solutions both for differential and difference equations , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,272,0,0,2775.560,26,27,signalprocessing,and beginning with the next set of lectures we'll be talking about the fourier transform and much later in the course what's referred to as the laplace transform for continuous time and the z transform for discrete time ]

Concept = FT32
Keyword = [Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,20,0,0,228.930,24,25,signalprocessing,and also by the way as it developed later that frequency response as you should now recognize from this expression is in fact the fourier transform the continuous time fourier transform of the system impulse response , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,21,0,0,246.170,19,20,signalprocessing,and the notion of decomposing a signal as a linear combination of these complex exponentials is what first the fourier series representation and then later the fourier transform representation corresponded to , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,33,0,0,398.340,14,15,signalprocessing,this particular expression in fact will correspond to what we'll refer to as the fourier transform the discrete time fourier transform of the system impulse response , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,35,0,0,418.330,35,36,signalprocessing,now just as we did in continuous time let's begin the discussion by first concentrating on periodic the representation through complex exponentials of periodic sequences and then we'll generalize that discussion to the representation of aperiodic signals , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,64,0,0,747.580,15,16,signalprocessing,so in fact in place of this expression it will be common in writing the fourier series expression to write it as i've indicated here where the implication is that these fourier coefficients periodically repeat as k continues to repeat outside the interval from zero to n minus one , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,65,0,0,769.370,26,27,signalprocessing,and so this notation in fact says that what we're going to use is k ranging over one period of this periodic sequence which is the fourier series coefficients , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,66,0,0,787.730,9,10,signalprocessing,so the expression that we have then for the fourier series i've repeated here , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,83,0,0,913.750,18,19,signalprocessing,now there is a real difference between the way those equations look and the way the continuous time fourier series looked , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,89,0,0,976.050,17,18,signalprocessing,so we have then to summarize the synthesis equation and the analysis equation for the discrete time fourier series , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,109,0,0,1195.670,9,10,signalprocessing,ok well let's look at an example of the fourier series representation for a particular signal , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,114,0,0,1233.370,6,7,signalprocessing,and if we look at the fourier series coefficients we can either look at it in terms of real and imaginary parts or magnitude and angle , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,116,0,0,1250.150,20,21,signalprocessing,and let me draw your attention to the fact that i've drawn this to specifically illuminate the periodicity of the fourier series coefficients with a period of capital n , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,121,0,0,1287.500,8,9,signalprocessing,and then because of the periodicity of the fourier series coefficients this simply periodically repeats , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,128,0,0,1344.090,4,5,signalprocessing,and i've expressed the fourier series coefficients which are algebraically developed in the text , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,129,0,0,1350.340,3,4,signalprocessing,i've expressed the fourier series coefficients as samples of an envelope function , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,132,0,0,1372.850,18,19,signalprocessing,which is the continuous time square wave where with the continuous times square wave the form of the fourier series coefficients was as samples of what we refer to as a sin x over x function , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,133,0,0,1391.050,14,15,signalprocessing,now the sin nx over sin x function which is the envelope of the fourier series coefficients for the discrete time periodic square wave plays the role and we'll see it very often in discrete time that sin x over x does in continuous time , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,134,0,0,1411.080,26,27,signalprocessing,and in fact we should understand right from the beginning that the sin x over x envelope couldn't possibly be the envelope of the discrete time fourier series coefficients , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,138,0,0,1439.710,27,28,signalprocessing,so once again if we look back at the algebraic expression that i have it's samples of the sin nx over sine x function that represent the fourier series coefficients of this periodic square wave , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,139,0,0,1456.160,21,22,signalprocessing,now in the representation in the continuous time case we essentially had used the concept of an envelope to represent the fourier series coefficients and the notion that the fourier series coefficients were samples of an envelope , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,143,0,0,1504.280,10,11,signalprocessing,these samples of this envelope function would then represent the fourier series coefficients , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,144,0,0,1512.340,23,24,signalprocessing,if we increased the period then we would simply have a finer spacing on the samples of the envelope function to get the fourier series coefficients , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,147,0,0,1543.810,8,9,signalprocessing,as the period increases we can view the fourier series coefficients as samples of an envelope , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,150,0,0,1566.140,30,31,signalprocessing,and recall also that this was essentially the trick that we used in continuous time to allow us to develop or utilize the fourier series to provide a representation of aperiodic signals as a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,152,0,0,1607.110,13,14,signalprocessing,and then we developed the notion that since the periodic signal has a fourier series and since as the period of the periodic signal increases and goes to infinity the periodic signal represents the aperiodic signal , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,153,0,0,1626.520,3,4,signalprocessing,then essentially the fourier series provides us with a representation , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,160,0,0,1687.310,10,11,signalprocessing,and as the period goes off to infinity it's the fourier series representation of the periodic signal that provides a representation of the aperiodic signal , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,173,0,0,1775.590,7,8,signalprocessing,specifically here is our representation through the fourier series of the here is a representation through the envelope function , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,174,0,0,1791.760,4,5,signalprocessing,and this is the fourier series synthesis equation where the equation below tells us how we get these fourier coefficients or the envelope from x of n , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,186,0,0,1875.210,9,10,signalprocessing,and as n goes to infinity then what the fourier series becomes is the fourier transform as summarized by the bottom two equations , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,190,0,0,1909.230,4,5,signalprocessing,in which case the fourier series coefficients become these envelopes functions , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,192,0,0,1919.890,9,10,signalprocessing,so what we have then is the discrete time fourier transform which is a representation of an aperiodic signal , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,194,0,0,1941.470,7,8,signalprocessing,and this is the integral that the fourier series synthesis equation went to as the period went off to infinity , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,195,0,0,1952.800,16,17,signalprocessing,and we have the corresponding analysis equation which is shown below where this tells us the fourier transform , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,196,0,0,1961.180,6,7,signalprocessing,in effect the envelope or the fourier series coefficients of that periodic signal , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,202,0,0,2007.350,1,2,signalprocessing,it's fourier transform x of omega is a function of a continuous variable , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,207,0,0,2029.270,8,9,signalprocessing,however in the frequency domain remember that the fourier series coefficients were always periodic , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,212,0,0,2077.480,9,10,signalprocessing,all right notationally we'll again represent the discrete time fourier transform pair as i indicated here , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,218,0,0,2134.110,7,8,signalprocessing,as the period goes to infinity the fourier transform of this is represented by the envelope of those fourier series coefficients and that was our sin nx over sin x function which in this particular case for these particular numbers is sin five omega over two divided by sin omega over two , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,226,0,0,2214.670,6,7,signalprocessing,basically if we substitute into the fourier transform analysis equation it's this sum that we evaluate , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,232,0,0,2263.330,11,12,signalprocessing,and let's in particular focus on what the magnitude of the fourier transform looks like , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,236,0,0,2289.090,7,8,signalprocessing,and the periodicity is inherent in the fourier transform in discrete time so we really might only need to look at this either from minus pi to pi or from zero to two pi , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,243,0,0,2358.500,4,5,signalprocessing,now we developed the fourier transform by beginning with the fourier series , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,246,0,0,2372.920,4,5,signalprocessing,is now absorb the fourier series within the broader framework of the fourier transform , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,247,0,0,2381.540,7,8,signalprocessing,and there are two relationships between the fourier series and the fourier transform which are identical to relationships that we had in the continuous time case , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,248,0,0,2394.250,23,24,signalprocessing,let me remind you that in continuous time we had the statement that if we have a periodic signal that in fact the fourier series coefficients of that periodic signal is proportional to samples of the fourier transform of one period , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,249,0,0,2423.140,25,26,signalprocessing,well in fact let me remind you flows easily from all the things that we built up so far because of the fact that the fourier transform essentially by definition of the way we developed it is what we get as the fourier series coefficients as we focus on one period and then let the period go off to infinity , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,250,0,0,2451.050,6,7,signalprocessing,well looking at one period the fourier transform of that then is the envelope of the fourier series coefficients , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,254,0,0,2500.790,10,11,signalprocessing,if we have a periodic signal and we consider the fourier transform of one period the fourier series coefficients of this periodic signal are in fact samples as stated mathematically in the bottom equation samples of the fourier transform of one period , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,255,0,0,2527.340,6,7,signalprocessing,so x of omega is the fourier transform of one period , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,256,0,0,2531.180,5,6,signalprocessing,a sub k's are the fourier series coefficients of the periodic signal , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,260,0,0,2565.690,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier transform of one period in fact represents the envelope , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,262,0,0,2577.180,5,6,signalprocessing,represents the envelope of the fourier series coefficients , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,263,0,0,2582.520,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier series coefficients are samples , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,264,0,0,2588.390,11,12,signalprocessing,so what we have then is a relationship back to the fourier series coefficients from the fourier transform that tells us that for a periodic signal now the periodic signal the fourier series coefficients are related are samples of the fourier transform of one period , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,265,0,0,2611.920,28,29,signalprocessing,now finally to kind of bring things back in a circle and exactly identical to what we did in the continuous time case we can finally absorb the fourier series in discrete time , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,266,0,0,2627.310,9,10,signalprocessing,we can absorb it into the framework of the fourier transform , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,270,0,0,2658.150,7,8,signalprocessing,the periodic signal is represented through a fourier series and fourier series coefficients , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,271,0,0,2664.360,19,20,signalprocessing,essentially what i pointed out at that time was that if we define take it as a definition the fourier transform of the periodic signal as an impulse train where the amplitudes of the impulses are proportional to the fourier series coefficients , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,272,0,0,2684.680,13,14,signalprocessing,if we take that impulse train representation and simply plug it into the fourier transform synthesis equation what we end up with is the fourier series synthesis equation , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,273,0,0,2704.860,13,14,signalprocessing,so in continuous time we had used this definition of the continuous time fourier transform of a periodic signal , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,276,0,0,2739.810,11,12,signalprocessing,so in discrete time if we have a periodic signal the fourier transform of that periodic signal is defined as an impulse train where the amplitudes of the impulses are proportional to the fourier series coefficients , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,277,0,0,2757.500,11,12,signalprocessing,if this expression is substituted into the synthesis equation for the fourier transform that will simply then reduce to the synthesis equation for the fourier series , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,279,0,0,2790.740,10,11,signalprocessing,here is the periodic signal and below it are the fourier series coefficients where i've removed the envelope function and just indicate the amplitudes of the coefficients indexed of course on the coefficient number , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,281,0,0,2809.550,7,8,signalprocessing,and if instead of talking about the fourier series coefficients what i want to talk about is the fourier transform the fourier transform in essence corresponds to simply redrawing that using impulses and using an axis that is essentially indexed on the fundamental frequency omega zero rather than on the fourier series coefficient number k , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,287,0,0,2906.750,6,7,signalprocessing,whereas in continuous time for the fourier transform we had a duality between the time domain and frequency domain , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,295,0,0,2970.290,3,4,signalprocessing,again on the fourier transform the discrete time fourier transform develop or illuminate some of the properties of the fourier transform and then see how these properties can be used for a number of things , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,4,0,0,55.260,10,11,signalprocessing,last time we began the development of the discrete time fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,68.710,4,5,signalprocessing,this led to the fourier series , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,7,0,0,71.060,7,8,signalprocessing,and then we generalized that to the fourier transform and finally incorporated within the framework of the fourier transform both aperiodic and periodic signals , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,0,0,83.070,17,18,signalprocessing,in today's lecture what i'd like to do is expand on some of the properties of the fourier transform and indicate how those properties are used for a variety of things , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,0,0,94.770,6,7,signalprocessing,well let's begin by reviewing the fourier transform as we developed it last time , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,107.040,13,14,signalprocessing,the synthesis equation expressing x of n the sequence in terms of the fourier transform and the analysis equation telling us how to obtain the fourier transform from the original sequence , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,12,0,0,122.890,36,37,signalprocessing,and i draw your attention again to the basic point that the synthesis equation essentially corresponds to decomposing the sequence as a linear combination of complex exponentials with amplitudes that are in effect proportional to the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,13,0,0,145.820,4,5,signalprocessing,now the discrete time fourier transform just as the continuous time fourier transform has a number of important and useful properties , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,16,0,0,180.540,7,8,signalprocessing,also as i indicated last time the fourier transform is a periodic function of frequency and the periodicity is with a period of two pi , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,17,0,0,196.030,8,9,signalprocessing,and so it says in effect that the fourier transform if we replace the frequency variable by an integer multiple of two pi the function repeats , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,20,0,0,236.780,6,7,signalprocessing,just as in continuous time the fourier transform has important symmetry properties , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,21,0,0,243.560,14,15,signalprocessing,and in particular if the sequence x sub n is real valued then the fourier transform is conjugate symmetric , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,22,0,0,254.680,18,19,signalprocessing,in other words if we replace omega by minus omega that's equivalent to applying complex conjugation to the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,26,0,0,306.730,4,5,signalprocessing,and that is the fourier transform of a real damped exponential , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,28,0,0,323.590,6,7,signalprocessing,we saw last time that the fourier transform for this sequence algebraically is of this form , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,38,0,0,382.630,7,8,signalprocessing,we have this inherent periodicity in the fourier transform which i'm stressing very heavily because it forms the basic difference between continuous time and discrete time , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,39,0,0,396.170,7,8,signalprocessing,in addition to these properties of the fourier transform there are a number of other properties that are particularly useful in the manipulation of the fourier transform and in fact in using the fourier transform to for example analyze systems represented by linear constant coefficient difference equations , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,42,0,0,433.210,14,15,signalprocessing,and the time shifting property tells us that if x of omega is the fourier transform of x of n then the fourier transform of x of n shifted in time is that same fourier transform multiplied by this factor which is a linear phase factor , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,46,0,0,493.030,19,20,signalprocessing,and we'll see this frequency shifting property surface in a slightly different way shortly when we talk about the modulation property in the discrete time case , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,47,0,0,504.840,22,23,signalprocessing,another important property that we'll want to make use of shortly is linearity which follows in a very straightforward way from the fourier transform definition , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,48,0,0,516.860,8,9,signalprocessing,and the linearity property says simply that the fourier transform of a sum or linear combination is the same linear combination of the fourier transforms , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,50,0,0,532.750,38,39,signalprocessing,and also among other properties there is a parseval's relation for the discrete time case that in effect says something similar to continuous time specifically that the energy in the sequence is proportional to the energy in the fourier transform the energy over one period , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,51,0,0,557.370,30,31,signalprocessing,or said another way in fact or another way that it can be said is that the energy in the time domain is proportional to the power in this periodic fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,54,0,0,580.140,20,21,signalprocessing,two additional properties that will play important roles in discrete time just as they did in continuous time are the convolution property and the modulation property , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,55,0,0,593.730,13,14,signalprocessing,the convolution property is the property that tells us how to relate the fourier transform of the convolution of two sequences to the fourier transforms of the individual sequences , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,56,0,0,608.940,14,15,signalprocessing,and not surprisingly what happens and this can be demonstrated algebraically not surprisingly the fourier transform of the convolution is simply the product of the fourier transforms , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,57,0,0,624.960,1,2,signalprocessing,so fourier transform maps convolution in the time domain to multiplication in the frequency domain , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,60,0,0,647.710,12,13,signalprocessing,the convolution property then tells us that in the frequency domain the fourier transform is the product of the fourier transform of the impulse response and the fourier transform of the input , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,61,0,0,665.120,12,13,signalprocessing,now we also saw and have talked about a relationship between the fourier transform the impulse response and what we call the frequency response in the context of the response of a system to a complex exponential , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,64,0,0,705.920,21,22,signalprocessing,and as you saw in the video course manual this eigenvalue this constant multiplier on the exponential is in fact the fourier transform of the impulse response evaluated at that frequency , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,67,0,0,733.280,6,7,signalprocessing,the frequency response interpretation of the fourier transform the impulse response we use that to motivate an intuitive interpretation of the convolution property , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,68,0,0,746.550,15,16,signalprocessing,now formally the convolution property can be developed by taking the convolution sum applying the fourier transform sum to it doing the appropriate substitution of variables interchanging order of summations et cetera and all the algebra works out to show that it's a product , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,71,0,0,783.330,6,7,signalprocessing,specifically the argument was that the fourier transform of a sequence or signal corresponds to decomposing it into a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,73,0,0,801.310,5,6,signalprocessing,it's basically proportional to the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,74,0,0,805.990,25,26,signalprocessing,if we think of pushing through the system that linear combination then each of those complex exponentials gets the amplitude modified or multiplied by the fourier transform of by the frequency response which we saw is the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,76,0,0,841.470,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier transform of the output in effect is an expression expressing the summation or integration of the output as a linear combination of all of these exponentials with the appropriate complex amplitudes , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,77,0,0,859.580,7,8,signalprocessing,so it's important in thinking about the convolution property to think about it in terms of nothing more than the fact that we've decomposed the input and we're now modifying separately through multiplication through scaling the amplitudes of each of the complex exponential components , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,78,0,0,887.230,13,14,signalprocessing,now what we saw in continuous time is that this interpretation and the convolution property led to an important concept namely the concept of filtering , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,102,0,0,1103.620,5,6,signalprocessing,ok so we've seen the convolution property and its interpretation in terms of filtering , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,103,0,0,1111.760,3,4,signalprocessing,more broadly the convolution property in combination with a number of the other properties that i introduced in particular the time shifting and linearity property allows us to generate or analyze systems that are described by linear constant coefficient difference equations , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,111,0,0,1191.140,14,15,signalprocessing,let's now consider generating the solution by taking advantage of the properties of the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,112,0,0,1199.270,13,14,signalprocessing,well just as we did in continuous time we can consider applying the fourier transform to both sides of this equation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,113,0,0,1207.210,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier transform of y of n of course is y of omega , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,114,0,0,1212.680,11,12,signalprocessing,and then using the shifting property the time shifting property the fourier transform of y of n minus one is y of omega multiplied by e to the minus j omega , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,116,0,0,1234.290,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier transform of x of n is x of omega , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,117,0,0,1239.020,8,9,signalprocessing,well we can solve this equation for the fourier transform of the output in terms of the fourier transform of the input and an appropriate complex scale factor , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,120,0,0,1275.860,9,10,signalprocessing,at this point we can recognize that here the fourier transform of the output is the product of the fourier transform of the input and some complex function , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,121,0,0,1288.860,20,21,signalprocessing,and from the convolution property then that complex function must in fact correspond to the frequency response or equivalently the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,122,0,0,1305.620,7,8,signalprocessing,so if we want to determine the fourier transform of the or the impulse response of the system let's say for example then it becomes a matter of having identified the fourier transform of the impulse response which is the frequency response , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,125,0,0,1330.730,16,17,signalprocessing,of course we could do it by attempting to go through the synthesis equation for the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,127,0,0,1345.362,18,19,signalprocessing,and in particular we know that from an example that we worked before this is in fact the fourier transform of a sequence which is a to the n times u of n , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,172,0,0,1817.200,5,6,signalprocessing,now in addition to the convolution property another important property that we had in continuous time and that we have in discrete time is the modulation property , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,173,0,0,1831.500,1,2,signalprocessing,the modulation property tells us what happens in the frequency domain when you multiply signals in the time domain , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,174,0,0,1841.700,4,5,signalprocessing,in continuous time the modulation property corresponded to the statement that if we multiply the time domain we convolve the fourier transforms in the frequency domain , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,178,0,0,1901.050,5,6,signalprocessing,so again we have a convolution property in discrete time that is very much like the convolution property in continuous time , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,181,0,0,1928.570,10,11,signalprocessing,well let's take a look at an example of the modulation property which will then lead to one particular application and a very useful application of the modulation property in discrete time , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,185,0,0,1983.200,15,16,signalprocessing,in applying the modulation property of course what we need to do is develop the fourier transform of this signal , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,189,0,0,2008.700,6,7,signalprocessing,and recall that to get the fourier transform of a periodic signal one way to do it is to generate the fourier series coefficients for the periodic signal and then identify the fourier transform as an impulse train where the heights of the impulses in the impulse train are proportional with a proportionality factor of two pi proportional to the fourier series coefficients , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,190,0,0,2038.200,7,8,signalprocessing,so let's first work out what the fourier series is and for this example in fact it's fairly easy , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,191,0,0,2044.580,8,9,signalprocessing,here is the general synthesis equation for the fourier series , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,198,0,0,2119.760,9,10,signalprocessing,so we've done it simply by essentially inspecting the fourier series synthesis equation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,199,0,0,2130.950,8,9,signalprocessing,ok now if we want to get the fourier transform for this we take those coefficients and essentially generate an impulse train where we choose as values for the impulses two pi times the fourier series coefficients , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,200,0,0,2150.680,2,3,signalprocessing,so the fourier series coefficients are a zero is equal to zero and a one is equal to one , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,201,0,0,2156.630,12,13,signalprocessing,so notice that in the plot that i've shown here of the fourier transform of x one of n we have the zero th coefficient , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,206,0,0,2201.150,3,4,signalprocessing,corresponds to the fourier series coefficient a sub minus one , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,207,0,0,2205.560,26,27,signalprocessing,and of course if we drew this out over a longer frequency axis we would see lots of other impulses because of the fact that the fourier transform periodically repeats or equivalently the fourier series coefficients periodically repeat , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,213,0,0,2259.800,11,12,signalprocessing,let's consider a signal x two of n which has a fourier transform as i've indicated here , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,214,0,0,2267.300,2,3,signalprocessing,then the fourier transform of the product of x one of n and x two of n is the convolution of these two spectra , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,218,0,0,2316.180,8,9,signalprocessing,and so this spectrum finally corresponds to the fourier transform of minus one to the n times x two of n where x two of n is the sequence whose spectrum was x two of omega , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,225,0,0,2376.730,19,20,signalprocessing,let me draw your attention to the fact that when a is positive we have this sequence and its fourier transform is as i show on the right , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,227,0,0,2403.030,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier transform of that you can now see and verify also algebraically if you'd like is identical to this spectrum simply shifted by pi , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,230,0,0,2438.250,10,11,signalprocessing,and we can interpret that in the context of the modulation property , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,236,0,0,2524.650,18,19,signalprocessing,since this ideal highpass filter is this ideal lowpass filter with the frequency response shifted by pi the modulation property tells us that in the time domain what that corresponds to is an impulse response multiplied by minus one to the n , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,237,0,0,2546.950,15,16,signalprocessing,so it says that the impulse response of the highpass filter or equivalently the inverse fourier transform of the highpass filter frequency response is minus one to the n times the impulse response for the lowpass filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,238,0,0,2563.780,5,6,signalprocessing,that all follows from the modulation property , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,241,0,0,2580.710,1,2,signalprocessing,the modulation property tells us about multiplying the time domain is shifting in the frequency domain , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,258,0,0,2748.930,12,13,signalprocessing,well let's begin this summary by first looking at the continuous time fourier series , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,259,0,0,2757.240,4,5,signalprocessing,in the continuous time fourier series we have a periodic time function expanded as a linear combination of harmonically related complex exponentials , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,261,0,0,2775.710,13,14,signalprocessing,and we saw an analysis equation which tells us how to get these fourier series coefficients through an integration on the original time function , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,263,0,0,2794.250,13,14,signalprocessing,what we end up with in the frequency domain is a sequence of fourier series coefficients which in fact is an infinite sequence namely requires all values of k in general , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,264,0,0,2809.380,9,10,signalprocessing,we had then generalized that to the continuous time fourier transform and in effect in doing that what happened is that the synthesis equation in the fourier series became an integral relationship in the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,269,0,0,2895.110,6,7,signalprocessing,we began with the discrete time fourier series , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,273,0,0,2929.640,8,9,signalprocessing,and we ended up with a set of fourier series coefficients , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,274,0,0,2933.270,6,7,signalprocessing,which of course are discrete as fourier series coefficients are and which periodically repeat because of the fact that the associated complex exponentials periodically repeat , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,277,0,0,2987.190,9,10,signalprocessing,and this term x of omega which is the fourier transform is given by this summation and of course involves all of the values of x of n , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,284,0,0,3044.230,17,18,signalprocessing,and so in fact if we make reference to duality there isn't duality in the continuous time fourier series , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,285,0,0,3055.900,5,6,signalprocessing,however for the continuous time fourier transform we're talking about aperiodic time functions and aperiodic frequency functions , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,287,0,0,3071.550,9,10,signalprocessing,in other words the time function effectively is the fourier transform of the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,289,0,0,3081.780,16,17,signalprocessing,and in fact we had exploited that duality property when we talked about the continuous time fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,290,0,0,3092.020,4,5,signalprocessing,with the discrete time fourier series we have a duality indicated by the fact that we have a periodic time function and a sequence which is periodic in the frequency domain , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,292,0,0,3115.200,6,7,signalprocessing,and so it's the discrete time fourier series that has a duality , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,293,0,0,3122.630,5,6,signalprocessing,and finally the discrete time fourier transform loses the duality because of the fact among other things that in the time domain things are inherently discrete whereas in the frequency domain they're inherently continuous , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,297,0,0,3159.610,12,13,signalprocessing,and we can see that first algebraically by comparing the continuous time fourier series and the discrete time fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,298,0,0,3174.240,3,4,signalprocessing,the continuous time fourier series in the time domain is a periodic continuous function in the frequency domain is an aperiodic sequence , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,302,0,0,3214.990,25,26,signalprocessing,and in fact if you look at the relationship between these two then what we see in fact is a duality between the continuous time fourier series and the discrete time fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,303,0,0,3236.500,32,33,signalprocessing,one way of thinking of that is to kind of think and this is a little bit of a tongue twister which you might want to get straightened out slowly but the fourier transform in discrete time is a periodic function of frequency , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,304,0,0,3252.270,5,6,signalprocessing,that periodic function has a fourier series representation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,305,0,0,3257.190,3,4,signalprocessing,what is this fourier series , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,306,0,0,3259.540,3,4,signalprocessing,what are the fourier series coefficients of that periodic function , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,307,0,0,3262.730,20,21,signalprocessing,well in fact except for an issue of time reversal what it is the original sequence for which that's the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,311,0,0,3295.000,6,7,signalprocessing,also as we've talked about the fourier transform both continuous time and discrete time two important properties that we focused on among many of the properties are the convolution property and the modulation property , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,312,0,0,3309.950,5,6,signalprocessing,we've also shown that the convolution property leads to a very important concept namely filtering , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,313,0,0,3319.020,1,2,signalprocessing,the modulation property leads to an important concept namely modulation , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,4,0,0,64.050,16,17,signalprocessing,two particularly significant ones as i mentioned at the time are the modulation property and the convolution property , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,5,0,0,72.860,21,22,signalprocessing,starting with the next lecture the one after this one we'll be developing and exploiting some of the consequences of the modulation property , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,82.260,27,28,signalprocessing,in today's lecture though i'd like to review and expand on the notion of filtering which as i had mentioned flows more or less directly from the convolution property , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,7,0,0,96.700,9,10,signalprocessing,to begin let me just quickly review what the convolution property is , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,0,0,101.260,15,16,signalprocessing,both for continuous time and for discrete time the convolution property tells us that the fourier transform of the convolution of two time functions is the product of the fourier transforms , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,0,0,119.190,47,48,signalprocessing,now what this means in terms of linear time invariant filters since we know that in the time domain the output of a linear time invariant filter is the convolution of the input and the impulse response it says essentially then in the frequency domain that the fourier transform of the output is the product the fourier transform of the impulse response namely the frequency response and the fourier transform of the input , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,156.370,7,8,signalprocessing,now recall also that in developing the fourier transform i interpreted the fourier transform as the complex amplitude of a decomposition of the signal in terms of a set of complex exponentials , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,12,0,0,172.120,6,7,signalprocessing,and the frequency response or the convolution property in effect tells us how to modify the amplitudes of each of those complex exponentials as they go through the system , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,47,0,0,454.760,10,11,signalprocessing,that means as a consequence of the properties of the fourier transform and inverse fourier transform that the impulse response is an even function in the time domain , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,91,0,0,891.480,34,35,signalprocessing,now we can write the differential equation for either of these systems and as we talked about last time in the last several lectures solve that equation using and exploiting the properties of the fourier transform , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,93,0,0,921.740,9,10,signalprocessing,and so just working our way down applying the fourier transform to the differential equation and generating the system function by taking the ratio of the capacitor voltage or its fourier transform to the fourier transform of the source we then have the system function associated with the system for which the output is the capacitor voltage , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,209,0,0,1859.870,5,6,signalprocessing,we've looked previously at the fourier transform of this rectangular sequence , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,210,0,0,1864.240,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier transform of that in fact is of the form of a sine n x over sine x curve , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,253,0,0,2257.540,23,24,signalprocessing,and so interpreting the first order difference equation as a system what we're attempting to generate is the frequency response which is the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,254,0,0,2272.760,23,24,signalprocessing,and from the difference equation we can of course solve for either one of those by using the properties exploiting the properties of fourier transform , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,255,0,0,2283.770,2,3,signalprocessing,applying the fourier transform to the difference equation we will end up with the fourier transform of the output equal to the fourier transform of the input times this factor which we know from the convolution property in fact is the frequency response of the system , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,257,0,0,2307.440,5,6,signalprocessing,and of course the inverse fourier transform of that which i indicate below is the system impulse response , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,258,0,0,2317.910,10,11,signalprocessing,so we have the frequency response obtained by applying the fourier transform to the difference equation the impulse response , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,23,0,0,294.670,28,29,signalprocessing,and what we'll see in particular as we go through today's lecture is that sinusoidal amplitude modulation follows in a fairly straightforward way from the properties of the fourier transform that we've developed in some of the earlier lectures , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,26,0,0,336.040,16,17,signalprocessing,and all of these follow in a very straightforward way from the modulation property for the fourier transform , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,34,0,0,401.640,19,20,signalprocessing,now to analyze this since we have multiplication in the time domain we know from the property of the fourier transform that we've developed previously the modulation property that multiplication in the time domain corresponds to convolution in the frequency domain , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,49,0,0,535.870,9,10,signalprocessing,well we can do that by concentrating on the modulation property , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,51,0,0,546.820,6,7,signalprocessing,what i've indicated here for the fourier transform of the input signal or modulating signal x of omega , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,53,0,0,565.760,13,14,signalprocessing,and then the carrier signal since it's a single complex exponential has a fourier transform which is an impulse in the frequency domain , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,153,0,0,1431.460,7,8,signalprocessing,and so now when we apply the modulation property we have the original spectrum which i show here x of omega , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,160,0,0,1475.340,7,8,signalprocessing,and so now when we apply the modulation property what we will do is convolve this spectrum with this spectrum and the result is that the spectrum of the original signal gets replicated at both omega sub c and at minus omega sub c , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,351,0,0,3167.180,15,16,signalprocessing,so from what might have seemed like a fairly abstract mathematical property associated with the fourier transform we've begun to develop what should give you the sense of some important practical considerations , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,40,1,0,240.510,34,35,signalprocessing,and actually as you realize from the previous lectures with the triangle and square wave with the same fundamental as the sine wave the richness comes in because of the higher harmonics in the fourier series representation , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,106,1,0,613.770,3,4,signalprocessing,it computes the fourier transform or the spectrum , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,110,1,0,649.410,24,25,signalprocessing,it's filtered and sampled and captured on a block basis put into a digital memory and then a digital computer or microprocessor computes the fourier transform , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,111,1,0,662.250,3,4,signalprocessing,and then that fourier transform is what we see on the display , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,112,1,0,666.930,10,11,signalprocessing,so what we're computing of course are samples of the fourier transform , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,114,1,0,676.040,5,6,signalprocessing,was a rectangular pulse whose fourier transform is of the form of a sine x over x function what we would in fact see on the display are samples of that at discrete frequencies , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,115,1,0,689.900,21,22,signalprocessing,or if as we have an input which is a square wave what will generate through the spectrum analyzer are the fourier series coefficients or equivalently the harmonics associated with the square wave , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,130,1,0,800.320,27,28,signalprocessing,and then the amplitude of the square wave decays proportional to one over f which is the kind of analysis that we've gone through in looking at fourier series , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,149,1,0,888.010,3,6,signalprocessing,well speaking of time and frequency scaling recall that we had demonstrated time and frequency scaling previously with the glockenspiel , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,180,1,0,1075.800,6,9,signalprocessing,so once again we see that time and frequency scaling really works , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,14,0,0,176.170,12,13,signalprocessing,and it was in continuous time the modulation property associated with the fourier transform that provided the basis for the analysis , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,16,0,0,192.120,17,18,signalprocessing,in particular what we have in discrete time is the modulation property as it relates to the fourier transform which tells us that the fourier transform of the modulated signal is the convolution of the fourier transform of the carrier and the fourier transform of the modulated signal , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,24,0,0,286.170,6,7,signalprocessing,well we have once again the modulation property , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,25,0,0,290.740,2,3,signalprocessing,and the modulation property tells us that the spectrum of the modulated signal is the periodic convolution of the two spectra , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,76,0,0,1014.580,10,11,signalprocessing,we had originally talked about this when we introduce the modulation property in the context of converting a low pass filter to a high pass filter , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,80,0,0,1096.590,18,19,signalprocessing,and as i've represented it here and as we had talked about it when we talked about the modulation property for discrete time signals we had specifically chosen the conversion of a low pass to a high pass filter , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,112,0,0,1478.860,14,15,signalprocessing,basically a square wave and as we've seen in previous lectures the spectra or fourier transform associated with that is an impulse train , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,114,0,0,1497.430,1,2,signalprocessing,the fourier transform is impulses , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,121,0,0,1537.780,8,9,signalprocessing,so in the frequency domain we have the fourier transform of the time function convolved with this fourier transform for the pulse train , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,123,0,0,1548.550,8,9,signalprocessing,if we were to consider let's say a fourier transform , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,5,1,0,59.960,50,51,signalprocessing,and just as a quick reminder the sampling theorem said that if we have a continuous time signal and we have equally spaced samples of that signal sampled at a sampling period which i indicate is capital t and if x of t is band limited in other words the fourier transform is zero outside some band where omega sub m is the highest frequency then under the condition that the sampling frequency which is two pi divided by the period is greater than twice the highest frequency , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,1,0,123.830,18,19,signalprocessing,and the sampling theorem developed by examining the consequence of the modulation property in the context of the fourier transform , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,1,0,133.940,70,71,signalprocessing,in particular if we have our signal x of t and if multiplied by an impulse train to give us a sampled signal another impulse train whose values or areas are samples of the original time function as i indicate here then in fact if we examine this equation or equivalently bringing x of t inside this sum if we examine either of these equations in the frequency domain the fourier transform of x of p of t is the convolution of the fourier transform of the original signal and the fourier transform of the impulse train , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,1,0,187.110,1,2,signalprocessing,it's fourier transform , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,13,1,0,193.880,12,13,signalprocessing,and when we do this convolution then using the fact that the fourier transform the impulse train is an impulse train , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,14,1,0,203.480,10,11,signalprocessing,the result of this convolution then tells us that the fourier transform of the sample signal or the impulse train which represents the samples is a sum of frequency shifted replications of the fourier transform of the original signal , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,18,1,0,249.280,72,73,signalprocessing,and again to remind you of the basic picture involved if we have an original signal with a spectrum as i indicated here where it's band limited with the highest frequency omega sub m and if the time function is sampled so that in the frequency domain we convolve this spectrum with the spectrum shown below which is the spectrum of the impulse train the convolution of these two is then the fourier transform or spectrum of the sample time function , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,23,1,0,345.990,1,2,signalprocessing,the fourier transform i show here of the original signal and after modulation with the impulse train the resulting spectrum that we have is that replicated around integer multiples of the sampling frequency , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,34,1,0,479.710,26,27,signalprocessing,if in fact the sampling frequency is not high enough to avoid aliasing then what happens in that case is that the individual replications of the fourier transform of the original signal overlap and what we end up with is some distortion , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,48,1,0,607.490,4,5,signalprocessing,and the spectrum or fourier transform of that is an impulse in the frequency domain at the frequency of the sinusoid , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,68,1,0,823.840,2,3,signalprocessing,and its fourier transform is an impulse in the frequency domain as we've indicated , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,70,1,0,835.670,9,10,signalprocessing,and so its samples in particular will have a fourier transform not only with an impulse at the input sinusoidal frequency but also at ten kilohertz minus that frequency , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,87,1,0,998.480,5,6,signalprocessing,the bottom trace is the fourier transform of the sampled waveform , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,171,0,0,1553.670,35,36,signalprocessing,well instead of the zero order hold if we used the first order hold corresponding to the triangular impulse response in that case then in the frequency domain the associated frequency response would be the fourier transform of the triangle , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,172,0,0,1569.090,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier transform of a triangle is a sine squared x over x squared kind of function , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,251,0,0,2311.670,40,41,signalprocessing,so what i'd like to do as a first step in understanding this process is to analyze it in particular with our attention focused on trying to understand what the relationship is in the frequency domain between the discrete time fourier transform of the sequence discrete time signal and the continuous time fourier transform of the original unsampled and then the sampled signal , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,261,0,0,2403.080,11,12,signalprocessing,so in the frequency domain we have a convolution of the fourier transform of the continuous time signal the original signal and the fourier transform of the impulse train which is itself an impulse train , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,262,0,0,2418.590,7,8,signalprocessing,so in the frequency domain then the fourier transform of the sampled signal which is an impulse train is the convolution of the fourier transform of the sampling function p of t and the fourier transform of the sampled signal , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,263,0,0,2436.440,10,11,signalprocessing,since the sampling signal is a periodic impulse train its fourier transform is an impulse train , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,264,0,0,2444.750,11,12,signalprocessing,and consequently carrying out this convolution in effect says that this fourier transform simply gets replicated at each of the locations of these impulses , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,265,0,0,2457.600,10,11,signalprocessing,and finally what we end up with then is a fourier transform after the sampling process which is the original fourier transform of the continuous signal but added to itself shifted by integer multiples of the sampling frequency , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,274,0,0,2533.840,10,11,signalprocessing,and what we want to relate is the discrete time fourier transform of this and the continuous time fourier transform of this or in fact the continuous time fourier transform of x of c of t , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,276,0,0,2554.930,2,3,signalprocessing,and it's fourier transform we can get by simply evaluating the fourier transform , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,277,0,0,2562.000,3,4,signalprocessing,and since the fourier transform of this since this corresponds to an impulse train the fourier transform by the time we change some sums and integrals will then have this impulse replaced by the fourier transform of the shifted impulse which is this exponential factor , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,278,0,0,2581.570,5,6,signalprocessing,so this expression is the fourier transform of the impulse train the continuous time fourier transform , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,279,0,0,2588.850,7,8,signalprocessing,and alternatively we can look at the fourier transform of the sequence , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,280,0,0,2595.080,8,9,signalprocessing,and this of course is a discrete time fourier transform , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,281,0,0,2601.110,6,7,signalprocessing,so we have the continuous time fourier transform of the impulse train we have the discrete fourier transform of the sequence , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,288,0,0,2669.970,14,15,signalprocessing,and so in fact the relationship that we have is that the discrete time fourier transform of the sequence of samples is equal to the continuous time fourier transform of the impulse train of samples where we associate the continuous time frequency variable and the discrete time frequency variable through a frequency scaling as i indicate here , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,292,0,0,2726.130,9,10,signalprocessing,in the frequency domain that corresponds to replicating the fourier transform of the original continuous time signal , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,310,0,0,2888.470,9,10,signalprocessing,in the frequency domain what we have is the fourier transform of our original continuous signal , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,60,0,0,739.790,23,24,signalprocessing,and so now the spectrum of y of n the output of the digital filter is the product of this spectrum and the fourier transform or frequency response of the digital filter , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,26,0,0,299.680,4,5,signalprocessing,as we know the fourier transform of an impulse train is itself an impulse train , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,27,0,0,305.560,5,6,signalprocessing,and so this is the fourier transform of the sampling sequence , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,28,0,0,311.990,4,5,signalprocessing,and now finally the fourier transform of the resulting sample sequence being the convolution of this with the fourier transform of the sequence that we're sampling , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,29,0,0,326.300,15,16,signalprocessing,gives us then a spectrum which consists of a sum of replicated versions of the fourier transform of the sequence that we're sampling , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,38,0,0,420.460,3,4,signalprocessing,this is its fourier transform with an assumed highest frequency omega sub m highest frequency over a two pi range or over a range of pi rather , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,45,0,0,489.740,34,35,signalprocessing,now when we look at this what we recognize is that we have basically the same issue here as we had in continuous time in the sense that when these individual replications of the fourier transform when the sampling frequency is chosen high enough so that they don't overlap then we see the potential for being able to get one of them back , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,50,0,0,567.160,9,10,signalprocessing,and in this picture the individual replications of the fourier transform of the original signal overlap , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,51,0,0,576.700,7,8,signalprocessing,and we can no longer recover the fourier transform of the original signal , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,54,0,0,598.680,9,10,signalprocessing,so in that case what we have is a fourier transform for the sampled signal which is as i indicated here and the fourier transform for the original signal as i indicate at the top , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,104,0,0,1082.870,10,11,signalprocessing,in particular what we want to develop is how the fourier transform of the decimated sequence is related to the fourier transform of the original sequence or the sample sequence , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,114,0,0,1170.990,7,8,signalprocessing,and we know of course that the fourier transform of the sample sequence is just simply this summation , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,119,0,0,1220.080,5,6,signalprocessing,so this then is the fourier transform all of the sampled signal , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,120,0,0,1225.590,7,8,signalprocessing,and now if we look at the fourier transform of the decimated signal that fourier transform of course is this summation on the decimated sequence , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,125,0,0,1276.740,20,21,signalprocessing,so the consequence of that then what it all boils down to and says is that the relationship between the fourier transform of the decimated sequence and the fourier transform of the sampled sequence is simply a frequency scaling corresponding to dividing the frequency axis by capital n , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,130,0,0,1324.470,9,10,signalprocessing,and in the frequency domain we have again the fourier transform of the original sequence and we have the fourier transform of the sampled sequence , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,131,0,0,1343.350,3,4,signalprocessing,and now the fourier transform of the decimated sequence is simply this spectrum with a linear frequency scaling , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,154,0,0,1566.490,15,16,signalprocessing,and so the result of that the product of the filter frequency response and the fourier transform of x of n would have a shape somewhat like i indicate below , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,244,0,0,2432.370,14,15,signalprocessing,suppose that you have a signal and what you'd like to measure is its fourier transform its spectrum , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,247,0,0,2452.280,14,15,signalprocessing,and so in fact all that you can really calculate or measure is the fourier transform at a set of sample frequencies , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,250,0,0,2471.060,26,27,signalprocessing,and a reasonable question to ask then is when does a set of samples in fact tell you everything that there is to know about the fourier transform , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,253,0,0,2511.160,6,7,signalprocessing,and so we would multiply the fourier transform of the signal whose spectrum is to be sampled by an impulse train in frequency , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,256,0,0,2547.670,3,4,signalprocessing,or correspondingly the fourier transform of the resulting signal is an impulse train in frequency with an envelope which is the original spectrum that we were sampling , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,267,0,0,2611.340,23,24,signalprocessing,so in fact if we look at this in the time domain the resulting picture corresponds to an original signal whose spectrum or fourier transform we've sampled , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,271,0,0,2669.660,10,11,signalprocessing,we know that an impulse train in frequency is the fourier transform of a periodic time function , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,274,0,0,2683.240,10,11,signalprocessing,we know this from way back when we talked about fourier transforms the envelope in fact is the fourier transform of one period , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,276,0,0,2696.620,10,11,signalprocessing,now given that we have this periodic time function whose fourier transform is the samples in the frequency domain how do we get back the original time function , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,284,0,0,2804.820,22,23,signalprocessing,namely if we have a discrete time signal and if the discrete time signal is a finite length if we sample its fourier transform the time function associated with those samples is a periodic replication , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,296,0,0,2926.740,10,11,signalprocessing,and what those will correspond to are generalizations of the fourier transform , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,297,0,0,2932.930,20,21,signalprocessing,so we now want to turn our attention back to some analytical tools in particular developing some generalizations of the fourier transform in both continuous time and discrete time , Lecture1IntroductionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,150,0,0,1597.630,23,24,signalprocessing,and in the context of the frequency domain representation some of the kinds of ideas and topics that we'll be exploring are the fourier transform and the laplace transform and a discrete time counterpart of the laplace transform which is the z transform , Lecture1IntroductionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,151,0,0,1619.140,1,2,signalprocessing,the fourier transform discussion we'll get into fairly early in the course , Lecture1IntroductionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,152,0,0,1623.990,11,12,signalprocessing,and the laplace transform and z transform represent extensions of the fourier transform and we'll be getting into that later in the course , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,4,0,0,56.170,19,20,signalprocessing,over the last series of lectures in discussing filtering modulation and sampling we've seen how powerful and useful the fourier transform is , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,5,0,0,66.490,20,21,signalprocessing,beginning with this lecture and over the next several lectures i'd like to develop and exploit a generalization of the fourier transform which will not only lead to some important new insights about signals and systems but also will remove some of the restrictions that we've had with the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,125.080,20,21,signalprocessing,now to introduce the notion of the laplace transform let me remind you again of what led us into the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,135.380,3,4,signalprocessing,we developed the fourier transform by considering the idea of representing signals as linear combinations of basic signals , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,12,0,0,147.660,3,4,signalprocessing,and in the fourier transform in the continuous time case , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,19,0,0,227.100,18,19,signalprocessing,and this change in amplitude in fact corresponded as we showed as the discussion went along to the fourier transform of the system impulse response , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,20,0,0,240.380,15,16,signalprocessing,so the notion of decomposing signals into complex exponentials was very intimately connected and the fourier transform was very intimately connected with the eigenfunction property of complex exponentials for linear time invariant systems , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,41,0,0,459.990,16,17,signalprocessing,it's denoted as x of s and as a shorthand notation as we had with the fourier transform then we have in the time domain the time function x of t and in the laplace transform domain the function x of s , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,43,0,0,481.560,30,31,signalprocessing,now let me remind you that the development of that mapping is exactly the process the we went through initially in developing a mapping that ended up giving us the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,46,0,0,519.080,22,23,signalprocessing,well the discussion that we've gone through so far of course is very closely related to what we went through for the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,48,0,0,531.850,23,24,signalprocessing,and as you can well imagine and perhaps may have recognized already there's a very close connection between the laplace transform and the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,49,0,0,543.500,18,19,signalprocessing,well to see one of the connections what we can observe is that if we look at the fourier transform expression and if we look at the laplace transform expression where s is now a general complex number sigma plus j omega these two expressions in fact are identical if in fact sigma is equal to zero , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,52,0,0,587.530,33,34,signalprocessing,what this then tells us is that if we have the laplace transform and if we look at the laplace transform at s equals j omega then that in fact corresponds to the fourier transform of x of t , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,58,0,0,644.140,13,14,signalprocessing,on the other hand the right hand side of the equation namely the fourier transform of x of t we've typically written as x of omega , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,61,0,0,667.920,17,18,signalprocessing,and a very straightforward way of dealing with that is to simply change our notation for the fourier transform recognizing that the fourier transform of course is a function of omega but it's also in fact a function of j omega , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,63,0,0,689.440,20,21,signalprocessing,in other words the laplace transform at s equals j omega just simply reduces both mathematically and notationally to the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,64,0,0,699.100,10,11,signalprocessing,so the notation that we'll now be adopting for the fourier transform is the notation whereby we express the fourier transform no longer simply as x of omega but choosing as the argument j omega , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,66,0,0,719.620,8,9,signalprocessing,now here we see one relationship between the fourier transform and the laplace transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,67,0,0,726.560,13,14,signalprocessing,namely that the laplace transform for s equals j omega reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,69,0,0,737.340,13,14,signalprocessing,in particular the fact that the laplace transform can be interpreted as the fourier transform of a modified version of x of t , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,73,0,0,758.225,6,7,signalprocessing,the laplace transform reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,78,0,0,800.140,17,18,signalprocessing,and now when we look at this what we observe is that this in fact is the fourier transform of something , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,80,0,0,812.160,8,9,signalprocessing,it's not x of t anymore it's the fourier transform of x of t multiplied by e to the minus sigma t , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,81,0,0,820.730,14,15,signalprocessing,so if we think of these two terms together this integral is just the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,82,0,0,826.930,2,3,signalprocessing,it's the fourier transform of x of t multiplied by an exponential , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,85,0,0,845.380,16,17,signalprocessing,so we have then this additional relationship which tells us that the laplace transform is the fourier transform of an exponentially weighted time function , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,87,0,0,866.000,11,12,signalprocessing,in particular recall that there were issues of convergence with the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,88,0,0,871.840,3,4,signalprocessing,in particular the fourier transform may or may not converge , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,93,0,0,917.190,13,14,signalprocessing,and so the conclusion an important point is that the laplace transform the fourier transform of this product may converge even though the fourier transform of x of t doesn't , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,94,0,0,929.530,11,12,signalprocessing,in other words the laplace transform may converge even when the fourier transform doesn't converge , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,98,0,0,963.100,7,8,signalprocessing,in effect we can apply the inverse fourier transform to this thereby to this account for the exponential factor by bringing it over to the other side , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,106,0,0,1046.329,4,5,signalprocessing,if we take the fourier transform of this exponential , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,110,0,0,1064.680,10,11,signalprocessing,what that really means is that for convergence of the fourier transform this has to be a decaying exponential , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,113,0,0,1081.620,10,11,signalprocessing,applying the laplace transform is the same as taking the fourier transform of x of t times an exponential and the exponent that we would multiply by is e to the minus sigma t , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,114,0,0,1095.710,13,14,signalprocessing,so in effect taking the laplace transform of this is like taking the fourier transform of e to the minus at e to the minus sigma t , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,116,0,0,1122.200,5,6,signalprocessing,but just as in the fourier transform the fourier transform won't converge for any a , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,117,0,0,1130.980,13,14,signalprocessing,now what happens is that the laplace transform will only converge when the fourier transform of this converges , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,123,0,0,1177.430,4,5,signalprocessing,so that essentially the fourier transform of x of t times e to the minus sigma t converges , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,127,0,0,1220.210,2,3,signalprocessing,with the fourier transform either it converged or it didn't converge , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,196,0,0,1809.450,24,25,signalprocessing,the reason for that is that s is sigma plus j omega and convergence of the laplace transform is associated with convergence of the fourier transform of e to the minus sigma t times x of t , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,203,0,0,1869.360,15,16,signalprocessing,now finally we can tie together the region of convergence to the convergence of the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,204,0,0,1877.980,12,13,signalprocessing,in particular since we know that the laplace transform reduces to the fourier transform when the complex variable s is equal to j omega the implication is that if we have the laplace transform and if the laplace transform reduces to the fourier transform when sigma equals zero , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,205,0,0,1904.440,12,13,signalprocessing,in other words when s is equal to j omega then the fourier transform of x of t converging is equivalent to the statement that the laplace transform converges for sigma equal to zero , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,236,0,0,2158.230,4,5,signalprocessing,now recall that the fourier transform converges if the time function has the property that it's absolutely integrable , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,238,0,0,2177.830,3,4,signalprocessing,now here the fourier transform will converge , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,240,0,0,2189.770,6,7,signalprocessing,well the laplace transform is the fourier transform of the time function multiplied by an exponential , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,292,0,0,2746.040,27,28,signalprocessing,well if we have a laplace transform we can in principle get the time function back again by recognizing this relationship between the laplace transform and the fourier transform and using the formal fourier transform expression , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,294,0,0,2767.190,14,15,signalprocessing,but more typically what we would do is what we've done also with the fourier transform which is to use simple laplace transform pairs together with the notion of the partial fraction expansion , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,338,0,0,3152.510,21,22,signalprocessing,and a couple of points to underscore again is the fact that the laplace transform is very closely associated with the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,339,0,0,3162.690,14,15,signalprocessing,and in fact the laplace transform for s equals j omega reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,340,0,0,3169.570,8,9,signalprocessing,but more generally the laplace transform is the fourier transform of x of t with an exponential weighting , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,342,0,0,3185.010,10,11,signalprocessing,there are other exponentials for which that product has a fourier transform that doesn't converge , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,347,0,0,3232.060,5,6,signalprocessing,now just as with the fourier transform the laplace transform has some very important properties , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,4,0,0,56.490,12,13,signalprocessing,last time we introduced the laplace transform as a generalization of the fourier transform and just as a reminder the laplace transform expression as we developed it is this integral very much similar to the fourier transform integral except with a more general complex variable , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,5,0,0,79.210,16,17,signalprocessing,and in fact we developed and talked about the relationship between the laplace transform and the fourier transform , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,86.260,18,19,signalprocessing,in particular the laplace transform with the laplace transform variable s purely imaginary in fact reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,7,0,0,98.970,17,18,signalprocessing,or more generally with the laplace transform variable as a complex number the laplace transform is the fourier transform of the corresponding time function with an exponential weighting , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,140.400,5,6,signalprocessing,now just as with the fourier transform there are a number of properties of the laplace transform that are extremely useful in describing and analyzing signals and systems , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,16,0,0,203.320,20,21,signalprocessing,and as you can see by just setting s equal to j omega in fact this reduces to the corresponding fourier transform property , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,17,0,0,212.740,15,16,signalprocessing,and a third property that we'll make frequent use of is referred to as the convolution property , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,18,0,0,220.390,5,6,signalprocessing,again a generalization of the convolution property for fourier transforms , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,19,0,0,225.700,2,3,signalprocessing,here the convolution property says that the laplace transform of the convolution of two time functions is the product of the associated laplace transforms , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,22,0,0,275.130,25,26,signalprocessing,now the convolution property leads to of course a very important and useful mechanism for dealing with linear time invariant systems very much as the fourier transform did , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,23,0,0,290.330,3,4,signalprocessing,in particular the convolution property tells us that if we have a linear time invariant system the output in the time domain is the convolution of the input and the impulse response , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,26,0,0,324.220,5,6,signalprocessing,in the case of the fourier transform the fourier transform the impulse response we refer to as the frequency response , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,31,0,0,385.390,12,13,signalprocessing,and that in fact is the same condition for convergence of the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,34,0,0,405.710,11,12,signalprocessing,which of course is where the laplace transform reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,53,0,0,554.870,8,9,signalprocessing,and if we apply to this equation the differentiation property then the derivative the laplace transform of the derivative is s times the laplace transform of the time function , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,56,0,0,590.620,4,5,signalprocessing,we know from the convolution property that this laplace transform is the system function times x of s , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,115,0,0,1129.720,7,8,signalprocessing,and that corresponds to looking at the fourier transform of the impulse response which is the laplace transform on the j omega axis , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,189,0,0,1972.060,5,6,signalprocessing,and of course from the convolution property the overall system function is the product of the individual system functions , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,4,0,0,56.890,14,15,signalprocessing,in the last several lectures we've talked about a generalization of the continuous time fourier transform and a very similar strategy also applies to discrete time and that's what we want to begin to deal with in today's lecture , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,5,0,0,72.750,10,11,signalprocessing,so what we want to talk about is generalizing the fourier transform and what this will lead to in discrete time is a notion referred to as the z transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,84.380,10,11,signalprocessing,now just as in continuous time in discrete time the fourier transform corresponded to a representation of a sequence as a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,12,0,0,133.820,22,23,signalprocessing,and the change in complex amplitude which corresponds to the frequency response in fact is what led to the definition of the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,13,0,0,145.640,5,6,signalprocessing,in particular it is the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,14,0,0,151.610,25,26,signalprocessing,well that set of notions is more or less identical to the way we motivated the laplace transform in the continuous time case in the fourier transform in the continuous time case , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,37,0,0,461.760,17,18,signalprocessing,that same argument is also the kind of argument that we use to lead us into the fourier transform originally , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,38,0,0,471.200,21,22,signalprocessing,and once again what you would expect is that the z transform has a very close and important relationship to the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,40,0,0,486.730,10,11,signalprocessing,identical to the relationship between the laplace transform and the fourier transform in continuous time , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,42,0,0,498.650,12,13,signalprocessing,first of all what we recognize is that if we compare the fourier transform expression for a sequence and the z transform expression for the same sequence that they involve essentially the same operations , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,44,0,0,536.900,20,21,signalprocessing,said another way the z transform when z is e to the j omega is going to reduce to the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,45,0,0,547.900,18,19,signalprocessing,so we have a relationship like the one again that we had between the laplace transform and the fourier transform in continuous time , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,46,0,0,556.710,20,21,signalprocessing,namely that for a certain set of values of the complex variable the transform the z transform reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,49,0,0,592.050,6,7,signalprocessing,then this is equal to the fourier transform of the sequence , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,50,0,0,597.290,15,16,signalprocessing,so the z transform for z equal to e to the j omega is the fourier transform and so this then corresponds to x of omega , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,51,0,0,611.290,2,3,signalprocessing,namely the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,57,0,0,656.240,4,5,signalprocessing,well in fact the fourier transform is a function of omega , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,59,0,0,662.620,17,18,signalprocessing,and now what we can see is that given the fact that we want to generalize the fourier transform to the z transform it's convenient now to use as notation for the fourier transform x of z with z equal to e to the j omega , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,61,0,0,686.640,14,15,signalprocessing,so just summarizing that our new notation is that the independent variable on the fourier transform is now going to be expressed as e to the j omega rather than as omega , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,64,0,0,718.440,26,27,signalprocessing,but let me draw your attention to the fact that in the laplace transform the independent variable that we ended up with in talking about the fourier transform is different than what we're ending up with here , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,67,0,0,758.100,7,8,signalprocessing,so we have one relationship between the fourier transform and the z transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,68,0,0,763.060,18,19,signalprocessing,namely the fact that for the magnitude of z equal to one the z transform reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,69,0,0,773.390,23,24,signalprocessing,now in the laplace transform we also had another important relationship and observation which was the fact that the laplace transform was the fourier transform of x of t modified , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,73,0,0,805.430,23,24,signalprocessing,in particular in addition to the fact that the z transform for z equal to e to the j omega reduces to the fourier transform we'll see that the z transform for other values of z is the fourier transform of the sequence with an exponential weighting , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,79,0,0,875.530,26,27,signalprocessing,well what this says is that the z transform which is this at z equal to r e to the j omega is in fact the fourier transform of what , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,80,0,0,893.200,2,3,signalprocessing,it's the fourier transform of x of n multiplied by r to the minus n , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,82,0,0,906.200,11,12,signalprocessing,and in continuous time we had the laplace transform as the fourier transform of x of t e to the minus sigma t , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,83,0,0,915.710,4,5,signalprocessing,here we have the fourier transform of x of n r to the minus n , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,97,0,0,1016.460,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier transform as we've seen in earlier lectures is one over one minus a e to the minus j omega , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,99,0,0,1028.540,6,7,signalprocessing,in particular for convergence of the fourier transform we would require absolute summability of the original sequence , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,101,0,0,1042.250,2,3,signalprocessing,so the fourier transform is this provided that the magnitude of a is less than one , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,102,0,0,1048.140,4,5,signalprocessing,and what is the fourier transform if the magnitude of a is not less than one , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,112,0,0,1115.710,6,7,signalprocessing,now the z transform is the fourier transform of the sequence a to the n times r to the minus n , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,113,0,0,1128.090,54,55,signalprocessing,and this statement about the z transform converging is exactly identical to the statement that what we're requiring is that the magnitude of a times r to the minus one be less than one where this represents the exponential factor that we have that in effect is applied to the sequence so that the fourier transform becomes the z transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,114,0,0,1163.430,26,27,signalprocessing,and so if we put this condition we can interpret this condition in exactly the same way that we interpret the condition on convergence of the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,134,0,0,1379.750,22,23,signalprocessing,recall that in the discussion that we just came from when we talked about the relationship between the z transform and the fourier transform the z transform reduces to the fourier transform when the magnitude of z is equal to one , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,137,0,0,1408.880,17,18,signalprocessing,and so it's on this contour in the z plane that the z transform reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,139,0,0,1423.550,31,32,signalprocessing,just again to emphasize the relationships and differences with continuous time with the laplace transform it's the behavior in the s plane on the j omega axis that corresponds to the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,140,0,0,1438.440,15,16,signalprocessing,here it's the behavior on the unit circle where the z transform corresponds to the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,162,0,0,1655.240,12,13,signalprocessing,and so in fact that would say that the sequence has a fourier transform that converges , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,166,0,0,1679.570,16,17,signalprocessing,and so this example with the magnitude of a less than one does not have a fourier transform that converges , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,167,0,0,1687.950,13,14,signalprocessing,well assuming that the magnitude of a is less than one and the fourier transform converges we can in fact look at the fourier transform by observing what happens as we go around the unit circle , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,172,0,0,1744.200,4,5,signalprocessing,and to observe the fourier transform we would observe how those vectors change in length as we move around the unit circle , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,173,0,0,1755.030,26,27,signalprocessing,and as we move around the unit circle what we would trace out in terms of the ratio of the lengths of those vectors is the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,178,0,0,1794.810,8,9,signalprocessing,and so here if we assumed that the fourier transform of the associated sequence converged then again we would look at the behavior of this as we moved around the unit circle , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,180,0,0,1819.060,3,4,signalprocessing,i'm sorry the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,181,0,0,1821.220,2,3,signalprocessing,so the fourier transform magnitude would consist of the ratio of the lengths of the zero vectors divided by the lengths of the pole vectors , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,186,0,0,1865.940,8,9,signalprocessing,so in fact if we looked at the fourier transform associated with this pole zero pattern if this was for example represented the z transform of the impulse response or a linear time invariant system the corresponding frequency response would be what i plotted out below , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,189,0,0,1905.950,11,12,signalprocessing,so as we sweep past this pole then in fact this fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,196,0,0,1958.640,4,5,signalprocessing,and to generate the fourier transform we want to look at the behavior of the pole and zero vectors as we move around the unit circle , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,199,0,0,1978.250,5,6,signalprocessing,and the magnitude of the fourier transform will be as we discussed the magnitude of the length of the zero vector is divided by the magnitude of the length of the pole vectors , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,200,0,0,1990.580,5,6,signalprocessing,shown below will be the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,201,0,0,1994.760,4,5,signalprocessing,and we have the fourier transform displayed here from zero to two pi rather than from minus pi to pi as it was displayed in the transparency , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,202,0,0,2005.640,6,7,signalprocessing,because of the periodicity of the fourier transform both of those are equivalent , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,204,0,0,2020.590,9,10,signalprocessing,and that of course generates a change in the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,206,0,0,2043.370,7,8,signalprocessing,and that generates a residence in the fourier transform very similar to what we saw in continuous time , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,208,0,0,2062.050,8,9,signalprocessing,and so in fact the magnitude of the fourier transform will decrease , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,213,0,0,2104.960,7,8,signalprocessing,and because of the symmetry in the fourier transform what we will see in the magnitude is identical to what we would see if we swept from omega equal to pi back clockwise to omega equals zero , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,218,0,0,2159.400,7,8,signalprocessing,now finally let's also look at the fourier transform associated with the first order example that we discussed earlier in the lecture , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,219,0,0,2171.370,10,11,signalprocessing,and so what we'll want to look at is the fourier transform as the pole and zero vectors change , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,220,0,0,2178.990,3,4,signalprocessing,once again the fourier transform will be displayed on a scale from zero to two pi a frequency scale from zero to two pi rather than minus pi to pi , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,228,0,0,2241.890,9,10,signalprocessing,and so that means that the magnitude of the fourier transform will decrease monotonically until we get past omega equal to pi , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,231,0,0,2281.320,8,9,signalprocessing,since because of the symmetry again of the fourier transform magnitude sweeping from pi to two pi is going to be equivalent with regard to the magnitude to sweeping from pi back to zero , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,232,0,0,2297.400,17,18,signalprocessing,and so now the pole vector begins to decrease in length and correspondingly the magnitude of the fourier transform will increase , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,234,0,0,2318.020,19,20,signalprocessing,and obviously if we continue to sweep around again we would simply trace out other periods associated with the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,236,0,0,2342.760,26,27,signalprocessing,and of course you can see that because the circle is periodic as we go around and around of course what we'll get is a periodic fourier transform which is the way fourier transforms are supposed to be , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,249,0,0,2496.420,12,13,signalprocessing,furthermore as we've already talked about and exploited actually convergence of the fourier transform is equivalent to the statement that the region of convergence includes the unit circle in the z plane , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,252,0,0,2532.550,18,19,signalprocessing,if we have a finite duration sequence so that the sequence is absolutely summable and therefore has a fourier transform that converges then because of the fact that it's zero outside some interval i can multiply it by an exponentially decaying sequence or by an exponentially growing sequence , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,274,0,0,2771.130,10,11,signalprocessing,in other words it's the only one for which the fourier transform converges , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,281,0,0,2819.350,20,21,signalprocessing,but basically what we can use to develop a formal expression is the fact that the z transform is the fourier transform of the sequence exponentially weighted , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,301,0,0,3041.320,31,32,signalprocessing,the principal difference really being that with the laplace transform it was the j omega axis in the s plane that we focused attention on when we were thinking about the fourier transform , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,5,0,0,61.240,16,17,signalprocessing,as with the laplace transform in continuous time we developed it as a generalization of the fourier transform , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,8,0,0,87.660,14,15,signalprocessing,but we focused in particular on the relationship between the z transform and the fourier transform pointing out first of all that the z transform when we choose the magnitude of z equal to one so the magnitude of z of the form e to the j omega just simply reduces to the fourier transform of the sequence , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,10,0,0,122.640,34,35,signalprocessing,in the discrete time z transform case we expressed that complex number in polar form as r e to the j omega and recognize that the z transform expression in fact corresponds to the fourier transform of the sequence exponentially weighted , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,17,0,0,239.780,2,3,signalprocessing,then the convolution property for which the z transform of a convolution of sequences is the product of the associated z transforms , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,20,0,0,274.240,2,3,signalprocessing,with the convolution property the convolution property as in continuous time of course provides a mechanism for dealing with linear time invariant systems , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,22,0,0,302.770,3,4,signalprocessing,because of the convolution property associated with the z transform the z transform of the output is the z transform of the input times the z transform of the impulse response , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,23,0,0,317.580,25,26,signalprocessing,again very much the same as what we had in continuous time and also what we had in the context of the discussion with the fourier transform , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,24,0,0,329.410,12,13,signalprocessing,in fact because of the relationship between the z transform and the fourier transform the z transform of the impulse response evaluated on the unit circle in other words for the magnitude of z equal to one in fact corresponds to the frequency response of the system , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,26,0,0,363.130,2,3,signalprocessing,now the convolution property and these other properties as i indicated we will find useful in talking about systems which are described by linear constant coefficient difference equations and in fact we'll do that shortly , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,32,0,0,451.450,6,7,signalprocessing,furthermore when we talked about the fourier transform , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,33,0,0,455.640,1,2,signalprocessing,the fourier transform of a sequence converges if the sequence is absolutely summable , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,34,0,0,464.500,17,18,signalprocessing,so in fact the condition for stability of a system and the condition for convergence of the fourier transform of its impulse response are the same condition namely absolute summability , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,36,0,0,482.750,7,8,signalprocessing,what it means is that if the fourier transform converges , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,39,0,0,505.210,9,10,signalprocessing,in other words the impulse response must have a fourier transform that converges , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,54,0,0,696.930,21,22,signalprocessing,the three basic properties that play a key role in that discussion are the linearity property the shifting property and the convolution property , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,62,0,0,786.100,6,7,signalprocessing,now what we know from the convolution property is that for a system the z transform of the output is the system function times the z transform of the input , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,97,0,0,1148.500,5,6,signalprocessing,we in fact evaluated the fourier transform associated with this pole zero pattern last time , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,140,0,0,1656.560,30,31,signalprocessing,now what we can use are the properties of the laplace transform and the z transform to see what this means in terms of a mapping in particular using the differentiation property for laplace transforms , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,175,0,0,2114.030,16,17,signalprocessing,remembering the issues of sampling the discrete time frequency response then since the frequency responses the fourier transform of the impulse response is related to the continuous time impulse response as i indicate here what this says is that it is the superposition of replications of the continuous time frequency response linearly scaled in frequency and shifted and added to each other , Lecture25FeedbackMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,165,0,0,1553.060,14,15,signalprocessing,and we want to look at frequency response so we'll look specifically at the fourier transform , Lecture25FeedbackMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,166,0,0,1558.620,16,17,signalprocessing,and of course the frequency response of the overall system is the frequency response of the fourier transform of the output divided by the input , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,108,0,0,1052.350,9,10,signalprocessing,well we can answer that by looking at the convolution property , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,9,0,0,129.380,12,13,signalprocessing,later on in the course when we've developed the concept of the fourier transform after that the laplace transform we'll see some very efficient and useful ways of generating solutions both for differential and difference equations , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,272,0,0,2775.560,13,14,signalprocessing,and beginning with the next set of lectures we'll be talking about the fourier transform and much later in the course what's referred to as the laplace transform for continuous time and the z transform for discrete time , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,273,0,0,2790.070,8,9,signalprocessing,and what we'll see is that with the fourier transform and later with the laplace and z transform we'll have a number of efficient and very useful ways of generating the solution for differential and difference equations under the assumption that the system is causal linear and time invariant , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,54,0,0,673.950,15,16,signalprocessing,and what that leads to is a representation of periodic signals through what's called the fourier series , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,55,0,0,682.360,15,16,signalprocessing,following that we'll turn our attention to non periodic or as i refer to it aperiodic signals , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,56,0,0,689.770,19,20,signalprocessing,and the representation that's developed in terms of linear combinations of complex exponentials is what's referred to as the fourier transform , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,57,0,0,701.240,14,15,signalprocessing,so the first thing we want to deal with are periodic signals and the fourier series , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,58,0,0,709.690,10,11,signalprocessing,so what we're talking about then is the continuous time fourier series , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,59,0,0,717.110,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier series is a representation for periodic continuous time signals , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,73,0,0,849.140,3,4,signalprocessing,now what the fourier series says and we'll justify this bit by bit as the discussion goes on what the fourier series says and in fact what fourier said which was essentially his brilliant insight is that if i have a very general periodic signal i can represent it as a linear combination of these harmonically related complex exponentials , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,75,0,0,881.950,11,12,signalprocessing,and this summation is what will be referred to as the fourier series , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,77,0,0,902.010,17,18,signalprocessing,one is assuming that our periodic signal can be represented this way how do we determine the fourier series coefficients as they're referred to a k , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,82,0,0,935.430,4,5,signalprocessing,this representation of the fourier series which i've repeated again here is what's referred to as the complex exponential form of the fourier series , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,85,0,0,976.700,10,11,signalprocessing,now that complex exponential form is one representation for the fourier series , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,87,0,0,989.300,29,30,signalprocessing,there is another representation that perhaps you've come across previously and that in a variety of other contexts is typically used which is called the trigonometric form for the fourier series , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,89,0,0,1007.240,66,67,signalprocessing,essentially we can get to the trigonometric form from the complex exponential form by recognizing that if we express the complex coefficient in polar form or in rectangular form and expand the complex exponential term out in terms of cosine plus j sine using just simply euler's relation then we will end up with a representation for the periodic signal or a re expression of the fourier series expression that we had previously either in the form that i indicate here where now the periodic signal is expressed in terms of a summation of cosines with appropriate amplitude and phase , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,93,0,0,1096.590,11,12,signalprocessing,however let's look back and the complex exponential form for the fourier series at the top of the board , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,97,0,0,1143.710,5,6,signalprocessing,okay now we have the fourier series representation as i've indicated here , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,108,0,0,1264.400,20,21,signalprocessing,okay well the next step in developing the expression for the coefficient a k is to refer back to the fourier series expression which was that x t is equal to the sum of a k e j k omega zero t , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,112,0,0,1336.140,6,7,signalprocessing,so multiplying both sides of the fourier series and then doing the integration leads us after the appropriate manipulation to the expression that i have up here , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,116,0,0,1381.020,31,32,signalprocessing,and so finally we have what i indicate here taking t zero and moving it over to the other side of the equation that then tells us how we determine the fourier series coefficients a n or a k , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,117,0,0,1400.540,28,29,signalprocessing,so that in effect then is what we refer to as the analysis equation the equation that begins with x t and tells us how to get the fourier series coefficients , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,118,0,0,1414.260,6,7,signalprocessing,what i'll refer to as the fourier series synthesis equation is the equation that tells us how to build x t out of these complex exponentials , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,121,0,0,1442.210,13,14,signalprocessing,so we in effect have gone through the issue of assuming that a fourier series representation is in fact valid how we get the coefficients , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,124,0,0,1469.250,19,20,signalprocessing,but let's first look at just some examples in which we take a signal assume that it has the fourier series representation and see what the fourier series coefficients look like , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,131,0,0,1547.110,5,6,signalprocessing,and so i've expressed the fourier series coefficients as this integral that's from t zero point two to zero , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,139,0,0,1602.830,15,16,signalprocessing,for k equal to zero we can go back to the basic expression for the fourier series which is one t zero the integral over a period x t e j k omega zero t dt , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,144,0,0,1660.050,5,6,signalprocessing,now let's look at these fourier series coefficients on a bar graph , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,146,0,0,1670.610,4,5,signalprocessing,the expression for the fourier series coefficients we just developed , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,151,0,0,1699.890,6,7,signalprocessing,one is the fact that the fourier series coefficients for this example are purely imaginary , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,152,0,0,1709.870,5,6,signalprocessing,a second is that the fourier series coefficients for this example are an odd sequence , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,155,0,0,1728.660,14,15,signalprocessing,and what that results in when you look at the trigonometric form of the fourier series is that in fact those conditions if you put the terms all together lead you to a trigonometric representation which involves only sine terms in other words no cosine terms , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,158,0,0,1767.530,14,15,signalprocessing,so what this says is that for the antisymmetric square wave in effect the fourier series is a sine series , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,163,0,0,1811.720,9,10,signalprocessing,in other words for even values of k the fourier series coefficients are zero , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,173,0,0,1880.630,6,7,signalprocessing,so if we look at the fourier series coefficients for this , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,175,0,0,1891.350,6,7,signalprocessing,here i've plotted pi times the fourier series coefficients , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,206,0,0,2167.150,14,15,signalprocessing,so this is the square wave that we want to build up through the fourier series as a sum of sinusoids , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,212,0,0,2223.230,4,5,signalprocessing,here we show the fourier series with k two and there's no change , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,223,0,0,2298.530,39,40,signalprocessing,and notice that it is the higher order terms that tend to build up the discontinuity corresponding to the notion that the discontinuity or sharp edges in a signal in fact are represented through the higher frequencies in the fourier series , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,227,0,0,2340.180,7,8,signalprocessing,and it's an inherent part of the fourier series representation at discontinuities , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,236,0,0,2428.590,18,19,signalprocessing,and in fact something that will stand out more and more as we go through our discussion of fourier series and fourier transforms is that general statement that it's the low frequency terms that represent the broad time behavior and it's the high frequency terms that are used to build up the sharp transitions in the time domain , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,237,0,0,2460.060,17,18,signalprocessing,now we need to get a little more precise about the question of how in fact the fourier series or when the fourier series represents the functions that we're talking about and in what sense they represent them , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,248,0,0,2549.770,15,16,signalprocessing,but it relates to what it's referred to as the issue of convergence of the fourier series , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,249,0,0,2557.010,5,6,signalprocessing,and the convergence of the fourier series the bottom line on it the kind of end statement can be made in several ways , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,250,0,0,2567.710,8,9,signalprocessing,one statement related to the convergence of the fourier series is the following , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,268,0,0,2775.310,10,11,signalprocessing,and we want to again show the buildup of the fourier series , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,284,0,0,2895.070,13,14,signalprocessing,and now what we'll do is increase the number of terms in the fourier series and watch the energy in the error decreasing always decreasing of course on the inclusion of the odd numbered terms and not on the inclusion of the even numbered terms because of the fact that it's an odd harmonic function , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,285,0,0,2918.030,15,16,signalprocessing,now the energy in the error asymptotically will approach zero although point by point the fourier series will never be equal to the square wave , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,287,0,0,2946.190,11,12,signalprocessing,so what we've seen then is a quick look at the fourier series representation of periodic signals , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,289,0,0,2968.080,15,16,signalprocessing,and so our next step will be to move toward a representation of nonperiodic or aperiodic signals , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,292,0,0,2992.810,37,38,signalprocessing,the basic strategy with an aperiodic signal is to think of representing this aperiodic signal as a linear combination of complex exponentials by the simple trick of periodically replicating this signal generating a periodic signal using a fourier series representation for that periodic signal and then simply letting the period go to infinity , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,294,0,0,3035.520,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier series representation then becomes what we'll refer to the fourier transform , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,296,0,0,3050.140,17,18,signalprocessing,in the next lecture we'll develop this a little more carefully and more fully moving from the fourier series which we've used for periodic signals to develop the fourier transform which will then be representation for aperiodic signals , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,4,0,0,65.560,14,15,signalprocessing,and for the class of periodic signals specifically what this led to was the fourier series representation for periodic signals , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,79.110,8,9,signalprocessing,for periodic signals we had the continuous time fourier series where we built the periodic signal out of a linear combination of harmonically related complex exponentials , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,0,0,123.090,6,7,signalprocessing,then the other side of the fourier series is what i referred to as the analysis equation , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,130.380,14,15,signalprocessing,and the analysis equation was the equation that told us how we get the fourier series coefficients from x of t , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,139.110,11,12,signalprocessing,and so this equation together with the synthesis equation represent the fourier series description for periodic signals , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,19,0,0,232.490,9,10,signalprocessing,so the basic idea then is to use the fourier series to represent the periodic signal and then examine the fourier series expression as we let the period go to infinity , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,22,0,0,262.079,12,13,signalprocessing,and what we want to inquire into is what happens to the fourier series expression for this as we let the period go to infinity , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,23,0,0,271.750,4,5,signalprocessing,as that happens whatever fourier series representation we end up with will correspond also to a representation for this aperiodic signal , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,25,0,0,284.220,1,2,signalprocessing,the fourier series synthesis expression for the periodic signal expresses x tilde of t the periodic signal as a linear combination of harmonically related complex exponentials with the fundamental frequency omega zero equaled to two pi divided by the period , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,30,0,0,335.510,5,6,signalprocessing,so this tells us the fourier series coefficients in terms of x of t , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,32,0,0,374.830,29,30,signalprocessing,said another way let's define a function as i've indicated here which is this integral where we may think of omega as being a continuous variable and then the fourier series coefficients correspond to substituting for omega k omega zero , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,34,0,0,411.250,10,11,signalprocessing,and this in fact then is an envelope of the fourier series coefficients , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,36,0,0,430.540,10,11,signalprocessing,so this in effect tells us how to get the fourier series coefficients of the periodic signal in terms of samples of an envelope , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,46,0,0,542.740,11,12,signalprocessing,so the resulting equation that we get out of the original fourier series synthesis equation is the equation that i indicate down here x of t synthesized in terms of this integral which is what the fourier series approaches as omega zero goes to zero , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,48,0,0,576.900,6,7,signalprocessing,and we have then the corresponding fourier transform analysis equation which tells us how we arrive at that envelope in terms of x of t , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,51,0,0,634.160,6,7,signalprocessing,and this periodic signal has a fourier series and we express the fourier series coefficients of this as samples of an envelope function , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,53,0,0,651.520,7,8,signalprocessing,so this is the envelope of the fourier series coefficients , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,54,0,0,655.390,14,15,signalprocessing,for example if the period t zero was four times t one then the fourier series coefficients that we would end up with is this set of samples of the envelope , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,55,0,0,670.480,8,9,signalprocessing,if instead we doubled that period then the fourier series coefficients that we end up with are more finely spaced , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,59,0,0,718.440,11,12,signalprocessing,so here we have the square wave and below it the fourier series coefficients , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,60,0,0,723.010,8,9,signalprocessing,and we now want to look at the fourier series coefficients as the period of the square wave starts to increase , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,62,0,0,744.100,7,8,signalprocessing,and in fact the envelope of the fourier series coefficients is shown in the bottom and to emphasize in fact that it is the envelope let's superimpose it on top of the fourier series coefficients that we've generated so far , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,64,0,0,768.710,11,12,signalprocessing,now let's increase the period even further and we'll see the fourier series coefficients fill in under that envelope function even more , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,68,0,0,808.030,22,23,signalprocessing,let's once again plot the envelope function and again to emphasize that we've generated samples of that let's superimpose that on the fourier series coefficients , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,69,0,0,826.300,8,9,signalprocessing,so what we have then is now our fourier transform representation the continuous time fourier transform with the synthesis equation expressed as an integral as i've indicated here and this integral is what the fourier series sum went to as we let the period go to infinity or the frequency go to zero , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,71,0,0,859.080,11,12,signalprocessing,the analysis equation being the expression for the envelope of the fourier series coefficients for the periodically replicated signal , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,72,0,0,870.620,12,13,signalprocessing,and in shorthand notation we would think of x of t and fourier transform as a pair as i've indicated here , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,73,0,0,880.380,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier transform as we'll emphasize in several examples and certainly as is consistent with the fourier series is a complex valued function even when x of t is real , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,74,0,0,895.730,11,12,signalprocessing,so with x of t real we end up with a fourier transform which is a complex function , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,75,0,0,901.770,3,4,signalprocessing,just as the fourier series coefficients were complex for a real value time function , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,76,0,0,908.250,7,8,signalprocessing,so we could alternatively as with the fourier series , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,77,0,0,912.420,2,3,signalprocessing,express the fourier transform in terms of it's real part and imaginary part or alternatively in terms of its magnitude and its angle , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,78,0,0,928.270,14,15,signalprocessing,all right now let's look at an example of a time function in its fourier transform , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,82,0,0,949.520,1,2,signalprocessing,it's fourier transform is the integral from minus infinity to plus infinity x of t e to the minus j omega t dt , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,86,0,0,998.870,9,10,signalprocessing,and so what we have finally is for the fourier transform expression one over a plus j omega , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,87,0,0,1012.700,2,3,signalprocessing,now this fourier transform as i indicated is a complex valued function , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,89,0,0,1024.210,6,7,signalprocessing,we have the expression for the fourier transform pair e to the minus a t times , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,90,0,0,1032.839,2,3,signalprocessing,and its fourier transform is one over a plus j omega , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,92,0,0,1042.609,42,43,signalprocessing,now in the expression that we just worked out if a is less than zero in fact the expression doesn't converge e to the minus a t for a negative as t goes to infinity blows up and so in fact the fourier transform doesn't converge except for the case where a is greater than zero and in fact there is a more detailed discussion of convergence issues in the text , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,93,0,0,1074.990,10,11,signalprocessing,the convergence issues are very much the same for the fourier transform as they are for the fourier series , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,94,0,0,1080.860,10,11,signalprocessing,and in fact that's not surprising because we developed the fourier transform out of a consideration of the fourier series , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,96,0,0,1102.290,6,7,signalprocessing,ok now if we plot the fourier transform let's first consider the shape of the time function , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,99,0,0,1122.920,4,5,signalprocessing,the magnitude of the fourier transform is as i indicate here and the phase below it , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,100,0,0,1133.970,17,18,signalprocessing,and there are a number of things we can see about the magnitude and phase of the fourier transform for this example which in fact we'll see in the next lecture are properties that apply more generally , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,101,0,0,1150.210,6,7,signalprocessing,for example the fact that the fourier transform magnitude is an even function of frequency and the phase is an odd function of frequency , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,103,0,0,1172.830,8,9,signalprocessing,in other words in our expression for the fourier transform it requires both omega positive and omega negative , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,104,0,0,1183.920,12,13,signalprocessing,this of course was exactly the same in the case of the fourier series , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,107,0,0,1214.700,14,15,signalprocessing,so it's important to keep in mind that in our case both with the fourier series and the fourier transform we deal and require both positive and negative frequencies in order to build our signals , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,109,0,0,1240.360,7,8,signalprocessing,and that's one graphical representation for the fourier transform that we'll typically use , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,120,0,0,1330.190,10,11,signalprocessing,and i indicated that there is a symmetry to the fourier transform and so in fact we can infer from this particular picture what it looks like for the negative frequencies as well as for the positive frequencies , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,121,0,0,1349.560,10,11,signalprocessing,now what we've done so far is to develop the fourier transform on the basis the fourier transform of an aperiodic signal on the basis of periodically repeating it and recognizing that the fourier series coefficients are samples of an envelope and that these become more finely spaced as frequency increases , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,122,0,0,1379.990,26,27,signalprocessing,and in fact we can go back to our original equation in which we developed an envelope function and what we had indicated is that the fourier series coefficients were samples of this envelope , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,123,0,0,1402.920,7,8,signalprocessing,we then defined this envelope as the fourier transform of this aperiodic signal , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,125,0,0,1424.810,22,23,signalprocessing,now suppose that we have instead a periodic signal are there in fact some statements that we can make about how the fourier series coefficients of that are related to the fourier transform of something , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,127,0,0,1447.390,9,10,signalprocessing,what this statement says is that in fact the fourier series coefficients are samples of the fourier transform of one period , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,128,0,0,1459.180,14,15,signalprocessing,so if we now consider a periodic signal we can in fact get the fourier series coefficients of that periodic signal by considering the fourier transform of one period , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,129,0,0,1478.630,4,5,signalprocessing,said another way the fourier series coefficients are proportional to samples of the fourier transform of one period , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,130,0,0,1487.670,10,11,signalprocessing,so if we consider this a periodic signal computed as fourier transform and selected these samples that i indicate here namely samples equally spaced in omega by integer multiples of omega zero then in fact those would be the fourier series coefficients , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,132,0,0,1527.190,25,26,signalprocessing,and now in this case we could argue that if in fact it was the periodic signal that we started with we could get the fourier series coefficients of that by thinking about the fourier transform of one period which i indicate here , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,133,0,0,1549.590,3,4,signalprocessing,and then the fourier series coefficients of the periodic signal in fact are the appropriate set of samples of this envelope , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,134,0,0,1564.710,10,11,signalprocessing,all right now we have a way of getting the fourier series coefficients from the fourier transform of one period , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,135,0,0,1574.930,4,5,signalprocessing,we originally derived the fourier transform of one period from the fourier series , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,136,0,0,1581.420,12,13,signalprocessing,what would in fact be nice is if we could incorporate the fourier series and the fourier transform within a common framework , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,138,0,0,1598.040,21,22,signalprocessing,essentially if we consider what the equation for the synthesis looks like in both cases we can in effect define a fourier transform for the periodic signal which we know is represented by its fourier series coefficients , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,139,0,0,1619.360,4,5,signalprocessing,we can define a fourier transform and the definition of the fourier transform is as an impulse train where the coefficients in the impulse train are proportional with a proportionality factor of two pi for a more or less a bookkeeping reason proportional to the fourier series coefficients , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,141,0,0,1650.860,9,10,signalprocessing,specifically here is then the synthesis equation for the fourier transform if we substitute this definition for the fourier transform of the periodic signal into this expression then when we do the appropriate bookkeeping and interchange the order of summation and integration the impulse integrates out to the exponential factor that we want , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,143,0,0,1685.820,3,4,signalprocessing,we have the fourier series coefficients , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,144,0,0,1687.990,24,25,signalprocessing,the two pis take care of each other and what we're left with is the synthesis equation for aperiodic signal in terms of the fourier transform or in terms of its fourier series coefficients , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,146,0,0,1710.230,28,29,signalprocessing,if we consider the example of a symmetric square wave then in effect what we're saying is that for this symmetric square wave this has a set of fourier series coefficients which we worked out previously and which i indicate on this figure with a bar graph , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,147,0,0,1732.440,10,11,signalprocessing,and really all that we're saying is that whereas these fourier series coefficients are indexed on an integer variable k and bars not impulses , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,148,0,0,1744.790,7,8,signalprocessing,if we simply redefine or define the fourier transform of the periodic signal as an impulse train where the weights of the impulses are two pi times the corresponding fourier series coefficients then this in fact is what we would use as the fourier transform of the periodic signal , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,150,0,0,1782.180,31,32,signalprocessing,so let me just try to summarize the various relationships and steps that we've gone through keeping in mind that one of our objectives was first to develop a representation for aperiodic signals and then attempt to incorporate within one framework both periodic and aperiodic signals , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,156,0,0,1841.500,9,10,signalprocessing,x tilde of t the periodic signal has a fourier series , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,157,0,0,1845.550,12,13,signalprocessing,and as its period increases that approaches the aperiodic signal and the fourier series of that approaches the fourier transform of the original aperiodic signal , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,159,0,0,1865.700,16,17,signalprocessing,now the second thing that we recognize is that once we have the concept of the fourier transform we can in fact relate the fourier series coefficients to the fourier transform of one period , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,160,0,0,1882.210,23,24,signalprocessing,so the second statement that we made was that if in fact we're trying to represent a periodic signal we can get the fourier series coefficients of that by computing the fourier transform of one period and then samples of that fourier transform are in fact the fourier series coefficients for the periodic signal , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,161,0,0,1913.210,16,17,signalprocessing,then the third step that we took was to inquire as to whether there is a fourier transform that can appropriately be defined for the periodic signal and the mechanism for doing that was to recognize that if we simply defined the fourier transform of the periodic signal as an impulse train where the impulse heights or areas were proportional to the fourier series coefficients then in fact the fourier transform synthesis equation reduced to the fourier series synthesis equation , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,163,0,0,1957.960,1,2,signalprocessing,the fourier transform of that periodic signal defined as an impulse train where the heights or areas of the impulses are proportional to the fourier series coefficients provides us with a mechanism for combining it together the concepts or notation of the fourier series and fourier transform , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,164,0,0,1980.900,27,28,signalprocessing,so if we just took a very simple example here is an example in which we have an aperiodic signal which is just an impulse and its fourier transform is just a constant , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,167,0,0,2012.300,1,2,signalprocessing,the fourier transform of this is a constant , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,168,0,0,2015.720,6,7,signalprocessing,and this of course has a fourier series representation , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,169,0,0,2018.970,2,3,signalprocessing,so the fourier transform of the original impulse is just a constant , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,170,0,0,2026.170,1,2,signalprocessing,the fourier transform of the periodic signal is an impulse train where the heights of the impulses are proportional to the fourier series coefficients , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,171,0,0,2038.830,9,10,signalprocessing,and of course we could previously have computed the fourier series coefficients for that impulse train and those fourier series coefficients are as i've shown here , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,173,0,0,2059.199,15,16,signalprocessing,and both of these simply represent samples of what we have above which is the fourier transform of the original aperiodic signal , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,174,0,0,2075.179,22,23,signalprocessing,once again i suspect that kind of moving back and forth and trying to straighten out when we're talking about periodic and aperiodic signals may require a little mental gymnastics initially , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,175,0,0,2088.810,21,22,signalprocessing,basically what we've tried to do is incorporate within one framework a representation for both aperiodic and periodic signals and the fourier transform provides us with a mechanism to do that , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,176,0,0,2104.410,13,14,signalprocessing,in the next lecture i'll continue with the discussion of the continuous time fourier transform in particular focusing on a number of its properties some of which we've already seen namely the symmetry properties , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,177,0,0,2118.000,13,14,signalprocessing,we'll see lots of other properties that relate of course both to the fourier transform and to the fourier series , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,4,0,0,64.440,5,6,signalprocessing,and this led to the fourier series representation in the periodic case and it led to the fourier transform representation in the aperiodic case , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,5,0,0,74.950,11,12,signalprocessing,and then in fact what we did was to incorporate the fourier series within the framework of the fourier transform , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,85.480,12,13,signalprocessing,what i'd like to do in today's lecture is look at the fourier transform more closely in particular with regard to some of its properties , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,7,0,0,95.050,15,16,signalprocessing,so let me begin by reminding you of the analysis and synthesis equations for the fourier transform as i've summarized them here , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,127.970,25,26,signalprocessing,so essentially in the decomposition of x of t as a linear combination of complex exponentials the complex amplitudes of those are in effect the fourier transform scaled by the differential and scaled by one over two pi , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,146.670,6,7,signalprocessing,as i indicated last time the fourier transform is a complex function of frequency , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,12,0,0,155.810,14,15,signalprocessing,and in particular the complex function of frequency has an important and very useful symmetry property , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,13,0,0,164.770,4,5,signalprocessing,the symmetry of the fourier transform when x of t is real is what is referred to as conjugate symmetric , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,16,0,0,184.930,16,17,signalprocessing,and a consequence of that if we think in terms of the real part of the fourier transform the real part is an even function of frequency and the magnitude is an even function of frequency , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,18,0,0,211.170,25,26,signalprocessing,so we have this symmetry relationship that for x of t real if we think of either the real part or the magnitude of the fourier transform it's even symmetric , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,21,0,0,233.740,18,19,signalprocessing,let's look at an example in the context of an example that we worked last time for the fourier transform , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,23,0,0,251.550,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier transform as we found was of the algebraic form one over a plus j omega , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,24,0,0,260.089,3,4,signalprocessing,and incidentally the fourier transform integral only converged for a greater than zero , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,28,0,0,294.050,56,57,signalprocessing,so in fact although i stressed last time that the complex exponentials is required to build a time function require exponentials of both positive and negative frequencies for x of t real what we see is that because of these symmetry properties either for the real and imaginary or magnitude and angle we can specify the fourier transform for let's say only positive frequencies , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,29,0,0,324.630,10,11,signalprocessing,and the symmetry then implies or tells us what the fourier transform then would be for the negative frequencies , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,31,0,0,339.480,9,10,signalprocessing,demonstrates another important and often useful property of the fourier transform , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,33,0,0,354.350,7,8,signalprocessing,so we have again the exponential whose fourier transform is one over a plus j omega , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,38,0,0,401.300,2,3,signalprocessing,whereas its fourier transform or the magnitude of its fourier transform has the inverse property that as a gets smaller in fact this scales down in frequency , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,39,0,0,416.840,8,9,signalprocessing,well this is a general property of the fourier transform namely the fact that a linear scaling in time generates the inverse linear scaling in frequency , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,56,0,0,597.980,14,17,signalprocessing,and now when i play the tape back because of the inverse relationship between time and frequency scaling we're now scaling in time by stretching out we would expect the frequencies to be lowered by a factor of two , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,69,0,0,754.590,24,25,signalprocessing,you can look at the algebra more carefully at your leisure but essentially what this says is that if x of omega is the fourier transform of a time function x of t then in fact x of t is very much like the fourier transform of x of omega , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,70,0,0,780.180,4,5,signalprocessing,in fact it's the fourier transform of x of minus omega to account for this minus sign , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,72,0,0,790.550,24,25,signalprocessing,so the duality relationship which follows from these two equations in fact says that if x of t and x of omega are a fourier transform pair if x and x are a fourier transform pair then x in fact has a fourier transform which is proportional to x turned around , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,73,0,0,815.910,6,7,signalprocessing,this duality in the continuous time fourier transform is very important , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,75,0,0,824.110,12,13,signalprocessing,it by the way is not a duality that surfaced in the fourier series because as you recall the fourier series begins with a continuous time function and in the frequency domain generates a sequence which would just naturally have problems associated with it if we attempted to interpret a duality , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,76,0,0,848.580,21,22,signalprocessing,and we'll see also that in the discrete time case one of the important differences between continuous time and discrete time fourier transforms is the fact that in continuous time we have duality in the discrete time fourier transform we don't , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,78,0,0,872.400,7,8,signalprocessing,here are in fact two examples of fourier transform pairs taken from examples in the text , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,80,0,0,892.310,2,3,signalprocessing,and its fourier transform corresponds to a rectangular shape in the frequency domain , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,82,0,0,911.590,13,14,signalprocessing,and in example four point ten we begin with a rectangle and its fourier transform is of the form of a sine x over x function , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,87,0,0,970.830,14,15,signalprocessing,one thing this says of course is that essentially any time you've calculated the fourier transform of one time function then you've actually calculated the fourier transform of two time functions , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,89,0,0,992.370,17,18,signalprocessing,also somewhat related to duality is what is referred to as parseval's relation for the continuous time fourier transform , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,91,0,0,1007.880,18,19,signalprocessing,as a summary of it says that the energy in a time function and the energy in its fourier transform are proportional the proportionality factor being a factor of two pi , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,95,0,0,1045.770,4,5,signalprocessing,although we've incorporated the fourier series within a framework of the fourier transform parseval's relation needs to be modified slightly for fourier series because of the fact that a periodic signal has an infinite amount of energy in it and essentially that form of parseval's relationship for the periodic case would say infinity equals infinity which isn't too useful , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,97,0,0,1097.020,19,20,signalprocessing,in other words the energy in one period is proportional to the energy in the sequence that represents the fourier series coefficients , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,102,0,0,1144.600,14,15,signalprocessing,and the time shifting property says if i have a time function with a fourier transform x of omega if i shift that time function in time then that corresponds to multiplying the fourier transform by this factor , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,105,0,0,1201.110,31,32,signalprocessing,another property and in fact a pair of properties that we'll make reference to as we turn our attention toward the end of this lecture to solving differential equations using the fourier transform is what's referred to as the differentiation property and its companion which is the integration property , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,106,0,0,1226.600,12,13,signalprocessing,the differentiation property says again if we have a time function with fourier transform x of omega the fourier transform of the time derivative of that corresponds to multiplying the fourier transform by a linear function of frequency , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,109,0,0,1262.230,3,4,signalprocessing,if for the differentiation property you multiply by j omega then for integration you must divide by j omega , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,114,0,0,1295.300,47,48,signalprocessing,so the integration property which is the inverse of the differentiation property says that we divide the transform by j omega and then if in fact there was a constant added to x of t we have to account for that by inserting an impulse into the fourier transform , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,115,0,0,1318.220,42,43,signalprocessing,and the final property that i want to draw your attention to on this view graph is the linearity property which is very straightforward to demonstrate from the analysis and synthesis equations which simply says if x one of omega is the fourier transform x one of t and x two of omega is the fourier transform of x two of t then the fourier transform of a linear combination is a linear combination of the fourier transforms , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,116,0,0,1352.700,14,15,signalprocessing,let me emphasize also that these properties for the most part apply both to fourier series and fourier transforms because in fact what we've done is to incorporate the fourier series within the framework of the fourier transform , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,118,0,0,1379.350,23,24,signalprocessing,however before we do that i'd like to focus on two additional major properties and these are what i refer to as the convolution property and the modulation property , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,119,0,0,1393.780,4,5,signalprocessing,and in fact the convolution property as i'm about to introduce it forms the mathematical and conceptual basis for the whole notion of filtering which in fact will be a topic by itself in a set of lectures and in fact is a chapter by itself in the textbook , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,120,0,0,1416.700,7,8,signalprocessing,similarly what i'll refer to as the modulation property , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,122,0,0,1432.160,6,7,signalprocessing,let me just indicate what the convolution property is , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,123,0,0,1438.450,10,11,signalprocessing,and what the convolution property tells us is that the fourier transform of the convolution of two time functions is the product of their fourier transforms , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,124,0,0,1459.620,49,50,signalprocessing,so it says for example that if i have a linear time invariant system and i have an input x of t an impulse response h of t and the output of course being the convolution then in fact if i look at this in the frequency domain the fourier transform of the output is the fourier transform of the input times the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,125,0,0,1493.190,15,16,signalprocessing,you can demonstrate this property algebraically by essentially taking the convolution integral and applying the fourier transform and doing the appropriate interchanging of the order of integration et cetera , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,127,0,0,1516.560,10,11,signalprocessing,and the intuitive interpretation stems from the relationship between the fourier transform of the impulse response and what we've referred to as the frequency response , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,131,0,0,1557.510,16,17,signalprocessing,and in fact the expression for the frequency response is identical to the expression for the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,132,0,0,1567.710,8,9,signalprocessing,in other words the frequency response is the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,133,0,0,1575.750,9,10,signalprocessing,now in that context how can we interpret the convolution property , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,139,0,0,1648.610,4,5,signalprocessing,so in fact the convolution property simply is telling us that in terms of the decomposition of the signal in terms of complex exponentials as we push that signal through a linear time invariant system we're separately multiplying by the frequency response the amplitudes of the exponential components used to build the input , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,141,0,0,1688.630,25,26,signalprocessing,i understand that going through that involves a little bit of sorting out and i strongly encourage you to try to understand and interpret the convolution property in those conceptual terms rather than simply by applying the mathematics to the convolution integral and seeing the terms match up on both sides , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,142,0,0,1713.930,4,5,signalprocessing,as i indicated the convolution property forms the basis for what's referred to as filtering , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,143,0,0,1721.580,26,27,signalprocessing,and this is a topic that we'll be treating in a considerable amount of detail after we've also gone through a discussion of the discrete time fourier transform in the next several lectures , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,146,0,0,1760.030,1,2,signalprocessing,the convolution property told us that if we look at the individual frequency components they get multiplied by the frequency response and so what that says is that we can amplify or attenuate any of those components separately using a linear time invariant system , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,151,0,0,1819.650,10,11,signalprocessing,in terms of filtering we can think back to the differentiation property and in fact interpret differentiator as a filter , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,152,0,0,1829.680,8,9,signalprocessing,recall that the differentiation property said that the fourier transform of the differentiated signal is the fourier transform of the original signal multiplied by j omega , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,154,0,0,1852.490,4,5,signalprocessing,in other words the fourier transform of the output is j omega times the fourier transform of the input , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,178,0,0,2058.020,11,12,signalprocessing,when we talked about square waves and we saw how the fourier series built up a square wave we saw that it was the high frequencies that were required in order to build up the sharp edges , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,185,0,0,2135.540,29,30,signalprocessing,i'd now like to comment on another property which is also as i indicated a topic in its own right and which really is the dual property to the convolution property and in fact could be argued directly from duality , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,186,0,0,2153.360,8,9,signalprocessing,and that is what's referred to as the modulation property , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,187,0,0,2159.230,1,2,signalprocessing,the convolution property told us that if we convolve in the time domain we multiply in the frequency domain , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,189,0,0,2183.140,8,9,signalprocessing,and in fact that is exactly what the modulation property is , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,191,0,0,2197.880,2,3,signalprocessing,whereas the convolution property is just the dual of that namely convolving in the time domain corresponds to multiplication in the frequency domain , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,192,0,0,2209.040,1,2,signalprocessing,the convolution property is the basis as i indicated for filtering , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,193,0,0,2214.390,1,2,signalprocessing,the modulation property as i've summarized it here in fact is the entire basis for amplitude modulation systems as used almost universally in communications , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,194,0,0,2230.080,36,37,signalprocessing,and what the modulation property as we'll see when we explore it in more detail tells us is that if we have a signal with a certain spectrum and we multiply by a sinusoidal signal whose fourier transform is a set of impulses then in a frequency domain we convolve , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,197,0,0,2272.960,25,26,signalprocessing,we've seen a number of properties and i indicated sometime earlier when we talked about differential equations that in fact it's the properties of the fourier transform that provide us with a very useful and important mechanism for solving linear constant coefficient differential equations , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,203,0,0,2362.320,37,38,signalprocessing,and it's because of the fact that we're assuming that it's a linear time invariant system that we can describe it in the frequency domain through the convolution property and we can use the properties of the fourier transform , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,206,0,0,2392.330,6,7,signalprocessing,and now we can use the differentiation property , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,207,0,0,2397.080,2,3,signalprocessing,if we fourier transform this entire expression the differentiation property tells us that the fourier transform of the derivative of the output is the fourier transform of the output multiplied by j omega , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,208,0,0,2414.560,7,8,signalprocessing,and linearity will let us write the fourier transform of this as a times y of omega , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,210,0,0,2429.330,6,7,signalprocessing,and x of omega is the fourier transform of x of t , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,211,0,0,2434.600,6,7,signalprocessing,so what we've used is the differentiation property and we've used the linearity property , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,213,0,0,2452.980,1,2,signalprocessing,the fourier transform of the output in terms of x of omega , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,214,0,0,2457.420,1,2,signalprocessing,the fourier transform of the input and a simple algebraic step gets us to this expression , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,215,0,0,2465.430,2,3,signalprocessing,so the fourier transform of the output is one over j omega plus a times the fourier transform of the input , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,218,0,0,2487.540,5,6,signalprocessing,well we know that the fourier transform of the output is the fourier transform of the input times the fourier transform of the impulse response of the system namely the frequency response , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,219,0,0,2501.830,16,17,signalprocessing,so in fact if we think of h of t and h of omega as a fourier transform pair it's the convolution property that lets us equate this term with h of omega , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,220,0,0,2518.295,5,6,signalprocessing,so here we're using the convolution property , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,221,0,0,2526.170,5,6,signalprocessing,so we know what the fourier transform of the impulse response is namely one over j omega plus a , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,224,0,0,2548.690,8,9,signalprocessing,we can attempt to go through the inverse fourier transform expression , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,228,0,0,2571.000,25,26,signalprocessing,so what that says is remember that we worked an example and in fact i showed you the example earlier in the lecture that the fourier transform of e to the minus at times the step is one over j omega plus a , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,232,0,0,2606.940,7,8,signalprocessing,i've drawn graphically the magnitude of the fourier transform here , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,239,0,0,2687.620,13,14,signalprocessing,just to illustrate one additional step in both evaluating inverse transforms and using fourier transform properties to solve linear constant coefficient differential equations let's take the same example and rather than finding the impulse response let's find the response to another exponential input , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,246,0,0,2746.030,3,4,signalprocessing,and again we fourier transform the equation , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,247,0,0,2751.700,6,7,signalprocessing,and we can remember this particular fourier transform pair , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,250,0,0,2765.430,29,30,signalprocessing,and now if we want to determine what the output y of t is we can do that by solving for y of omega and then generating the inverse fourier transform , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,252,0,0,2785.460,5,6,signalprocessing,and this is not a fourier transform that we've worked out before , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,254,0,0,2796.190,5,6,signalprocessing,what we have is a fourier transform which is a product of two terms each of which we can recognize , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,256,0,0,2812.160,8,9,signalprocessing,because of the linearity property associated with the fourier transform the inverse transform is then the sum of the inverse transform of each of those terms , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,259,0,0,2835.440,17,18,signalprocessing,we now have the sum of two terms and if we now recognize by inspection the inverse fourier transform of this we see that it's simply minus e to the minus two t times the unit step , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,263,0,0,2901.110,15,16,signalprocessing,hopefully you're beginning to get some sense now of how powerful and also beautiful the fourier transform is ]

Concept = DE221
Keyword = [Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,184,0,0,1866.940,4,4,signalprocessing,in fact becomes the differential in the integral , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,138,0,0,1459.790,45,46,signalprocessing,so in fact a first order difference equation as we see has a frequency response depending on the value of a that either looks approximately like a lowpass filter for a positive or a highpass filter for a negative very much like the first order differential equation looked like a lowpass filter in the continuous time case , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,85,0,0,833.640,8,9,signalprocessing,and we have looked previously at the associated differential equation , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,91,0,0,891.480,5,6,signalprocessing,now we can write the differential equation for either of these systems and as we talked about last time in the last several lectures solve that equation using and exploiting the properties of the fourier transform , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,92,0,0,906.730,8,9,signalprocessing,and in fact if we look at the differential equation relating the capacitor output to the voltage source input we recognize that this is an example that in effect we've solved previously , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,93,0,0,921.740,13,14,signalprocessing,and so just working our way down applying the fourier transform to the differential equation and generating the system function by taking the ratio of the capacitor voltage or its fourier transform to the fourier transform of the source we then have the system function associated with the system for which the output is the capacitor voltage , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,169,0,0,1605.170,12,12,signalprocessing,they in fact represent systems that are describable by linear constant coefficient differential equations , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,348,0,0,3238.670,24,24,signalprocessing,and out of these properties both are some mechanisms for using the laplace transform for such systems as those described by linear constant coefficient differential equations , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,48,0,0,506.620,19,19,signalprocessing,but these properties in particular provide the mechanism as they did with fourier transforms for turning linear constant coefficient differential equations into algebraic equations and corresponding lead to a mechanism for dealing with and solving linear constant coefficient differential equations , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,49,0,0,528.890,15,15,signalprocessing,and i'd like to illustrate that by looking at both first order and second order differential equations , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,50,0,0,536.010,9,10,signalprocessing,let's begin first of all with a first order differential equation , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,52,0,0,546.500,14,15,signalprocessing,what i mean by that is a system that's characterized by a first order differential equation , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,66,0,0,686.970,16,17,signalprocessing,so we have to decide which region of convergence that we pick and it's not the differential equation that will tell us that it's something else that has to give us that information , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,72,0,0,740.600,16,17,signalprocessing,so a very important point is that what we see is that the linear constant coefficient differential equation gives us the algebraic expression for the system function but does not tell us about the region of convergence , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,78,0,0,789.340,1,2,signalprocessing,the differential equation by itself does not completely specify the system it only essentially tells us what the algebraic expression is for the system function , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,80,0,0,801.950,10,11,signalprocessing,let's now look at a second order system and the differential equation that i picked in this case , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,82,0,0,814.150,6,7,signalprocessing,in particular it's a second order differential equation and i chosen just for simplicity to not include any derivatives on the right hand side although we could have , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,85,0,0,840.840,4,5,signalprocessing,that would convert this differential equation to an algebraic equation , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,119,0,0,1401.960,26,27,signalprocessing,now if we want to map continuous time filters to discrete time filters then in continuous time we're talking about a system function and an associated differential equation , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,135,0,0,1610.280,20,21,signalprocessing,the first one that i want to talk about is the more or less intuitive simple procedure of mapping a differential equation to a difference equation by simply replacing derivatives by differences , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,139,0,0,1644.870,4,5,signalprocessing,if we take the differential equation and do this with all the derivatives both in terms of y of t and x of t what we'll end up with is a difference equation , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,143,0,0,1684.740,17,18,signalprocessing,so in effect what it says is that every place in the system function or in the differential equation that we would be multiplying by s when laplace transformed , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,125.310,26,27,signalprocessing,and for example if n were equal to one then this would simply correspond to the magnitude squared of the frequency response for a first order differential equation , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,130,0,0,1573.570,31,32,signalprocessing,and let me just say quickly and in passing that although we won't go through this the notion that the bilinear transformation can be tied to the concept of taking the differential equation for the continuous time filter converting it to an integral equation by integrating enough times on both sides and then converting that to a difference equation by approximating the integrals with the trapezoidal rule , Lecture26FeedbackExampleTheInvertedPendulumMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,59,1,0,522.419,5,6,signalprocessing,so this is then the differential equation associated with the open loop system the basic dynamics of the system , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,256,0,0,2390.640,27,27,signalprocessing,and as we'll talk about in more detail in our next lecture where we'll get involved in a fairly detailed discussion of linear constant coefficient difference and differential equations this falls into that category , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,259,0,0,2436.550,7,8,signalprocessing,and likewise for a linear constant coefficient differential equation the specific one that i've indicated here under the assumption of initial rest the impulse response is e two t times u t , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,261,0,0,2466.410,21,21,signalprocessing,ok well as i've indicated in the next lecture we'll return to a much more detailed discussion of linear constant coefficient differential and difference equations , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,354,0,0,3265.750,36,36,signalprocessing,in the next lecture we'll turn our attention to a very important subclass of those systems namely systems that are describable by linear constant coefficient difference equations in the discrete time case and linear constant coefficient differential equations in the continuous time case , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,4,0,0,61.880,21,21,signalprocessing,a particularly important set of systems which are linear and time invariant are those that are represented by linear constant coefficient differential equations in continuous time or linear constant coefficient difference equations in discrete time , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,5,0,0,77.630,24,24,signalprocessing,for example electrical circuits that are built let's say out of resistors inductors and capacitors perhaps with op amps correspond to systems described by differential equations , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,6,0,0,89.150,10,10,signalprocessing,mechanical systems with springs and dashpots likewise are described by differential equations , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,8,0,0,110.110,11,11,signalprocessing,now presumably in a previous course you've had some exposure to differential equations for continuous time and their solution using notions like particular solution and homogeneous solution initial conditions et cetera , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,9,0,0,129.380,32,32,signalprocessing,later on in the course when we've developed the concept of the fourier transform after that the laplace transform we'll see some very efficient and useful ways of generating solutions both for differential and difference equations , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,10,0,0,145.010,12,12,signalprocessing,at this point however i'd like to just introduce linear constant coefficient differential equations and their discrete time counterpart , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,12,0,0,163.650,15,16,signalprocessing,well let's first consider what i refer to as an nth order linear constant coefficient differential equation as i've indicated here , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,21,0,0,247.290,17,18,signalprocessing,the n referring to the number of delays of the output involved just as an nth order differential equation the n or the order of the equation refers to the number of derivatives of the output , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,22,0,0,261.050,8,8,signalprocessing,now let's first begin with linear constant coefficient differential equations , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,23,0,0,267.170,9,9,signalprocessing,and the basic point of the solution for the differential equations is the fact that if we've generated some solution which i refer to here as y p t some solution to the equation for a given input then in fact we can add to that solution any other solution which satisfies what's referred to as the homogeneous equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,24,0,0,299.910,4,5,signalprocessing,so in fact this differential equation by itself is not a unique specification of the system , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,27,0,0,324.630,5,6,signalprocessing,by simply substituting into the differential equation the sum of a particular and the homogeneous solution and what you'll see is that the homogeneous contribution in fact goes to zero by definition of what we mean by the homogeneous equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,28,0,0,344.670,9,10,signalprocessing,now the homogeneous solution for a linear constant coefficient differential equation is of the form that i indicate at the bottom , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,38,0,0,454.980,17,18,signalprocessing,so what this says is that in order to obtain the solution for a linear constant coefficient differential equation we need some kind of auxiliary information that tells us is how to obtain these n undetermined constants , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,40,0,0,477.930,6,7,signalprocessing,for example in addition to the differential equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,42,0,0,495.300,3,4,signalprocessing,and so the differential equation together with the auxiliary information the initial conditions then lets you determine the total solution which namely lets you determine these previously unspecified coefficients in the homogeneous solution , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,54,0,0,640.500,16,17,signalprocessing,ok well let's look at an example and let's take the example of a first order differential equation as i've indicated here , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,55,0,0,654.470,6,7,signalprocessing,so we have a first order differential equation dy t dt ay t is the input x t , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,69,0,0,768.540,10,11,signalprocessing,and you can verify that simply by substituting into the differential equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,80,0,0,883.960,26,27,signalprocessing,in essence we can consider two linear time invariant systems in cascade one a differentiator the other the system that we're talking about described by the differential equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,93,0,0,1019.290,19,20,signalprocessing,okay so what we've seen then is the impulse response for a system described by a linear constant coefficient differential equation where in addition we would impose causality linearity and time invariance essentially through the initial conditions of initial rest , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,94,0,0,1039.619,17,17,signalprocessing,now pretty much the same kinds of things happen with difference equations as we've gone through with differential equations , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,103,0,0,1128.300,2,2,signalprocessing,as with differential equations we can guess or impose solutions of the form a times an exponential , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,114,0,0,1241.210,7,7,signalprocessing,now this was the same as with differential equations , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,115,0,0,1244.200,4,4,signalprocessing,in the case of differential equations we talked about specifying the value of the output and its derivatives , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,120,0,0,1302.680,10,10,signalprocessing,so we've seen a very direct parallel so far between differential equations and difference equations , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,121,0,0,1312.210,26,27,signalprocessing,in fact one difference between them that in some sense makes difference equations easier to deal with in some situations is that in contrast to a differential equation a difference equation if we assume causality in fact is an explicit input output relationship for the system , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,163,0,0,1713.780,5,5,signalprocessing,again as we did with differential equations the factor a cancels out , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,171,0,0,1788.970,4,4,signalprocessing,now we've seen the differential equations and difference equations in terms of the fact that there are families of solutions and in order to get causality linearity and time invariance requires imposing a particular set of initial conditions namely imposing initial rest on the system , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,172,0,0,1812.480,11,12,signalprocessing,let's now look at the difference equation and then later the differential equation interpreted in block diagram terms , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,222,0,0,2315.280,10,10,signalprocessing,now an essentially similar procedure can also be used for differential equations in terms of implementation using block diagrams or the interpretation of implementations using block diagrams , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,225,0,0,2340.870,7,8,signalprocessing,so let's consider a linear constant coefficient differential equation as i've indicated here and i have terms on the left side and terms on the right side , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,226,0,0,2353.930,3,4,signalprocessing,and with the differential equation let's consider taking all the terms over to the right side of the equation except for the highest derivative in the output , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,237,0,0,2465.180,12,13,signalprocessing,so just as we did with the difference equation we've converted the differential equation to an integral equation and we have a block diagram form very similar to what we had in the case of the difference equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,251,0,0,2583.630,10,11,signalprocessing,now let's just again with the integral equation or the differential equation look at this somewhat more generally , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,252,0,0,2593.270,5,6,signalprocessing,again if we take the differential equation the general differential equation integrate it a sufficient number of times to convert it to an integral equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,265,0,0,2687.550,9,9,signalprocessing,i indicated at the beginning that linear constant coefficient differential equations and difference equations will play an important role as linear time invariant systems throughout this course and throughout this set of lectures , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,266,0,0,2704.160,6,6,signalprocessing,i also stressed the fact that differential or difference equations by themselves are not a complete specification of the system because of the fact that we can add to any solution a homogeneous solution , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,271,0,0,2763.640,14,14,signalprocessing,now as i also indicated there are a variety of efficient procedures for solving differential and difference equations that we haven't yet addressed , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,273,0,0,2790.070,33,33,signalprocessing,and what we'll see is that with the fourier transform and later with the laplace and z transform we'll have a number of efficient and very useful ways of generating the solution for differential and difference equations under the assumption that the system is causal linear and time invariant , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,45,0,0,516.140,43,43,signalprocessing,and without dwelling on the details and with my suggesting that you give this a fair amount of reflection in fact what happens as the period goes to infinity is that this summation approaches an integral over omega where omega zero becomes the differential in omega and the periodic signal of course approach is the aperiodic signal , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,127.970,30,30,signalprocessing,so essentially in the decomposition of x of t as a linear combination of complex exponentials the complex amplitudes of those are in effect the fourier transform scaled by the differential and scaled by one over two pi , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,105,0,0,1201.110,27,27,signalprocessing,another property and in fact a pair of properties that we'll make reference to as we turn our attention toward the end of this lecture to solving differential equations using the fourier transform is what's referred to as the differentiation property and its companion which is the integration property , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,117,0,0,1371.900,18,18,signalprocessing,we'll be using a number of these properties shortly when we turn our attention to linear constant coefficient differential equations , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,197,0,0,2272.960,15,15,signalprocessing,we've seen a number of properties and i indicated sometime earlier when we talked about differential equations that in fact it's the properties of the fourier transform that provide us with a very useful and important mechanism for solving linear constant coefficient differential equations , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,202,0,0,2341.400,14,15,signalprocessing,and we're also going to assume then it's characterized by a linear constant coefficient differential equation where we're going to impose the condition that it's causal linear and time invariant or equivalently that the initial conditions are consistent with the initial rest , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,204,0,0,2378.940,9,10,signalprocessing,so let's take as our example a first order differential equation as i indicate here , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,236,0,0,2636.240,30,31,signalprocessing,and given just the little bit of discussion that we had previously about filtering you should be able to infer something about the filtering characteristics of this simple first order differential equation , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,238,0,0,2668.160,43,44,signalprocessing,so in fact you could think of the defocusing that we did on the image of fourier you could think of that approximately as similar to the kind of filtering action that you would get by passing a signal through a first order differential equation , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,239,0,0,2687.620,21,21,signalprocessing,just to illustrate one additional step in both evaluating inverse transforms and using fourier transform properties to solve linear constant coefficient differential equations let's take the same example and rather than finding the impulse response let's find the response to another exponential input , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,242,0,0,2721.930,10,11,signalprocessing,but let's do it instead by going back to the differential equation , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,243,0,0,2727.890,6,7,signalprocessing,and so here i'm taking a differential equation , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,264,0,0,2909.190,23,23,signalprocessing,we've seen already a glimpse of how it plays a role in filtering modulation how its properties help us with linear constant coefficient differential equations et cetera ]

Concept = DE222
Keyword = [Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,296,0,0,2986.850,24,25,signalprocessing,for example how the properties as they were in continuous time can be used to efficiently generate the solution and analyze linear constant coefficient difference equations , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,39,0,0,396.170,45,46,signalprocessing,in addition to these properties of the fourier transform there are a number of other properties that are particularly useful in the manipulation of the fourier transform and in fact in using the fourier transform to for example analyze systems represented by linear constant coefficient difference equations , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,103,0,0,1111.760,39,40,signalprocessing,more broadly the convolution property in combination with a number of the other properties that i introduced in particular the time shifting and linearity property allows us to generate or analyze systems that are described by linear constant coefficient difference equations , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,105,0,0,1140.650,17,18,signalprocessing,in particular let's think of a discrete time system that is described by a linear constant coefficient difference equation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,107,0,0,1159.340,12,13,signalprocessing,and recall that in fact in our discussion of linear constant coefficient difference equations it is the condition of initial rest that on the equation that guarantees for us that the system will be causal linear and time invariant , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,108,0,0,1178.720,7,8,signalprocessing,ok now let's consider a first order difference equation a system described by a first order difference equation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,132,0,0,1396.380,16,17,signalprocessing,here we have the impulse response for that associated with the system described by that particular difference equation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,138,0,0,1459.790,6,7,signalprocessing,so in fact a first order difference equation as we see has a frequency response depending on the value of a that either looks approximately like a lowpass filter for a positive or a highpass filter for a negative very much like the first order differential equation looked like a lowpass filter in the continuous time case , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,139,0,0,1483.710,21,22,signalprocessing,and in fact what i'd like to illustrate is the filtering characteristics or an example of filtering using a first order difference equation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,141,0,0,1512.030,13,14,signalprocessing,and we'll process the dow jones industrial average first through a first order difference equation where if we begin with a equals zero then referring to the frequency response that we have here a equals zero would simply be passing all frequencies , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,144,0,0,1548.270,27,28,signalprocessing,so let's watch the filtering first with a positive and we'll see it behave as a lowpass filter and then with a negative and we'll see the difference equation behaving as a highpass filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,148,0,0,1589.030,12,13,signalprocessing,and what we now want to do is process this through a difference equation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,149,0,0,1596.720,12,13,signalprocessing,above the dow jones average we show the impulse response of the difference equation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,169,0,0,1799.650,10,11,signalprocessing,ok so we see that in fact a first order difference equation is a filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,188,0,0,1659.130,19,20,signalprocessing,and as i've meant in previous lectures there are basically two classes of discrete time filters or discrete time difference equations , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,195,0,0,1714.020,4,5,signalprocessing,so in fact the difference equation let's say for three point moving average would be the difference equation that i indicate here just simply taking a data point and the two data points adjacent to it and forming an average of those three , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,243,0,0,2149.530,7,8,signalprocessing,recursive filters are filters for which the difference equation has feedback from the output back into the input , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,245,0,0,2166.910,9,10,signalprocessing,so for example as i've stressed previously a recursive difference equation has the general form that i indicate here a linear combination of weighted outputs on the left hand side and linear combination of weighted inputs on the right hand side , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,247,0,0,2198.610,21,22,signalprocessing,for example just to interpret this focus on the interpretation of this as a filter let's look at a first order difference equation which we've talked about and generated the solution to previously , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,248,0,0,2212.770,4,5,signalprocessing,so the first order difference equation would be as i indicated here , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,253,0,0,2257.540,6,7,signalprocessing,and so interpreting the first order difference equation as a system what we're attempting to generate is the frequency response which is the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,254,0,0,2272.760,3,4,signalprocessing,and from the difference equation we can of course solve for either one of those by using the properties exploiting the properties of fourier transform , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,255,0,0,2283.770,6,7,signalprocessing,applying the fourier transform to the difference equation we will end up with the fourier transform of the output equal to the fourier transform of the input times this factor which we know from the convolution property in fact is the frequency response of the system , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,258,0,0,2317.910,14,15,signalprocessing,so we have the frequency response obtained by applying the fourier transform to the difference equation the impulse response , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,142,0,0,1448.930,32,33,signalprocessing,as we did with the laplace transform we'll be talking very often about transforms which are rational and rational transforms as we'll see represent systems which are characterized by linear constant coefficient difference equations , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,176,0,0,1783.260,9,10,signalprocessing,is the z transform associated with a second order difference equation , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,304,0,0,3070.630,22,23,signalprocessing,and those properties allow us to develop and exploit the z transform in the context of systems describable by linear constant coefficient difference equations , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,305,0,0,3084.250,36,37,signalprocessing,so in the next lecture we'll focus on some properties of the z transform and then we'll see how to use those properties to help us in getting further insight and working with systems describable by difference equations , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,14,0,0,186.780,27,28,signalprocessing,as one part of this lecture what we'll want to do is exploit some of these properties in the context of systems described by linear constant coefficient difference equations , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,26,0,0,363.130,26,27,signalprocessing,now the convolution property and these other properties as i indicated we will find useful in talking about systems which are described by linear constant coefficient difference equations and in fact we'll do that shortly , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,53,0,0,676.540,33,34,signalprocessing,now what i'd like to do is look at the properties of the z transform and in particular exploit these properties in the context of systems that are described by linear constant coefficient difference equations , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,56,0,0,715.380,11,12,signalprocessing,so let's do that by first looking at a first order difference equation , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,57,0,0,722.480,7,8,signalprocessing,in the case of a first order difference equation which i've written as i indicate here , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,60,0,0,754.180,43,44,signalprocessing,so using those properties and together with the shifting property the property that tells us that the z transform of y of n minus one is z to the minus one times the z transform of y of n we then convert the difference equation to an algebraic expression , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,66,0,0,842.670,19,20,signalprocessing,well we have the same issue here as we had with the laplace transform namely the point that the difference equation tells us in essence what the algebraic expression is for the system function but doesn't specify the region of convergence , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,68,0,0,880.130,12,13,signalprocessing,if i let's say imposed on this system in addition to the difference equation the condition of causality then what that requires is that the impulse response be right sided or the region of convergence be outside the outermost pole , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,120,0,0,1417.840,12,13,signalprocessing,in discrete time there is the corresponding system function and the corresponding difference equation , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,135,0,0,1610.280,24,25,signalprocessing,the first one that i want to talk about is the more or less intuitive simple procedure of mapping a differential equation to a difference equation by simply replacing derivatives by differences , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,139,0,0,1644.870,31,32,signalprocessing,if we take the differential equation and do this with all the derivatives both in terms of y of t and x of t what we'll end up with is a difference equation , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,144,0,0,1696.460,2,3,signalprocessing,in the difference equation we would be multiplying by this factor , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,130,0,0,1573.570,57,58,signalprocessing,and let me just say quickly and in passing that although we won't go through this the notion that the bilinear transformation can be tied to the concept of taking the differential equation for the continuous time filter converting it to an integral equation by integrating enough times on both sides and then converting that to a difference equation by approximating the integrals with the trapezoidal rule , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,225,0,0,2150.410,39,40,signalprocessing,but while we're on the accumulator i just want to draw your attention to the fact which will kind of come up in a variety of ways again later that we can rewrite the equation for an accumulator the difference equation by recognizing that we could in fact write the output as the accumulated values up to time n one and then add on the last value , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,227,0,0,2183.510,6,7,signalprocessing,and so we could rewrite this difference equation as y n y n one x n , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,229,0,0,2196.800,13,14,signalprocessing,expressed that way what that corresponds to is what is called a recursive difference equation , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,240,0,0,2264.630,4,5,signalprocessing,so we have a difference equation that describes for us how the impulse is related to the step , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,242,0,0,2281.420,21,22,signalprocessing,and so if we think of x two n as the input and y two n as the output then the difference equation for the inverse system is what i've indicated here , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,255,0,0,2380.200,12,13,signalprocessing,and let me just quickly point to one example which is a difference equation as i've indicated here , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,261,0,0,2466.410,23,24,signalprocessing,ok well as i've indicated in the next lecture we'll return to a much more detailed discussion of linear constant coefficient differential and difference equations , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,354,0,0,3265.750,25,26,signalprocessing,in the next lecture we'll turn our attention to a very important subclass of those systems namely systems that are describable by linear constant coefficient difference equations in the discrete time case and linear constant coefficient differential equations in the continuous time case , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,4,0,0,61.880,30,31,signalprocessing,a particularly important set of systems which are linear and time invariant are those that are represented by linear constant coefficient differential equations in continuous time or linear constant coefficient difference equations in discrete time , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,7,0,0,95.010,26,27,signalprocessing,and in the discrete time case things such as moving average filters digital filters and most simple kinds of data smoothing are all linear constant coefficient difference equations , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,9,0,0,129.380,34,35,signalprocessing,later on in the course when we've developed the concept of the fourier transform after that the laplace transform we'll see some very efficient and useful ways of generating solutions both for differential and difference equations , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,18,0,0,222.410,13,14,signalprocessing,in the discrete time case the corresponding equation is a linear constant coefficient difference equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,20,0,0,242.630,8,9,signalprocessing,this equation is referred to an nth order difference equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,94,0,0,1039.619,10,11,signalprocessing,now pretty much the same kinds of things happen with difference equations as we've gone through with differential equations , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,95,0,0,1049.740,17,18,signalprocessing,in particular again let me remind you of the form of an nth order linear constant coefficient difference equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,98,0,0,1071.520,2,3,signalprocessing,once again difference equation is not a complete specification of the system because we can add to the response any homogeneous solution , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,99,0,0,1083.820,20,21,signalprocessing,in other words any solution that satisfies the homogeneous equation and the sum of those will also satisfy the original difference equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,100,0,0,1093.910,10,11,signalprocessing,so if we have a particular response that satisfies the difference equation then adding to that any response that is a solution to the homogeneous equation will also be a solution to the total equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,110,0,0,1201.990,10,11,signalprocessing,so the general form then for the solution to the difference equation is a sum of exponentials plus any particular solution , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,120,0,0,1302.680,13,14,signalprocessing,so we've seen a very direct parallel so far between differential equations and difference equations , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,121,0,0,1312.210,3,4,signalprocessing,in fact one difference between them that in some sense makes difference equations easier to deal with in some situations is that in contrast to a differential equation a difference equation if we assume causality in fact is an explicit input output relationship for the system , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,123,0,0,1338.670,5,6,signalprocessing,let's consider the nth order difference equation as i've indicated here , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,132,0,0,1423.390,13,14,signalprocessing,well let's look at this specifically in the context of a first order difference equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,133,0,0,1430.160,6,7,signalprocessing,so let's take a first order difference equation as i've indicated here , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,136,0,0,1456.780,6,7,signalprocessing,we can rewrite the first order difference equation by taking the term involving y n one over two the right hand side of the equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,158,0,0,1645.750,17,18,signalprocessing,and now of course if we want to generate the more general set of solutions to this difference equation we can do that by adding all of the homogeneous solutions namely all the solutions that satisfy the homogeneous equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,171,0,0,1788.970,7,8,signalprocessing,now we've seen the differential equations and difference equations in terms of the fact that there are families of solutions and in order to get causality linearity and time invariance requires imposing a particular set of initial conditions namely imposing initial rest on the system , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,172,0,0,1812.480,5,6,signalprocessing,let's now look at the difference equation and then later the differential equation interpreted in block diagram terms , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,173,0,0,1823.190,2,3,signalprocessing,now the difference equation as i just simply repeated here is y n x n ay n one where i've taken the delayed term over to the right hand side of the equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,184,0,0,1957.580,5,6,signalprocessing,well we know that the difference equation requires initial conditions , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,186,0,0,1975.300,10,11,signalprocessing,ok now let's look at this for the case of difference equations more generally , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,193,0,0,2062.960,2,3,signalprocessing,now the difference equation says that we want to take these and multiply them by the appropriate coefficients the coefficients in the difference equation and so we can do that as i've indicated here , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,200,0,0,2116.690,14,15,signalprocessing,which is a general block diagram for implementing or representing a linear constant coefficient difference equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,203,0,0,2141.680,12,13,signalprocessing,that it's only one of many possible algorithms or implementations for this difference equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,221,0,0,2290.180,17,18,signalprocessing,and one advantage simply stated is that when you think in terms of an implementation of a difference equation a delay corresponds to a storage register a memory location and by simply using the fact that we can interchange the order in which linear time invariant systems are cascaded we can reduce the amount of memory by a factor of two , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,237,0,0,2465.180,7,8,signalprocessing,so just as we did with the difference equation we've converted the differential equation to an integral equation and we have a block diagram form very similar to what we had in the case of the difference equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,245,0,0,2532.090,11,12,signalprocessing,and what you can see just as we saw with the difference equation is that now the integrators both integrators are integrating the same thing , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,250,0,0,2578.060,13,14,signalprocessing,very much similar to what we talked about in the case of the difference equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,260,0,0,2658.330,18,19,signalprocessing,so we've seen that the situation is very similar here as it was in the case of the difference equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,265,0,0,2687.550,12,13,signalprocessing,i indicated at the beginning that linear constant coefficient differential equations and difference equations will play an important role as linear time invariant systems throughout this course and throughout this set of lectures , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,266,0,0,2704.160,8,9,signalprocessing,i also stressed the fact that differential or difference equations by themselves are not a complete specification of the system because of the fact that we can add to any solution a homogeneous solution , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,271,0,0,2763.640,16,17,signalprocessing,now as i also indicated there are a variety of efficient procedures for solving differential and difference equations that we haven't yet addressed , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,273,0,0,2790.070,35,36,signalprocessing,and what we'll see is that with the fourier transform and later with the laplace and z transform we'll have a number of efficient and very useful ways of generating the solution for differential and difference equations under the assumption that the system is causal linear and time invariant ]

Keyword = [Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,53,0,0,577.010,12,17,signalprocessing,in discrete time we saw that the unit impulse function is the first difference of the unit step function ]

Concept = ES02
Keyword = [Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,15,0,0,169.500,22,23,signalprocessing,and then in beginning the discussion of the fourier representation of continuous time signals we chose as another set of basic inputs complex exponentials , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,16,0,0,181.880,13,14,signalprocessing,so for continuous time we chose a set of basic inputs which were complex exponentials , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,17,0,0,190.380,8,9,signalprocessing,the motivation there was the fact that the complex exponentials have what we refer to as the eigenfunction property , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,18,0,0,200.940,4,5,signalprocessing,namely if we put complex exponentials into our continuous time systems then the output is a complex exponential of the same form with only a change in complex amplitude , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,21,0,0,246.170,13,14,signalprocessing,and the notion of decomposing a signal as a linear combination of these complex exponentials is what first the fourier series representation and then later the fourier transform representation corresponded to , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,22,0,0,262.680,31,32,signalprocessing,and finally to remind you of one additional point the fact is that because of the eigenfunction property the response once we have decomposed the input as a linear combination of complex exponentials the response to that linear combination is straightforward to compute once we know the frequency response because of the eigenfunction property , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,27,0,0,322.160,28,29,signalprocessing,well let's begin with the eigenfunction property and let me just state that just as in continuous time if we consider a set of basic signals which are complex exponential rules then discrete time linear time m invariant systems have the eigenfunction property , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,28,0,0,345.390,5,6,signalprocessing,namely if we put a complex exponential into the system , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,29,0,0,350.200,4,5,signalprocessing,the response is a complex exponential at the same complex frequency and simply multiplied by an appropriate complex factor or constant , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,30,0,0,363.620,14,15,signalprocessing,and just as we did in continuous time we will be referring to this complex constant which is a function of course the frequency of the complex exponential input , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,35,0,0,418.330,20,21,signalprocessing,now just as we did in continuous time let's begin the discussion by first concentrating on periodic the representation through complex exponentials of periodic sequences and then we'll generalize that discussion to the representation of aperiodic signals , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,38,0,0,459.610,26,27,signalprocessing,now we can consider exponentials which have this as a fundamental frequency or which are harmonics of that and that would correspond to the class of complex exponentials of the form e to the jk omega zero n , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,39,0,0,479.290,2,3,signalprocessing,so these complex exponentials then as k varies are complex exponentials that are harmonically related all of which are periodic with the same period capital n , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,43,0,0,516.780,14,15,signalprocessing,and so we consider a periodic signal which is a weighted sum of these complex exponentials , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,48,0,0,553.860,23,24,signalprocessing,however before we do that let me focus on an important distinction between continuous time and discrete time in the context of these complex exponentials and this representation , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,49,0,0,570.420,4,5,signalprocessing,when we talked about complex exponentials and sinusoids early in the course one of the differences that we saw between continuous time and discrete time is that in continuous time as we vary the frequency variable we see different complex exponentials as omega varies , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,51,0,0,597.750,16,17,signalprocessing,or said another way it's straightforward to verify that if we think of this class of complex exponentials , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,52,0,0,608.880,23,24,signalprocessing,that in fact if we consider varying k by adding to it capital n where capital n is the period of the fundamental complex exponential , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,53,0,0,625.690,17,18,signalprocessing,then in fact if we replace k by k plus capital n we'll see exactly the same complex exponentials over again , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,55,0,0,639.690,11,12,signalprocessing,what it says is that if i consider this class of complex exponentials as k varies from zero through capital n minus one we will see all of the ones that there are to see , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,58,0,0,676.230,8,9,signalprocessing,because beyond that we'll simply see the same complex exponentials over again , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,59,0,0,682.870,17,18,signalprocessing,so for example if k takes on the value capital n that will be exactly the same complex exponential as if k is equal to zero , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,60,0,0,694.300,13,14,signalprocessing,so in fact this sum ranges only over capital n of the distinct complex exponentials , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,62,0,0,707.100,5,6,signalprocessing,although in fact since these complex exponentials repeat in k i could actually consider instead of from zero to n minus one i could consider from one to n or from two to n plus one or whatever , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,63,0,0,723.800,31,32,signalprocessing,or said another way in this representation i could alternatively choose k outside this range thinking of these coefficients simply as periodically repeating in k because of the fact that these complex exponentials periodically repeat in k , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,88,0,0,961.960,17,18,signalprocessing,and the difference arises to a large extent because of this notion that in discrete time the complex exponentials are periodic in their frequency , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,91,0,0,992.250,4,5,signalprocessing,and of course the complex exponentials involved are periodic , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,112,0,0,1214.430,14,15,signalprocessing,now for this particular example we can expand this out directly in terms of complex exponentials and essentially recognize this as a sum of complex exponentials , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,150,0,0,1566.140,37,38,signalprocessing,and recall also that this was essentially the trick that we used in continuous time to allow us to develop or utilize the fourier series to provide a representation of aperiodic signals as a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,209,0,0,2043.820,19,20,signalprocessing,once again the reason for the periodicity it all stems back to the fact that when we talk about complex exponentials and recall back to the early lectures , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,210,0,0,2055.199,24,25,signalprocessing,in discrete time as the frequency variable covers a range of two pi when you proceed past that range you simply see the same complex exponentials over and over again , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,282,0,0,2843.884,28,29,signalprocessing,ok so to summarize what we've done is to pretty much parallel somewhat more quickly the kind of development that we went through for continuous time representation through complex exponentials paralleled that for the discrete time case , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,288,0,0,2915.120,11,12,signalprocessing,the other very important difference tied back to the difference between complex exponentials continuous time and discrete time , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,289,0,0,2923.050,3,4,signalprocessing,in continuous time complex exponentials as you vary the frequency generate distinct time functions , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,12,0,0,122.890,25,26,signalprocessing,and i draw your attention again to the basic point that the synthesis equation essentially corresponds to decomposing the sequence as a linear combination of complex exponentials with amplitudes that are in effect proportional to the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,18,0,0,208.580,20,21,signalprocessing,and i stress again that the underlying basis for this periodicity property is the fact that it's the set of complex exponentials that are inherently periodic in frequency , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,45,0,0,473.050,31,32,signalprocessing,there also is a dual to the time shifting property which is referred to as the frequency shifting property which tells us that if we multiply a time function by a complex exponential that in effect generates a frequency shift , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,61,0,0,665.120,35,36,signalprocessing,now we also saw and have talked about a relationship between the fourier transform the impulse response and what we call the frequency response in the context of the response of a system to a complex exponential , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,62,0,0,685.840,1,2,signalprocessing,specifically complex exponentials are eigenfunctions of linear time invariant systems , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,63,0,0,693.210,12,13,signalprocessing,one of these into the system gives us as an output a complex exponential with the same complex frequency multiplied by what we refer to as the eigenvalue , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,71,0,0,783.330,22,23,signalprocessing,specifically the argument was that the fourier transform of a sequence or signal corresponds to decomposing it into a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,72,0,0,798.330,5,6,signalprocessing,what's the amplitude of those complex exponentials , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,74,0,0,805.990,15,16,signalprocessing,if we think of pushing through the system that linear combination then each of those complex exponentials gets the amplitude modified or multiplied by the fourier transform of by the frequency response which we saw is the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,75,0,0,829.130,6,7,signalprocessing,so the amplitudes of the output complex exponentials is then the amplitudes of the input complex exponentials multiplied by the frequency response , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,77,0,0,859.580,41,42,signalprocessing,so it's important in thinking about the convolution property to think about it in terms of nothing more than the fact that we've decomposed the input and we're now modifying separately through multiplication through scaling the amplitudes of each of the complex exponential components , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,79,0,0,900.640,15,16,signalprocessing,kind of the idea that if we decompose the input as a linear combination of complex exponentials we can separately attenuate or amplify each of those components , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,90,0,0,1006.030,13,14,signalprocessing,although it's important to recognize that because of the inherent periodicity of the complex exponentials these frequencies are exactly the same frequencies as these frequencies , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,96,0,0,1054.800,3,4,signalprocessing,and once our complex exponentials go past pi then in fact we start seeing the lower frequencies again , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,259,0,0,2757.240,20,21,signalprocessing,in the continuous time fourier series we have a periodic time function expanded as a linear combination of harmonically related complex exponentials , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,265,0,0,2831.830,29,30,signalprocessing,and we now have a continuous time function which is no longer periodic this was for the aperiodic case represented as a linear combination of infinitesimally close in frequency complex exponentials with complex amplitudes given by x of omega d omega divided by two pi , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,270,0,0,2899.560,10,11,signalprocessing,corresponding to representing a periodic sequence through a set of complex exponentials where now we only required a finite number of these because of the fact that in fact there are only a finite number of harmonically related complex exponentials , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,271,0,0,2918.580,7,8,signalprocessing,that's an inherent property of discrete time complex exponentials , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,274,0,0,2933.270,21,22,signalprocessing,which of course are discrete as fourier series coefficients are and which periodically repeat because of the fact that the associated complex exponentials periodically repeat , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,278,0,0,3001.500,37,38,signalprocessing,and so the important difference between the continuous time and discrete time case kind of arose in part out of the fact that discrete time is discrete time continuous time is continuous time and the fact that complex exponentials are periodic in discrete time , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,156.370,16,17,signalprocessing,now recall also that in developing the fourier transform i interpreted the fourier transform as the complex amplitude of a decomposition of the signal in terms of a set of complex exponentials , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,12,0,0,172.120,21,22,signalprocessing,and the frequency response or the convolution property in effect tells us how to modify the amplitudes of each of those complex exponentials as they go through the system , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,13,0,0,185.320,24,25,signalprocessing,now this led to the notion of filtering where the basic concept was that since we can modify the amplitudes of each of the complex exponential components separately we can for example retain some of them and totally eliminate others , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,40,0,0,454.050,13,14,signalprocessing,in today's lecture what i'll focus on is first the case of a complex exponential carrier second the case of sinusoidal carrier , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,41,0,0,465.210,4,5,signalprocessing,and in fact the complex exponential carrier and sinusoidal carrier are obviously very closely related since the complex exponential carrier is in effect two sinusoidal carriers , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,43,0,0,484.900,12,13,signalprocessing,so let's first begin the discussion of amplitude modulation by considering a complex exponential carrier and then moving on to a discussion of a sinusoidal carrier , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,53,0,0,565.760,9,10,signalprocessing,and then the carrier signal since it's a single complex exponential has a fourier transform which is an impulse in the frequency domain , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,58,0,0,618.660,21,22,signalprocessing,so what this says is that if we have a signal x of t and we use it to modulate a complex exponential carrier in the frequency domain what we've simply done is to take the original spectrum and shift it in frequency , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,77,0,0,766.920,32,33,signalprocessing,now one question that you could conceivably be asking is if we're talking about practical systems and not simply mathematics does it make sense in the real world to consider using a complex exponential carrier , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,79,0,0,791.300,16,17,signalprocessing,that very often in practical systems one considers using a carrier which in fact is a complex exponential , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,80,0,0,800.640,2,3,signalprocessing,well a complex exponential is complex , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,109,0,0,999.660,15,16,signalprocessing,which is an application that in fact surfaces fairly often in the context of a complex exponential carrier , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,117,0,0,1067.860,6,7,signalprocessing,and we modulate it with a complex exponential carrier with a carrier frequency omega c , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,142,0,0,1320.600,9,10,signalprocessing,so we've worked our way through modulation with a complex exponential carrier , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,143,0,0,1328.350,9,10,signalprocessing,and what we saw among other things with a complex exponential carrier is that what it corresponds to is two branches , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,146,0,0,1354.340,3,4,signalprocessing,modulation of the complex exponential carrier really would be accomplished with modulation with a sinusoidal carrier and in particular with sinusoidal carriers that are in quadrature as it's referred to or equivalently ninety degrees out of phase , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,148,0,0,1380.750,19,20,signalprocessing,modulation using only a sinusoidal carrier very often is used in its own right not only for generating a complex exponential carrier but as a carrier by itself , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,152,0,0,1422.920,13,14,signalprocessing,and of course we can write that as the sum of two complex exponential signals , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,165,0,0,1529.500,6,7,signalprocessing,now in the case of a complex exponential that was easy to do , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,190,0,0,1703.140,15,16,signalprocessing,and just to summarize for the case of a sinusoidal carrier as opposed to a complex exponential carrier the modulator is just as it is in the complex exponential case , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,321,0,0,2904.470,5,6,signalprocessing,that's of course what the complex exponential carrier did , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,352,0,0,3185.000,20,21,signalprocessing,and as we'll see the next lecture very much the same kinds of notions apply for discrete time sinusoidal and complex exponential amplitude modulation , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,69.950,13,14,signalprocessing,we talked about the properties and analysis of modulation when we had a complex exponential carrier signal , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,111.920,9,10,signalprocessing,one is a parallel discussion particularly as associated with complex exponential and sinusoidal modulation for discrete time signals , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,20,0,0,238.860,7,8,signalprocessing,what we'll focus on is first a complex exponential carrier and second a sinusoidal carrier , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,23,0,0,270.280,4,5,signalprocessing,so let's first consider complex exponential and sinusoidal carriers for the discrete time case emphasizing the very strong parallel and similarity between discrete time and continuous time , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,27,0,0,309.480,10,11,signalprocessing,and since we want to consider first of all a complex exponential carrier we'll consider the case of c of n equal to e to the j omega sub cn , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,36,0,0,388.170,7,8,signalprocessing,so the result of modulation with a complex exponential is a straightforward shift of the spectrum so that what occurred around zero frequency now occurs around the frequency omega sub c , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,37,0,0,407.040,12,13,signalprocessing,now in the continuous time case we demodulated when we had a complex exponential carrier we demodulated by essentially just shifting the spectrum back , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,40,0,0,469.460,10,11,signalprocessing,so what's happened in the discrete time case with the complex exponential is exactly the same as in continuous time , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,47,0,0,517.460,14,15,signalprocessing,so in this case now rather than a carrier signal which is a single complex exponential it's now a sinusoidal carrier and the sinusoidal carrier is the sum of two complex exponential , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,48,0,0,532.320,39,40,signalprocessing,and so if we consider a modulated spectrum that is the spectrum of x of n something of the type that i indicate here and the spectrum of the carrier now since the carrier is sinusoidal rather than a complex exponential consists of two impulses one at plus omega sub c and one at minus omega sub c convolving this spectrum with this spectrum gives us a replication of x of omega around plus and minus omega sub c , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,66,0,0,843.490,22,23,signalprocessing,another very important reason and it's important to stress this at the outset is that whereas the theory involving the use of complex exponential and sinusoidal modulation parallels very strongly in the continuous time and the discrete time case , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,73,0,0,973.110,24,25,signalprocessing,ok now there is another application that we have discussed for both continuous time and actually previously for discrete time amplitude modulation with sinusoidal complex exponential carriers , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,77,0,0,1025.579,25,26,signalprocessing,and the notion was that if we modulate the signal with a carrier which is minus one to the n and that's just simply a complex exponential or sinusoidal carrier with a carrier frequency of pi then that in effect interchanges the low frequencies and the high frequencies , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,89,0,0,1259.130,22,23,signalprocessing,ok well so what we've done so far for continuous time and discrete time is to talk about modulation amplitude modulation with complex exponential and sinusoidal carriers , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,13,0,0,153.060,10,11,signalprocessing,the basic signals that we picked in the representation were complex exponentials , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,14,0,0,158.800,35,36,signalprocessing,and in what we had referred to as the synthesis equation the synthesis equation corresponded to in effect a decomposition as a linear combination a decomposition of x of t as a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,15,0,0,176.980,21,22,signalprocessing,and of course associated with this was the corresponding analysis equation that in effect gave us the amplitudes associated with the complex exponentials , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,16,0,0,188.850,5,6,signalprocessing,now why did we pick complex exponentials , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,17,0,0,191.550,7,8,signalprocessing,well recall that the reason was that complex exponentials are eigenfunctions of linear time invariant systems and that was very convenient , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,18,0,0,201.900,35,36,signalprocessing,specifically if we have a linear time invariant system with an impulse response h of t what we had shown is that that class of systems has the property that if we put in a complex exponential we get out a complex exponential at the same frequency and with a change in amplitude , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,20,0,0,240.380,7,8,signalprocessing,so the notion of decomposing signals into complex exponentials was very intimately connected and the fourier transform was very intimately connected with the eigenfunction property of complex exponentials for linear time invariant systems , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,21,0,0,260.070,1,2,signalprocessing,well complex exponentials of that type are not the only eigenfunctions for linear time invariant systems , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,24,0,0,285.670,6,7,signalprocessing,for any value of s the complex exponential is an eigenfunction , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,26,0,0,297.040,7,8,signalprocessing,in other words the response to this complex exponential is the convolution of the impulse response with the excitation , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,31,0,0,335.040,14,15,signalprocessing,so just simply carrying through the algebra what we would conclude is that a complex exponential with any complex number s would generate as an output a complex exponential of the same form multiplied by whatever this integral is , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,36,0,0,390.340,17,18,signalprocessing,so what we have then is the eigenfunction property more generally in terms of a more general complex exponential where the complex factor is given by this integral , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,45,0,0,504.140,6,7,signalprocessing,and rather than pushing just a complex exponential through the system we've pushed a more general time function e to the st where s is a complex number with both a real part and an imaginary part , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,84.380,24,25,signalprocessing,now just as in continuous time in discrete time the fourier transform corresponded to a representation of a sequence as a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,115.310,5,6,signalprocessing,the reason that we picked complex exponentials was because of the fact that they are eigenfunctions of linear time invariant systems , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,124.730,7,8,signalprocessing,in other words if you have a complex exponential into a linear time invariant system the output is a complex exponential , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,15,0,0,164.680,16,17,signalprocessing,and just as in continuous time there are a set of signals more general than the complex exponentials which are also eigenfunctions of linear time invariant systems , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,23,0,0,280.530,10,11,signalprocessing,so for a linear time invariant system a more general complex exponential sequence of this form generates as an output a complex exponential sequence of the same form with a change in amplitude which we're representing as h of z recognizing the fact that it's going to be a function of what that complex number is , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,28,0,0,335.790,9,10,signalprocessing,and what we've simply done is to expand from complex exponentials with a purely imaginary exponent complex exponential time functions or sequences of that form to ones that have more general complex exponential factors , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,183,0,0,2208.200,57,58,signalprocessing,if we expand this in a partial fraction expansion and we look at the impulse response associated with this we know how to take the inverse of laplace transform of this where i'm just naturally assuming causality throughout the discussion the continuous time impulse response then is the sum of exponentials with these amplitudes and at these complex exponential frequencies , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,187,0,0,1746.820,12,13,signalprocessing,these relate strongly to sinusoidal signals namely the class of real and complex exponentials , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,191,0,0,1783.900,4,5,signalprocessing,shortly we'll also consider complex exponentials where these numbers can then become complex , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,227,0,0,2066.659,21,22,signalprocessing,and that is one but not the only reason why in the discrete time case it's often most convenient to phrase real exponentials in the form alpha n rather than e beta n , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,229,0,0,2094.520,2,3,signalprocessing,those are real exponentials continuous time and discrete time , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,230,0,0,2097.960,7,8,signalprocessing,now let's look at the continuous time complex exponential , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,231,0,0,2103.130,6,7,signalprocessing,and what i mean by a complex exponential again is an exponential of the form c e a t , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,255,0,0,2299.350,7,8,signalprocessing,in particular we'll make reference to our complex exponentials in the discrete time case , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,256,0,0,2308.860,4,5,signalprocessing,the expression for the complex exponential looks very much like the expression for the real exponential except that now we have complex factors , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,277,0,0,2477.620,8,9,signalprocessing,now one can ask whether in general the complex exponential with the magnitude of alpha equal to one is periodic or not periodic , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,281,0,0,2519.570,10,11,signalprocessing,in a continuous time case when we have a pure complex exponential so that the terms aren't exponentially growing or decaying those exponentials are always periodic , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,287,0,0,2578.000,6,7,signalprocessing,in particular sinusoids and real and complex exponentials , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,290,0,0,2596.700,10,11,signalprocessing,and these differences will surface when we exploit sinusoids and complex exponentials as basic building blocks for more general continuous time and discrete time signals , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,3,0,0,59.745,11,12,signalprocessing,in the last lecture we discussed sinusoidal and real and complex exponential signals both for continuous time and discrete time , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,24,0,0,285.840,8,9,signalprocessing,the second is a decomposition of inputs into complex exponentials a linear combination of complex exponentials and that leads to a representation of signals and systems through what we'll refer to as fourier analysis , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,29,0,0,358.030,9,10,signalprocessing,and it typically consists of a sum of n complex exponentials , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,31,0,0,374.000,29,30,signalprocessing,and this form for the homogeneous solution in essence drops out of examining the homogeneous equation where if we assume that the form of the homogeneous solution is a complex exponential with some unspecified amplitude and unspecified exponent , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,37,0,0,438.160,8,9,signalprocessing,namely it consists of a sum of n complex exponentials where the coefficients the n coefficients attach to each of those complex exponential is undetermined or unspecified , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,59,0,0,687.180,9,10,signalprocessing,the homogeneous solution is an amplitude factor times a complex exponential , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,61,0,0,700.860,18,19,signalprocessing,what you can see is that in this equation i can cancel out the amplitude factor and this complex exponential , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,18,0,0,236.120,30,31,signalprocessing,and in particular the signals that we'll be using as the building blocks for our more general signals rather than impulses as we've dealt with before will be in general complex exponentials , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,19,0,0,252.230,26,27,signalprocessing,so in a general sense in the continuous time case we'll be thinking in terms of a decomposition of our signals as a linear combination of complex exponentials continuous time or in the discrete time case complex exponentials where z k is complex here in discrete time and s sub k is complex here in continuous time , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,23,0,0,309.290,4,5,signalprocessing,what we'll find with complex exponentials either continuous time or discrete time is that they very nicely have those two properties , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,24,0,0,317.870,29,30,signalprocessing,in particular the notion that the output of a linear time invariant system is easy to compute is tied to what's referred to as the eigenfunction function property of complex exponentials which we'll focus on shortly in a little more detail , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,27,0,0,357.860,17,18,signalprocessing,now in doing this although we could in fact begin with our attention focused on in general complex exponentials what we'll choose to do is first focus on the case in which the exponent in the continuous time case is purely imaginary as i indicate here and in the discrete time case where the magnitude of the complex number z k is equal to one , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,33,0,0,439.210,9,10,signalprocessing,so for now we want to restrict ourselves to complex exponentials of a particular form and in fact also initially to continuous time signals and systems , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,34,0,0,450.980,10,11,signalprocessing,so let's begin with the continuous time case and the complex exponentials that we want to deal with and focus first of all on what i refer to as the eigenfunction property of this particular set of building blocks , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,37,0,0,496.020,20,21,signalprocessing,now more or less the justification for this or the proof follows by simply looking at the response to a complex exponential using the convolution integral , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,38,0,0,508.140,5,6,signalprocessing,so if we put a complex exponentials into a linear time invariant system with impulse response h t then we can express the response as i've indicated here , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,39,0,0,522.780,6,7,signalprocessing,we can then recognize that this complex exponentials can be factored into two terms , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,40,0,0,528.680,6,7,signalprocessing,and so we can rewrite this complex exponential as this product , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,42,0,0,550.360,15,16,signalprocessing,and so what we're left with when we track this through is that with a complex exponential input we get an output which is the same complex exponential namely this factor times this integral , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,44,0,0,577.040,8,9,signalprocessing,and so in fact we put in a complex exponential we get out a complex exponentials of the same frequency multiplied by a complex constant , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,49,0,0,627.540,9,10,signalprocessing,ok now it's because of the eigenfunction property that complex exponentials are particularly convenient as building blocks , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,52,0,0,661.030,11,12,signalprocessing,and in fact that turns out to be the case with complex exponentials , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,56,0,0,689.770,11,12,signalprocessing,and the representation that's developed in terms of linear combinations of complex exponentials is what's referred to as the fourier transform , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,65,0,0,759.640,6,7,signalprocessing,now let's examine first of all complex exponentials and recognize first of all that there is a complex exponential that has exactly the same period and fundamental frequency as our more general periodic signal namely the complex exponential e j omega zero t where omega zero is two pi t zero or equivalently t zero is two pi omega zero , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,66,0,0,792.640,3,4,signalprocessing,now that's the complex exponential which has t zero as the fundamental period , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,67,0,0,799.760,5,6,signalprocessing,but there are harmonically related complex exponentials that also have t zero as a period although in fact their fundamental period is shorter , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,68,0,0,812.520,6,7,signalprocessing,so we can also look at complex exponentials of the form e j k omega zero t , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,72,0,0,838.520,11,12,signalprocessing,so as k an integer varies these correspond to harmonically related complex exponentials , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,73,0,0,849.140,57,58,signalprocessing,now what the fourier series says and we'll justify this bit by bit as the discussion goes on what the fourier series says and in fact what fourier said which was essentially his brilliant insight is that if i have a very general periodic signal i can represent it as a linear combination of these harmonically related complex exponentials , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,82,0,0,935.430,17,18,signalprocessing,this representation of the fourier series which i've repeated again here is what's referred to as the complex exponential form of the fourier series , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,85,0,0,976.700,2,3,signalprocessing,now that complex exponential form is one representation for the fourier series , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,89,0,0,1007.240,10,11,signalprocessing,essentially we can get to the trigonometric form from the complex exponential form by recognizing that if we express the complex coefficient in polar form or in rectangular form and expand the complex exponential term out in terms of cosine plus j sine using just simply euler's relation then we will end up with a representation for the periodic signal or a re expression of the fourier series expression that we had previously either in the form that i indicate here where now the periodic signal is expressed in terms of a summation of cosines with appropriate amplitude and phase , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,93,0,0,1096.590,6,7,signalprocessing,however let's look back and the complex exponential form for the fourier series at the top of the board , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,95,0,0,1118.700,12,13,signalprocessing,so the representation that we will most typically be using is the complex exponential form , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,102,0,0,1184.660,14,15,signalprocessing,but essentially the algebra develops out of the recognition that if we integrate a complex exponential over one period t zero and i mean by this notation that this is an integral over a period where i don't particularly care where the period starts and where the period stops in other words exactly what period i picked that this integral is equal to t zero when m is equal to zero , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,109,0,0,1282.310,62,63,signalprocessing,if we multiply both sides of that by e j n omega zero t and integrate that over a period both sides of the equation integrated over a period so these two equations are equal and then in essence interchange the summation and the integration so that this part of the expression comes outside the sum and then we combine these two complex exponentials together where we come out is the expression that i've indicated here , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,118,0,0,1414.260,24,25,signalprocessing,what i'll refer to as the fourier series synthesis equation is the equation that tells us how to build x t out of these complex exponentials , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,191,0,0,2043.480,20,21,signalprocessing,so here we have the expression which is the synthesis equation telling us how x t could be represented as complex exponentials if it can be , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,288,0,0,2957.560,15,16,signalprocessing,we more broadly want to have a more general representation of signals in terms of complex exponentials , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,292,0,0,2992.810,20,21,signalprocessing,the basic strategy with an aperiodic signal is to think of representing this aperiodic signal as a linear combination of complex exponentials by the simple trick of periodically replicating this signal generating a periodic signal using a fourier series representation for that periodic signal and then simply letting the period go to infinity , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,3,0,0,56.260,19,20,signalprocessing,last time we began to address the issue of building continuous time signals out of a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,79.110,24,25,signalprocessing,for periodic signals we had the continuous time fourier series where we built the periodic signal out of a linear combination of harmonically related complex exponentials , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,12,0,0,149.470,26,27,signalprocessing,now what we'd like to do is extend this idea to provide a mechanism for building non periodic signals also out of a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,25,0,0,284.220,24,25,signalprocessing,the fourier series synthesis expression for the periodic signal expresses x tilde of t the periodic signal as a linear combination of harmonically related complex exponentials with the fundamental frequency omega zero equaled to two pi divided by the period , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,49,0,0,589.930,29,30,signalprocessing,so we now have an analysis equation and a synthesis equation which in effect expresses for us how to build x of t in terms of infinitesimally finely spaced complex exponentials , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,105,0,0,1188.160,22,23,signalprocessing,and the reason you should recall and keep in mind is related to the fact that we're building our signals out of complex exponentials which require both positive values of omega and negative values of omega , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,3,0,0,55.600,20,21,signalprocessing,in the last two lectures we saw how periodic and non periodic signals could be represented as linear combinations of complex exponentials , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,0,0,105.350,23,24,signalprocessing,the synthesis equation being an equation the tells us how to build the time function out of in essence a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,0,0,117.060,13,14,signalprocessing,and the analysis equation telling us how to get the amplitudes of those complex exponentials from the associated time function , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,127.970,14,15,signalprocessing,so essentially in the decomposition of x of t as a linear combination of complex exponentials the complex amplitudes of those are in effect the fourier transform scaled by the differential and scaled by one over two pi , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,28,0,0,294.050,10,11,signalprocessing,so in fact although i stressed last time that the complex exponentials is required to build a time function require exponentials of both positive and negative frequencies for x of t real what we see is that because of these symmetry properties either for the real and imaginary or magnitude and angle we can specify the fourier transform for let's say only positive frequencies , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,128,0,0,1528.840,11,12,signalprocessing,recall that one of the things that led us to use complex exponentials as building blocks was the fact that they're eigenfunctions of linear time and variant systems , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,130,0,0,1545.640,8,9,signalprocessing,and i have an input which is a complex exponential the output is a complex exponential of the same frequency multiplied by what we call the frequency response , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,134,0,0,1582.260,39,40,signalprocessing,well remember what i said at the beginning of the lecture when i pointed to the synthesis equation and i said in essence the synthesis equation tells us how to decompose x of t as a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,135,0,0,1600.740,3,4,signalprocessing,what are the complex amplitudes of those complex exponentials , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,136,0,0,1605.020,7,8,signalprocessing,in terms of our notation here the complex amplitude of those complex exponentials is x of omega or proportional to x of omega in particular it's x of omega d omega and then a factor of two pi , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,138,0,0,1638.090,8,9,signalprocessing,what comes out is the amplitude of the complex exponentials that are used to build the output , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,139,0,0,1648.610,22,23,signalprocessing,so in fact the convolution property simply is telling us that in terms of the decomposition of the signal in terms of complex exponentials as we push that signal through a linear time invariant system we're separately multiplying by the frequency response the amplitudes of the exponential components used to build the input ]

Keyword = [Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,86,0,0,944.280,11,12,signalprocessing,and the analysis equation was an integration as opposed to the synthesis equation which is a summation , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,89,0,0,976.050,7,8,signalprocessing,so we have then to summarize the synthesis equation and the analysis equation for the discrete time fourier series , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,174,0,0,1791.760,6,7,signalprocessing,and this is the fourier series synthesis equation where the equation below tells us how we get these fourier coefficients or the envelope from x of n , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,193,0,0,1933.080,4,5,signalprocessing,and we have the synthesis equation which i show as the top equation on this transparency , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,194,0,0,1941.470,9,10,signalprocessing,and this is the integral that the fourier series synthesis equation went to as the period went off to infinity , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,198,0,0,1973.550,7,8,signalprocessing,so we have the analysis equation and synthesis equation , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,272,0,0,2684.680,15,16,signalprocessing,if we take that impulse train representation and simply plug it into the fourier transform synthesis equation what we end up with is the fourier series synthesis equation , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,277,0,0,2757.500,7,8,signalprocessing,if this expression is substituted into the synthesis equation for the fourier transform that will simply then reduce to the synthesis equation for the fourier series , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,101.310,5,6,signalprocessing,it of course involves a synthesis equation and an analysis equation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,107.040,1,2,signalprocessing,the synthesis equation expressing x of n the sequence in terms of the fourier transform and the analysis equation telling us how to obtain the fourier transform from the original sequence , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,12,0,0,122.890,12,13,signalprocessing,and i draw your attention again to the basic point that the synthesis equation essentially corresponds to decomposing the sequence as a linear combination of complex exponentials with amplitudes that are in effect proportional to the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,125,0,0,1330.730,12,13,signalprocessing,of course we could do it by attempting to go through the synthesis equation for the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,191,0,0,2044.580,4,5,signalprocessing,here is the general synthesis equation for the fourier series , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,198,0,0,2119.760,11,12,signalprocessing,so we've done it simply by essentially inspecting the fourier series synthesis equation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,264,0,0,2809.380,22,23,signalprocessing,we had then generalized that to the continuous time fourier transform and in effect in doing that what happened is that the synthesis equation in the fourier series became an integral relationship in the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,276,0,0,2956.290,19,20,signalprocessing,and we ended up with a relationship describing a representation for aperiodic discrete time signals in which now the synthesis equation went from a summation to an integration since the frequencies are now infinitesimally close involving frequencies only over a two pi interval and for which the amplitude factor x of omega well the amplitude factor is x of omega d omega divided by two pi , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,14,0,0,158.800,9,10,signalprocessing,and in what we had referred to as the synthesis equation the synthesis equation corresponded to in effect a decomposition as a linear combination a decomposition of x of t as a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,99,0,0,972.980,38,39,signalprocessing,and if you go through this and in fact you'll have an opportunity to go through this both in the video course manual and also it's carried through in the text what you end up with is a synthesis equation an expression for x of t in terms of x of s which corresponds to a synthesis equation , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,7,0,0,101.750,4,5,signalprocessing,so this was the synthesis equation , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,118,0,0,1414.260,8,9,signalprocessing,what i'll refer to as the fourier series synthesis equation is the equation that tells us how to build x t out of these complex exponentials , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,119,0,0,1428.340,4,5,signalprocessing,so we have the synthesis equation which is the one we started from , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,191,0,0,2043.480,9,10,signalprocessing,so here we have the expression which is the synthesis equation telling us how x t could be represented as complex exponentials if it can be , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,238,0,0,2477.140,8,9,signalprocessing,and so if we look again at the synthesis equation what we really want to ask is if we add up enough of these terms in what sense does this sum represent this time function , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,7,0,0,94.750,12,13,signalprocessing,and what that led to was what we referred to as the synthesis equation , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,139.110,7,8,signalprocessing,and so this equation together with the synthesis equation represent the fourier series description for periodic signals , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,39,0,0,452.280,5,6,signalprocessing,now let's look at the synthesis equation , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,43,0,0,497.440,3,4,signalprocessing,specifically then the synthesis equation that we have is what i've indicated here , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,46,0,0,542.740,13,14,signalprocessing,so the resulting equation that we get out of the original fourier series synthesis equation is the equation that i indicate down here x of t synthesized in terms of this integral which is what the fourier series approaches as omega zero goes to zero , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,49,0,0,589.930,9,10,signalprocessing,so we now have an analysis equation and a synthesis equation which in effect expresses for us how to build x of t in terms of infinitesimally finely spaced complex exponentials , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,69,0,0,826.300,18,19,signalprocessing,so what we have then is now our fourier transform representation the continuous time fourier transform with the synthesis equation expressed as an integral as i've indicated here and this integral is what the fourier series sum went to as we let the period go to infinity or the frequency go to zero , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,141,0,0,1650.860,5,6,signalprocessing,specifically here is then the synthesis equation for the fourier transform if we substitute this definition for the fourier transform of the periodic signal into this expression then when we do the appropriate bookkeeping and interchange the order of summation and integration the impulse integrates out to the exponential factor that we want , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,144,0,0,1687.990,15,16,signalprocessing,the two pis take care of each other and what we're left with is the synthesis equation for aperiodic signal in terms of the fourier transform or in terms of its fourier series coefficients , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,161,0,0,1913.210,71,72,signalprocessing,then the third step that we took was to inquire as to whether there is a fourier transform that can appropriately be defined for the periodic signal and the mechanism for doing that was to recognize that if we simply defined the fourier transform of the periodic signal as an impulse train where the impulse heights or areas were proportional to the fourier series coefficients then in fact the fourier transform synthesis equation reduced to the fourier series synthesis equation , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,0,0,105.350,1,2,signalprocessing,the synthesis equation being an equation the tells us how to build the time function out of in essence a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,68,0,0,723.790,7,8,signalprocessing,in particular if we look at the synthesis equation which i repeat here and the analysis equation which i repeat below it what we observe is that in fact these equations are basically identical except for the fact that in the top integral we have things as a function of omega in the bottom integral as a function of t and there's a factor of one over two pi and by the way a minus sign , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,134,0,0,1582.260,16,17,signalprocessing,well remember what i said at the beginning of the lecture when i pointed to the synthesis equation and i said in essence the synthesis equation tells us how to decompose x of t as a linear combination of complex exponentials ]

we let k vary outside the range from zero to n minus one what you can easily verify by substitution in here is that this sequence will in fact periodically repeat , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,174,0,0,1791.760,6,7,signalprocessing,and this is the fourier series synthesis equation where the equation below tells us how we

Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,226,0,0,2214.670,8,9,signalprocessing,basically if we substitute into the fourier transform analysis equation it's this sum that we evaluate , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,272,0,0,2684.680,15,16,signalprocessing,if we take that impulse train representation and simply plug it into the

essentially corresponds to decomposing the sequence as a linear combination of complex exponentials with amplitudes that are in effect proportional to the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,105,0,0,1140.650,17,18,signalprocessing,in particular let's think of a discrete time system that is described by a linear constant coefficient difference equation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,108,0,0,1178.720,7,8,signalprocessing,ok now let's consider a first order difference equation a system described by a first order difference equation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,125,0,0,1330.730,12,13,signalprocessing,of course we could do it by attempting to go through the synthesis equation for the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,132,0,0,1396.380,16,17,signalprocessing,here we have the impulse response for that associated with the system described by that particular difference equation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,138,0,0,1459.790,45,46,signalprocessing,so in fact a first order difference equation as we see has a frequency response depending on the value of a that either looks approximately like a lowpass filter for a positive or a highpass filter for a negative very much like the first order differential equation looked like a lowpass filter in the continuous time case , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,139,0,0,1483.710,21,22,signalprocessing,and in fact what i'd like to illustrate is the filtering characteristics or an example of filtering using a first order difference equation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,141,0,0,1512.030,13,14,signalprocessing,and we'll process the dow jones industrial average first through a first order difference equation where if we begin with a equals zero then referring to the frequency response that we have here a equals zero would simply be passing all frequencies , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,144,0,0,1548.270,27,28,signalprocessing,so let's watch the filtering first with a positive and we'll see it behave as a lowpass filter and then with a negative and we'll see the difference equation behaving as a highpass filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,148,0,0,1589.030,12,13,signalprocessing,and what we now want to do is process this through a difference equation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,149,0,0,1596.720,12,13,signalprocessing,above the dow jones average we show the impulse response of the difference equation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,169,0,0,1799.650,10,11,signalprocessing,ok so we see that in fact a first order difference equation is a filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,191,0,0,2044.580,4,5,signalprocessing,here is the general synthesis equation for the fourier series , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,198,0,0,2119.760,11,12,signalprocessing,so we've done it simply by essentially inspecting the fourier series synthesis equation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,261,0,0,2775.710,4,5,signalprocessing,and we saw an analysis equation which tells us how to get these fourier series coefficients through an integration on the original time function , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,264,0,0,2809.380,22,23,signalprocessing,we had then generalized that to the continuous time fourier transform and in effect in doing that what happened is that the synthesis equation in the fourier series became an integral relationship in the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,266,0,0,2855.850,7,8,signalprocessing,and we had of course the corresponding analysis equation that told us how to get x of omega , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,276,0,0,2956.290,19,20,signalprocessing,and we ended up with a relationship describing a representation for aperiodic discrete time signals in which now the synthesis equation went from a summation to an integration since the frequencies are now infinitesimally close involving frequencies only over a two pi interval and for which the amplitude factor x of omega well the amplitude factor is x of omega d omega divided by two pi , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,85,0,0,833.640,8,9,signalprocessing,and we have looked previously at the associated differential equation , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,91,0,0,891.480,5,6,signalprocessing,now we can write the differential equation for either of these systems and as we talked about last time in the last several lectures solve that equation using and exploiting the properties of the fourier transform , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,92,0,0,906.730,8,9,signalprocessing,and in fact if we look at the differential equation relating the capacitor output to the voltage source input we recognize that this is an example that in effect we've solved previously , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,93,0,0,921.740,13,14,signalprocessing,and so just working our way down applying the fourier transform to the differential equation and generating the system function by taking the ratio of the capacitor voltage or its fourier transform to the fourier transform of the source we then have the system function associated with the system for which the output is the capacitor voltage , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,195,0,0,1714.020,4,5,signalprocessing,so in fact the difference equation let's say for three point moving average would be the difference equation that i indicate here just simply taking a data point and the two data points adjacent to it and forming an average of those three , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,243,0,0,2149.530,7,8,signalprocessing,recursive filters are filters for which the difference equation has feedback from the output back into the input , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,245,0,0,2166.910,9,10,signalprocessing,so for example as i've stressed previously a recursive difference equation has the general form that i indicate here a linear combination of weighted outputs on the left hand side and linear combination of weighted inputs on the right hand side , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,247,0,0,2198.610,21,22,signalprocessing,for example just to interpret this focus on the interpretation of this as a filter let's look at a first order difference equation which we've talked about and generated the solution to previously , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,248,0,0,2212.770,4,5,signalprocessing,so the first order difference equation would be as i indicated here , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,253,0,0,2257.540,6,7,signalprocessing,and so interpreting the first order difference equation as a system what we're attempting to generate is the frequency response which is the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,254,0,0,2272.760,3,4,signalprocessing,and from the difference equation we can of course solve for either one of those by using the properties exploiting the properties of fourier transform , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,255,0,0,2283.770,6,7,signalprocessing,applying the fourier transform to the difference equation we will end up with the fourier transform of the output equal to the fourier transform of the input times this factor which we know from the convolution property in fact is the frequency response of the system , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,258,0,0,2317.910,14,15,signalprocessing,so we have the frequency response obtained by applying the fourier transform to the difference equation the impulse response , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,14,0,0,158.800,9,10,signalprocessing,and in what we had referred to as the synthesis equation the synthesis equation corresponded to in effect a decomposition as a linear combination a decomposition of x of t as a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,15,0,0,176.980,9,10,signalprocessing,and of course associated with this was the corresponding analysis equation that in effect gave us the amplitudes associated with the complex exponentials , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,99,0,0,972.980,38,39,signalprocessing,and if you go through this and in fact you'll have an opportunity to go through this both in the video course manual and also it's carried through in the text what you end up with is a synthesis equation an expression for x of t in terms of x of s which corresponds to a synthesis equation , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,50,0,0,536.010,9,10,signalprocessing,let's begin first of all with a first order differential equation , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,52,0,0,546.500,14,15,signalprocessing,what i mean by that is a system that's characterized by a first order differential equation , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,66,0,0,686.970,16,17,signalprocessing,so we have to decide which region of convergence that we pick and it's not the differential equation that will tell us that it's something else that has to give us that information , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,72,0,0,740.600,16,17,signalprocessing,so a very important point is that what we see is that the linear constant coefficient differential equation gives us the algebraic expression for the system function but does not tell us about the region of convergence , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,78,0,0,789.340,1,2,signalprocessing,the differential equation by itself does not completely specify the system it only essentially tells us what the algebraic expression is for the system function , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,80,0,0,801.950,10,11,signalprocessing,let's now look at a second order system and the differential equation that i picked in this case , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,82,0,0,814.150,6,7,signalprocessing,in particular it's a second order differential equation and i chosen just for simplicity to not include any derivatives on the right hand side although we could have , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,85,0,0,840.840,4,5,signalprocessing,that would convert this differential equation to an algebraic equation , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,7,0,0,101.750,4,5,signalprocessing,so this was the synthesis equation , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,0,0,105.430,7,8,signalprocessing,and of course there is the corresponding analysis equation , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,176,0,0,1783.260,9,10,signalprocessing,is the z transform associated with a second order difference equation , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,56,0,0,715.380,11,12,signalprocessing,so let's do that by first looking at a first order difference equation , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,57,0,0,722.480,7,8,signalprocessing,in the case of a first order difference equation which i've written as i indicate here , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,60,0,0,754.180,43,44,signalprocessing,so using those properties and together with the shifting property the property that tells us that the z transform of y of n minus one is z to the minus one times the z transform of y of n we then convert the difference equation to an algebraic expression , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,66,0,0,842.670,19,20,signalprocessing,well we have the same issue here as we had with the laplace transform namely the point that the difference equation tells us in essence what the algebraic expression is for the system function but doesn't specify the region of convergence , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,68,0,0,880.130,12,13,signalprocessing,if i let's say imposed on this system in addition to the difference equation the condition of causality then what that requires is that the impulse response be right sided or the region of convergence be outside the outermost pole , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,119,0,0,1401.960,26,27,signalprocessing,now if we want to map continuous time filters to discrete time filters then in continuous time we're talking about a system function and an associated differential equation , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,120,0,0,1417.840,12,13,signalprocessing,in discrete time there is the corresponding system function and the corresponding difference equation , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,135,0,0,1610.280,20,21,signalprocessing,the first one that i want to talk about is the more or less intuitive simple procedure of mapping a differential equation to a difference equation by simply replacing derivatives by differences , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,139,0,0,1644.870,4,5,signalprocessing,if we take the differential equation and do this with all the derivatives both in terms of y of t and x of t what we'll end up with is a difference equation , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,143,0,0,1684.740,17,18,signalprocessing,so in effect what it says is that every place in the system function or in the differential equation that we would be multiplying by s when laplace transformed , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,144,0,0,1696.460,2,3,signalprocessing,in the difference equation we would be multiplying by this factor , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,125.310,26,27,signalprocessing,and for example if n were equal to one then this would simply correspond to the magnitude squared of the frequency response for a first order differential equation , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,130,0,0,1573.570,31,32,signalprocessing,and let me just say quickly and in passing that although we won't go through this the notion that the bilinear transformation can be tied to the concept of taking the differential equation for the continuous time filter converting it to an integral equation by integrating enough times on both sides and then converting that to a difference equation by approximating the integrals with the trapezoidal rule , Lecture25FeedbackMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,290,0,0,2602.800,11,12,signalprocessing,ok so what we've seen in today's lecture is the basic analysis equation and a few of the applications , Lecture26FeedbackExampleTheInvertedPendulumMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,59,1,0,522.419,5,6,signalprocessing,so this is then the differential equation associated with the open loop system the basic dynamics of the system , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,27,0,0,322.520,25,29,signalprocessing,so let's begin with a discussion of discrete time signals and in particular the issue of how discrete time signals can be decomposed as a linear combination of delayed impulses , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,104,0,0,1277.060,31,35,signalprocessing,and correspondingly in the continuous time case we have the convolution integral which here is the sifting integral as we talked about representing x t in terms of itself as a linear combination of delayed impulses , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,225,0,0,2150.410,39,40,signalprocessing,but while we're on the accumulator i just want to draw your attention to the fact which will kind of come up in a variety of ways again later that we can rewrite the equation for an accumulator the difference equation by recognizing that we could in fact write the output as the accumulated values up to time n one and then add on the last value , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,227,0,0,2183.510,6,7,signalprocessing,and so we could rewrite this difference equation as y n y n one x n , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,229,0,0,2196.800,13,14,signalprocessing,expressed that way what that corresponds to is what is called a recursive difference equation , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,240,0,0,2264.630,4,5,signalprocessing,so we have a difference equation that describes for us how the impulse is related to the step , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,242,0,0,2281.420,21,22,signalprocessing,and so if we think of x two n as the input and y two n as the output then the difference equation for the inverse system is what i've indicated here , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,255,0,0,2380.200,12,13,signalprocessing,and let me just quickly point to one example which is a difference equation as i've indicated here , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,259,0,0,2436.550,7,8,signalprocessing,and likewise for a linear constant coefficient differential equation the specific one that i've indicated here under the assumption of initial rest the impulse response is e two t times u t , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,12,0,0,163.650,15,16,signalprocessing,well let's first consider what i refer to as an nth order linear constant coefficient differential equation as i've indicated here , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,18,0,0,222.410,13,14,signalprocessing,in the discrete time case the corresponding equation is a linear constant coefficient difference equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,20,0,0,242.630,8,9,signalprocessing,this equation is referred to an nth order difference equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,21,0,0,247.290,17,18,signalprocessing,the n referring to the number of delays of the output involved just as an nth order differential equation the n or the order of the equation refers to the number of derivatives of the output , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,24,0,0,299.910,4,5,signalprocessing,so in fact this differential equation by itself is not a unique specification of the system , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,27,0,0,324.630,5,6,signalprocessing,by simply substituting into the differential equation the sum of a particular and the homogeneous solution and what you'll see is that the homogeneous contribution in fact goes to zero by definition of what we mean by the homogeneous equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,28,0,0,344.670,9,10,signalprocessing,now the homogeneous solution for a linear constant coefficient differential equation is of the form that i indicate at the bottom , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,38,0,0,454.980,17,18,signalprocessing,so what this says is that in order to obtain the solution for a linear constant coefficient differential equation we need some kind of auxiliary information that tells us is how to obtain these n undetermined constants , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,40,0,0,477.930,6,7,signalprocessing,for example in addition to the differential equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,42,0,0,495.300,3,4,signalprocessing,and so the differential equation together with the auxiliary information the initial conditions then lets you determine the total solution which namely lets you determine these previously unspecified coefficients in the homogeneous solution , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,54,0,0,640.500,16,17,signalprocessing,ok well let's look at an example and let's take the example of a first order differential equation as i've indicated here , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,55,0,0,654.470,6,7,signalprocessing,so we have a first order differential equation dy t dt ay t is the input x t , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,69,0,0,768.540,10,11,signalprocessing,and you can verify that simply by substituting into the differential equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,80,0,0,883.960,26,27,signalprocessing,in essence we can consider two linear time invariant systems in cascade one a differentiator the other the system that we're talking about described by the differential equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,93,0,0,1019.290,19,20,signalprocessing,okay so what we've seen then is the impulse response for a system described by a linear constant coefficient differential equation where in addition we would impose causality linearity and time invariance essentially through the initial conditions of initial rest , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,95,0,0,1049.740,17,18,signalprocessing,in particular again let me remind you of the form of an nth order linear constant coefficient difference equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,98,0,0,1071.520,2,3,signalprocessing,once again difference equation is not a complete specification of the system because we can add to the response any homogeneous solution , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,99,0,0,1083.820,20,21,signalprocessing,in other words any solution that satisfies the homogeneous equation and the sum of those will also satisfy the original difference equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,100,0,0,1093.910,10,11,signalprocessing,so if we have a particular response that satisfies the difference equation then adding to that any response that is a solution to the homogeneous equation will also be a solution to the total equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,110,0,0,1201.990,10,11,signalprocessing,so the general form then for the solution to the difference equation is a sum of exponentials plus any particular solution , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,121,0,0,1312.210,26,27,signalprocessing,in fact one difference between them that in some sense makes difference equations easier to deal with in some situations is that in contrast to a differential equation a difference equation if we assume causality in fact is an explicit input output relationship for the system , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,123,0,0,1338.670,5,6,signalprocessing,let's consider the nth order difference equation as i've indicated here , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,132,0,0,1423.390,13,14,signalprocessing,well let's look at this specifically in the context of a first order difference equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,133,0,0,1430.160,6,7,signalprocessing,so let's take a first order difference equation as i've indicated here , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,136,0,0,1456.780,6,7,signalprocessing,we can rewrite the first order difference equation by taking the term involving y n one over two the right hand side of the equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,158,0,0,1645.750,17,18,signalprocessing,and now of course if we want to generate the more general set of solutions to this difference equation we can do that by adding all of the homogeneous solutions namely all the solutions that satisfy the homogeneous equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,172,0,0,1812.480,11,12,signalprocessing,let's now look at the difference equation and then later the differential equation interpreted in block diagram terms , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,173,0,0,1823.190,2,3,signalprocessing,now the difference equation as i just simply repeated here is y n x n ay n one where i've taken the delayed term over to the right hand side of the equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,184,0,0,1957.580,5,6,signalprocessing,well we know that the difference equation requires initial conditions , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,193,0,0,2062.960,2,3,signalprocessing,now the difference equation says that we want to take these and multiply them by the appropriate coefficients the coefficients in the difference equation and so we can do that as i've indicated here , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,200,0,0,2116.690,14,15,signalprocessing,which is a general block diagram for implementing or representing a linear constant coefficient difference equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,203,0,0,2141.680,12,13,signalprocessing,that it's only one of many possible algorithms or implementations for this difference equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,221,0,0,2290.180,17,18,signalprocessing,and one advantage simply stated is that when you think in terms of an implementation of a difference equation a delay corresponds to a storage register a memory location and by simply using the fact that we can interchange the order in which linear time invariant systems are cascaded we can reduce the amount of memory by a factor of two , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,225,0,0,2340.870,7,8,signalprocessing,so let's consider a linear constant coefficient differential equation as i've indicated here and i have terms on the left side and terms on the right side , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,226,0,0,2353.930,3,4,signalprocessing,and with the differential equation let's consider taking all the terms over to the right side of the equation except for the highest derivative in the output , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,237,0,0,2465.180,12,13,signalprocessing,so just as we did with the difference equation we've converted the differential equation to an integral equation and we have a block diagram form very similar to what we had in the case of the difference equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,245,0,0,2532.090,11,12,signalprocessing,and what you can see just as we saw with the difference equation is that now the integrators both integrators are integrating the same thing , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,250,0,0,2578.060,13,14,signalprocessing,very much similar to what we talked about in the case of the difference equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,251,0,0,2583.630,10,11,signalprocessing,now let's just again with the integral equation or the differential equation look at this somewhat more generally , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,252,0,0,2593.270,5,6,signalprocessing,again if we take the differential equation the general differential equation integrate it a sufficient number of times to convert it to an integral equation , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,260,0,0,2658.330,18,19,signalprocessing,so we've seen that the situation is very similar here as it was in the case of the difference equation , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,117,0,0,1400.540,12,13,signalprocessing,so that in effect then is what we refer to as the analysis equation the equation that begins with x t and tells us how to get the fourier series coefficients , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,118,0,0,1414.260,8,9,signalprocessing,what i'll refer to as the fourier series synthesis equation is the equation that tells us how to build x t out of these complex exponentials , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,119,0,0,1428.340,4,5,signalprocessing,so we have the synthesis equation which is the one we started from , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,120,0,0,1433.070,3,4,signalprocessing,we have the analysis equation which is the equation that we just developed , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,191,0,0,2043.480,9,10,signalprocessing,so here we have the expression which is the synthesis equation telling us how x t could be represented as complex exponentials if it can be , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,238,0,0,2477.140,8,9,signalprocessing,and so if we look again at the synthesis equation what we really want to ask is if we add up enough of these terms in what sense does this sum represent this time function , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,7,0,0,94.750,12,13,signalprocessing,and what that led to was what we referred to as the synthesis equation , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,0,0,123.090,15,16,signalprocessing,then the other side of the fourier series is what i referred to as the analysis equation , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,130.380,2,3,signalprocessing,and the analysis equation was the equation that told us how we get the fourier series coefficients from x of t , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,139.110,7,8,signalprocessing,and so this equation together with the synthesis equation represent the fourier series description for periodic signals , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,26,0,0,304.370,2,3,signalprocessing,and the analysis equation tells us what the relationship is for the coefficients in terms of the periodic signal , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,38,0,0,443.770,8,9,signalprocessing,and that in effect will correspond to an analysis equation to represent the aperiodic signal , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,39,0,0,452.280,5,6,signalprocessing,now let's look at the synthesis equation , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,43,0,0,497.440,3,4,signalprocessing,specifically then the synthesis equation that we have is what i've indicated here , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,46,0,0,542.740,13,14,signalprocessing,so the resulting equation that we get out of the original fourier series synthesis equation is the equation that i indicate down here x of t synthesized in terms of this integral which is what the fourier series approaches as omega zero goes to zero , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,48,0,0,576.900,8,9,signalprocessing,and we have then the corresponding fourier transform analysis equation which tells us how we arrive at that envelope in terms of x of t , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,49,0,0,589.930,9,10,signalprocessing,so we now have an analysis equation and a synthesis equation which in effect expresses for us how to build x of t in terms of infinitesimally finely spaced complex exponentials , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,69,0,0,826.300,18,19,signalprocessing,so what we have then is now our fourier transform representation the continuous time fourier transform with the synthesis equation expressed as an integral as i've indicated here and this integral is what the fourier series sum went to as we let the period go to infinity or the frequency go to zero , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,70,0,0,854.720,2,3,signalprocessing,the corresponding analysis equation which we have here , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,71,0,0,859.080,1,2,signalprocessing,the analysis equation being the expression for the envelope of the fourier series coefficients for the periodically replicated signal , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,141,0,0,1650.860,5,6,signalprocessing,specifically here is then the synthesis equation for the fourier transform if we substitute this definition for the fourier transform of the periodic signal into this expression then when we do the appropriate bookkeeping and interchange the order of summation and integration the impulse integrates out to the exponential factor that we want , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,144,0,0,1687.990,15,16,signalprocessing,the two pis take care of each other and what we're left with is the synthesis equation for aperiodic signal in terms of the fourier transform or in terms of its fourier series coefficients , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,161,0,0,1913.210,71,72,signalprocessing,then the third step that we took was to inquire as to whether there is a fourier transform that can appropriately be defined for the periodic signal and the mechanism for doing that was to recognize that if we simply defined the fourier transform of the periodic signal as an impulse train where the impulse heights or areas were proportional to the fourier series coefficients then in fact the fourier transform synthesis equation reduced to the fourier series synthesis equation , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,0,0,105.350,1,2,signalprocessing,the synthesis equation being an equation the tells us how to build the time function out of in essence a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,0,0,117.060,2,3,signalprocessing,and the analysis equation telling us how to get the amplitudes of those complex exponentials from the associated time function , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,68,0,0,723.790,7,8,signalprocessing,in particular if we look at the synthesis equation which i repeat here and the analysis equation which i repeat below it what we observe is that in fact these equations are basically identical except for the fact that in the top integral we have things as a function of omega in the bottom integral as a function of t and there's a factor of one over two pi and by the way a minus sign , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,134,0,0,1582.260,16,17,signalprocessing,well remember what i said at the beginning of the lecture when i pointed to the synthesis equation and i said in essence the synthesis equation tells us how to decompose x of t as a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,202,0,0,2341.400,14,15,signalprocessing,and we're also going to assume then it's characterized by a linear constant coefficient differential equation where we're going to impose the condition that it's causal linear and time invariant or equivalently that the initial conditions are consistent with the initial rest , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,204,0,0,2378.940,9,10,signalprocessing,so let's take as our example a first order differential equation as i indicate here , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,236,0,0,2636.240,30,31,signalprocessing,and given just the little bit of discussion that we had previously about filtering you should be able to infer something about the filtering characteristics of this simple first order differential equation , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,238,0,0,2668.160,43,44,signalprocessing,so in fact you could think of the defocusing that we did on the image of fourier you could think of that approximately as similar to the kind of filtering action that you would get by passing a signal through a first order differential equation , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,242,0,0,2721.930,10,11,signalprocessing,but let's do it instead by going back to the differential equation , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,243,0,0,2727.890,6,7,signalprocessing,and so here i'm taking a differential equation ]

Keyword = [Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,55,0,0,605.030,12,16,signalprocessing,so the unit impulse as we want to define it is the derivative of the unit step , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,60,0,0,655.440,18,22,signalprocessing,we have then the definition of the unit impulse function more or less formally defined as the first derivative of the unit step or thought of as the limiting form of the derivative of the approximation to the unit step in the limit as delta the duration of the discontinuity goes to zero , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,72,0,0,799.360,12,16,signalprocessing,it's mathematically not terribly comfortable because what we've done is taken the derivative of the unit step which has a discontinuity at the origin and there's some mathematical difficulties in doing that ]

Concept = SAR6
Keyword = [Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,119.610,13,13,signalprocessing,so basically what we attempted to do was decompose the input and then reconstruct the output through a linear combination of the outputs to those basic inputs , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,82,0,0,932.130,11,13,signalprocessing,and what i show here is the frequency response of an ideal lowpass filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,83,0,0,939.990,1,3,signalprocessing,the ideal lowpass filter of course passes exactly with a gain of one frequencies around zero and eliminates totally other frequencies , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,232,0,0,2463.320,13,15,signalprocessing,and it can be any approximation to a lowpass filter and even an ideal lowpass filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,235,0,0,2504.600,10,12,signalprocessing,this also says incidentally that if we look at an ideal lowpass filter and an ideal highpass filter and we choose the cutoff frequencies for comparison or the bandwidth of the filter to be equal , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,236,0,0,2524.650,2,4,signalprocessing,since this ideal highpass filter is this ideal lowpass filter with the frequency response shifted by pi the modulation property tells us that in the time domain what that corresponds to is an impulse response multiplied by minus one to the n , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,15,0,0,207.810,16,18,signalprocessing,so we have as you recall first of all the notion in continuous time of an ideal filter for example i illustrate here an ideal lowpass filter where we pass exactly frequency components in one band and reject totally frequency components in another band , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,31,0,0,329.960,5,7,signalprocessing,now let's look at these ideal filters and in particular the ideal lowpass filter in the time domain , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,32,0,0,339.320,7,9,signalprocessing,we have the frequency response of the ideal lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,34,0,0,349.580,14,16,signalprocessing,so here is the frequency response and below it the impulse response of the ideal lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,37,0,0,379.150,17,19,signalprocessing,and notice also since i want to refer back to this that the impulse response of an ideal lowpass filter in fact is non causal , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,40,0,0,401.680,6,8,signalprocessing,so the impulse response of the ideal lowpass filter is symmetric and continues to have tails off to plus and minus infinity , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,43,0,0,428.200,10,12,signalprocessing,so once again here is the frequency response of the ideal lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,57,0,0,564.300,7,9,signalprocessing,for example let's look back at the ideal lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,60,0,0,577.090,11,13,signalprocessing,let's now look at the step response of the discrete time ideal lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,64,0,0,599.100,10,12,signalprocessing,let's look at the step response of the continuous time ideal lowpass filter , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,96,1,0,528.280,11,12,signalprocessing,and this low pass filter is used in advance of the sampling process to basically reduce the artifacts that are introduced due to sampling , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,123.260,40,41,signalprocessing,and the second is the introduction and analysis of another kind of carriers specifically a pulse kind of carrier in continuous time leading to the notions of pulse amplitude modulation and eventually a very powerful theorem and result called the sampling theorem , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,137,0,0,1734.920,20,20,signalprocessing,and then as long as the frequency of the impulse train was such that i was able to do this reconstruction by simply low pass filtering then i would be able to demodulate , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,146,0,0,1851.960,17,17,signalprocessing,now there's a very important thing to observe here which is that the ability to do the reconstruction is associated with the notion of whether we can extract that central triangle , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,150,0,0,1902.470,11,11,signalprocessing,and in theory that doesn't affect our ability to do the reconstruction , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,167,0,0,2092.170,30,31,signalprocessing,and the resulting output of the modulator has a spectrum which is this original spectrum again replicated around each of these impulses in other words replicated in multiples of the sampling frequency now this is very much identical to the more general case , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,188,0,0,2405.520,14,14,signalprocessing,and that set of instantaneous samples in fact are sufficient to totally represent and reconstruct the signal , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,189,0,0,2414.280,13,14,signalprocessing,what in fact the formal statement that is is refer to as the sampling theorem a very powerful theorem that says if we're given equally spaced samples of a time function and if that time function is band limited and if the bandwidth and if the sampling frequency is chosen in the right way in relation to the bandwidth then in fact the original time function is uniquely recoverable with a low pass filter , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,190,0,0,2465.150,2,3,signalprocessing,now the sampling theorem is i would say a watershed or cornerstone of a lot of the discussion that we've been having for a whole variety of reasons , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,196,0,0,2529.520,12,13,signalprocessing,and when i'm all done converting back through the power of the sampling theorem converting back to a continuous time signal , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,197,0,0,2536.870,2,3,signalprocessing,so the sampling theorem provides us with a very major important bridge between continuous time and discrete time implementations and ideas , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,4,1,0,55.940,10,11,signalprocessing,we concluded the last lecture with the statement of the sampling theorem , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,5,1,0,59.960,7,8,signalprocessing,and just as a quick reminder the sampling theorem said that if we have a continuous time signal and we have equally spaced samples of that signal sampled at a sampling period which i indicate is capital t and if x of t is band limited in other words the fourier transform is zero outside some band where omega sub m is the highest frequency then under the condition that the sampling frequency which is two pi divided by the period is greater than twice the highest frequency , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,7,1,0,110.350,2,3,signalprocessing,and the sampling theorem essentially was derived by observing or using the notion that sampling could be done by multiplication or modulation with an impulse train , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,1,0,123.830,2,3,signalprocessing,and the sampling theorem developed by examining the consequence of the modulation property in the context of the fourier transform , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,16,1,0,230.040,5,6,signalprocessing,it essentially says that after sampling or modulation with an impulse train the resulting spectrum is the original spectrum added to itself shifted by integer multiples of the sampling frequency , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,21,1,0,321.430,12,12,signalprocessing,so the overall system then for doing the sampling and then the reconstruction of the original signal from the samples consists of multiplying the original time function by an impulse train , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,23,1,0,345.990,31,32,signalprocessing,the fourier transform i show here of the original signal and after modulation with the impulse train the resulting spectrum that we have is that replicated around integer multiples of the sampling frequency , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,24,1,0,364.460,12,13,signalprocessing,and then finally to recover the original signal or to generate a reconstructed signal we then multiply this in the frequency domain by the frequency response of an ideal low pass filter , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,26,1,0,388.290,20,20,signalprocessing,now in this picture an important point that i raised last time relates to the fact that in doing the reconstruction well we've assumed is that in replicating these individual versions of the original signal those replications don't overlap and so by passing this through a low pass filter in fact we can recover the original signal , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,30,1,0,440.530,8,9,signalprocessing,or equivalently what we require is that the sampling frequency be greater than twice the highest frequency in the original signal , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,34,1,0,479.710,4,5,signalprocessing,if in fact the sampling frequency is not high enough to avoid aliasing then what happens in that case is that the individual replications of the fourier transform of the original signal overlap and what we end up with is some distortion , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,37,1,0,524.810,4,5,signalprocessing,in other words the sampling frequency is not greater in this case than twice the highest frequency , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,49,1,0,618.190,30,31,signalprocessing,we then have samples of that and when we sample that and for this particular example it's sampled at ten kilohertz this spectrum is then replicated at multiples of the sampling frequency , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,51,1,0,646.620,5,5,signalprocessing,we then carry out a reconstruction with an ideal low pass filter , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,52,1,0,652.490,11,12,signalprocessing,and the ideal low pass filter is set at half the sampling frequency or five kilohertz , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,54,1,0,669.840,3,4,signalprocessing,and then the reconstructed signal is the output from the low pass filter which i denote as x of r of t , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,65,1,0,795.730,19,20,signalprocessing,and what we'll see in the first part of this movie is the input x of t and the reconstructed signal x of r of t without explicitly showing the samples , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,71,1,0,849.260,3,3,signalprocessing,now for the reconstruction we passed the samples through an ideal low pass filter , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,72,1,0,854.690,13,14,signalprocessing,i picked the cutoff frequency of the low pass filter at half the sampling frequency namely five kilohertz , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,73,1,0,861.530,9,10,signalprocessing,and here what we see is that the output reconstructed signal in fact matches in frequency the input signal , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,74,1,0,869.540,23,24,signalprocessing,now as we change the input frequency the reconstructed sinusoid is identical until we get to an input frequency which exceeds half the sampling frequency , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,77,1,0,901.310,18,19,signalprocessing,and as the input frequency decreases the output frequency increases until there's no aliasing and now the output reconstructed signal is equal to the input , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,82,1,0,944.430,37,38,signalprocessing,now what i'd like to show is the same reconstruction and input as i showed before but now let's look at the samples and what we'll see is that when there's aliasing even though the output the reconstructed signal is not identical to the input , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,83,1,0,964.690,12,13,signalprocessing,in fact it's consistent with the input samples that is sampling the reconstructed signal , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,84,1,0,971.620,37,38,signalprocessing,it gives a set of samples identical to the samples of the input and it's just that the interpolation in between those samples is an interpolation consistent with the assumed bandwidth of the input based on the sampling theorem , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,89,1,0,1008.970,11,12,signalprocessing,and notice of course that the samples of the input or reconstructed signal are identical , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,93,1,0,1036.970,22,23,signalprocessing,the interpolation in between the samples is identical because of the fact that the input frequency is still less than half the sampling frequency , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,94,1,0,1051.500,14,15,signalprocessing,and so as long as the input is frequency is less than half the sampling frequency not only will the samples be identical but also the reconstructed continuous waveform will match the input waveform , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,95,1,0,1076.820,7,8,signalprocessing,now when we get to half the sampling frequency we're just on the verge of aliasing , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,114,1,0,1244.280,17,18,signalprocessing,and recall that what should happen is that when the oscillator input frequency gets past half the sampling frequency we should hear aliasing , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,117,1,0,1266.850,11,12,signalprocessing,as long as the input frequency is less than half the sampling frequency in other words five kilohertz the reconstructed signal sounds identical to the input , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,124,1,0,1327.540,23,24,signalprocessing,so to summarize if we sample a signal and then reconstruct from the samples using a low pass filter as long as the sampling frequency is greater than twice the highest frequency in the signal we reconstruct exactly , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,125,1,0,1342.300,6,7,signalprocessing,if on the other hand the sampling frequency is too low , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,133,1,0,1437.790,27,28,signalprocessing,now in doing that of course as you can imagine it's important since we want an accurate representation of the original continuous time signal to choose the sampling frequency to very carefully avoid aliasing , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,346,1,0,2528.040,21,22,signalprocessing,but if you think of these impulses that we have in the frequency domain and we're aliasing as we change the sampling frequency what happens is that these impulses cross over and what that means is that we get a phase reversal depending on which phases are associated with which side of dc so that's kind of the idea of the phase reversal , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,397,1,0,2731.200,13,13,signalprocessing,and in particular what i'll be talking about is the interpretation of the reconstruction process not in the frequency domain but in a time domain and interpretation specifically associated with the concept of interpolating between the samples , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,4,0,0,55.220,3,4,signalprocessing,in discussing the sampling theorem we saw that for a band limited signal which is sampled at a frequency that is at least twice the highest frequency we can implement exact reconstruction of the original signal by low pass filtering an impulse train whose areas are identical to the sample values , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,0,0,108.810,21,21,signalprocessing,and in fact in today's lecture what i would like to do is first of all developed the interpretation of the reconstruction as an interpolation process and then also see how this exact interpolation using a low pass filter relates to other kinds of interpolation such as linear interpolation that you may already be familiar with , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,0,0,136.330,15,15,signalprocessing,well to begin let's again review what the overall system is for exact sampling and reconstruction , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,145.290,15,15,signalprocessing,and so let me remind you that the overall system for sampling and desampling or reconstruction is as i indicate here , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,154.040,1,2,signalprocessing,the sampling process consists of multiplying by an impulse train , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,12,0,0,158.960,3,3,signalprocessing,and then the reconstruction process corresponds to processing that impulse train with a low pass filter , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,14,0,0,182.020,5,5,signalprocessing,and this replicated spectrum for reconstruction is then processed through a low pass filter , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,17,0,0,216.920,3,4,signalprocessing,finally of the reconstructed signal which for the case of an ideal low pass filter is exactly equal to the spectrum of the original signal , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,18,0,0,228.160,11,11,signalprocessing,now that is the frequency domain picture of the sampling and reconstruction , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,26,0,0,303.410,3,3,signalprocessing,now in the reconstruction we process that impulse train with a low pass filter , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,27,0,0,310.940,6,6,signalprocessing,that's the basic notion of the reconstruction , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,28,0,0,313.880,7,8,signalprocessing,and so in the time domain the reconstructed signal is related to the impulse train of samples through a convolution with the filter impulse response , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,30,0,0,348.790,8,9,signalprocessing,and finally then in the time domain the reconstructed signal is simply a linear combination of shifted versions of the impulse response with amplitudes which are the sample values , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,31,0,0,365.080,10,10,signalprocessing,and so this expression in fact then is our basic reconstruction expression in the time domain , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,34,0,0,400.310,21,21,signalprocessing,and then i've shown here what might be a typical impulse response particularly typical in the case where we're talking about reconstruction with an ideal low pass filter , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,35,0,0,413.280,5,5,signalprocessing,now what happens in the reconstruction is that the convolution of these impulses with this impulse response means that in the reconstruction we superimpose one of these impulse responses whatever the filter impulse response happens to be at each of these time instance , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,37,0,0,440.310,6,7,signalprocessing,and that gives us the total reconstructed signal , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,47,0,0,509.000,7,8,signalprocessing,and then below that will be the reconstructed signal , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,48,0,0,513.500,2,2,signalprocessing,and the reconstruction will be carried out by showing the location of the impulse response as it moves along in the wave form , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,51,0,0,533.930,12,12,signalprocessing,for the particular case of an ideal low pass filter for the reconstruction placed successively at the locations of these impulses , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,54,0,0,554.490,9,10,signalprocessing,and the summation of those will then be the reconstructed signal , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,55,0,0,558.740,10,10,signalprocessing,so let's take a look at first of all that reconstruction where the impulse response corresponds to the impulse response of an ideal low pass filter , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,56,0,0,569.800,15,15,signalprocessing,shown here first is the continuous time signal which we want to sample and then reconstruct using band limited interpolation or equivalently ideal low pass filtering on the set of samples , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,61,0,0,609.420,14,14,signalprocessing,and it's this set of samples that we then want to use for the reconstruction , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,62,0,0,614.490,1,1,signalprocessing,the reconstruction process interpreted as interpolation , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,68,0,0,654.330,9,9,signalprocessing,and in the bottom curve we'll build up the reconstruction as those sine x over x functions are added together , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,70,0,0,664.470,20,20,signalprocessing,and we see there the sine x over x function on the bottom curve is the first step in the reconstruction , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,85,0,0,762.260,6,6,signalprocessing,and let me stress that this reconstruction process by putting the impulses through a filter follows this relationship whether or not this impulse response in fact corresponds to an ideal low pass filter , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,87,0,0,802.220,4,4,signalprocessing,now the kind of reconstruction that we've just talked about , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,88,0,0,807.120,3,3,signalprocessing,and the ideal reconstruction is often referred to as band limited interpolation because we're interpolating in between the samples by making the assumption that the signal is band limited and using the impulse response for an ideal low pass filter which has a cut off frequency consistent with the assumed bandwidth for the signal , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,95,0,0,883.610,2,2,signalprocessing,and the reconstruction that we end up in that case will look something like this , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,99,0,0,916.910,7,7,signalprocessing,and in that case the type of reconstruction that we would get would look something like i indicate here where we take a sample value and the following sample value and simply fit an interpolated curve between them which is a straight line , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,102,0,0,965.520,33,33,signalprocessing,specifically if we consider a system where the impulse response is a rectangular function then in fact if we processed the train of samples through a filter with this impulse response exactly the reconstruction that we would get is what i've shown here , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,116,0,0,1125.070,18,18,signalprocessing,and then finally below that the accumulation of those impulse responses or equivalently the convolution or equivalently the reconstruction , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,168,0,0,1531.890,9,9,signalprocessing,and so this in fact when we're doing the reconstruction with a zero order hold is the associated frequency response , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,176,0,0,1617.990,14,14,signalprocessing,here is the zero order hold corresponding to generating a box car kind of reconstruction , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,180,0,0,1657.830,13,13,signalprocessing,well to illustrate some of these ideas and the notion of doing a reconstruction with a zero order hold or first order hold and then in fact adding to that some additional low pass filtering what i'd like to do is demonstrate or illustrate sampling and interpolation in the context of some images , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,185,0,0,1709.350,14,14,signalprocessing,so let's begin with the original image which we then want to sample and reconstruct , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,194,0,0,1776.620,8,8,signalprocessing,and this then is not too bad a reconstruction , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,195,0,0,1780.340,4,4,signalprocessing,so that's an approximate reconstruction , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,207,0,0,1867.930,18,18,signalprocessing,and you can begin to see that with the zero order hold plus the low pass filtering the reconstruction is not that bad , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,211,0,0,1893.310,11,11,signalprocessing,and you can begin to see that this is a reasonable reconstruction , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,217,0,0,1938.430,7,7,signalprocessing,and you can see now that the reconstruction is somewhat smoother because of the fact that we're using an impulse response that's somewhat smoother or a corresponding frequency response that has a sharper cut off , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,232,0,0,2049.920,6,6,signalprocessing,and that again is a smoother reconstruction consistent with the fact that the triangles are smoother than the rectangles , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,241,0,0,2139.400,6,7,signalprocessing,well it turns out that the sampling theorem in fact as i've indicated previously provides us with a very nice mechanism for converting our continuous time signals into discrete time signals , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,248,0,0,2254.680,22,23,signalprocessing,the two steps are to first convert from the continuous time or continuous time continuous signal to an impulse train through a sampling process and then to convert that impulse train to a discrete time sequence , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,265,0,0,2457.600,14,15,signalprocessing,and finally what we end up with then is a fourier transform after the sampling process which is the original fourier transform of the continuous signal but added to itself shifted by integer multiples of the sampling frequency , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,311,0,0,2896.110,1,2,signalprocessing,after sampling with an impulse train this spectrum retains its shape but is replicated at integer multiples of the sampling frequency two pi over capital t as i indicate here , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,315,0,0,2925.590,10,11,signalprocessing,it's periodic with a period which is equal to the sampling frequency , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,323,0,0,3015.780,13,14,signalprocessing,corresponding in the frequency domain we have replicated the spectrum through the initial sampling process and then rescaled the frequency axis so that in fact now this periodicity corresponds to a periodicity here which is two pi and here which is the sampling frequency , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,324,0,0,3037.870,44,45,signalprocessing,so very often in fact and we'll be doing this next time when you think of continuous time signals which have been converted to discrete time signals when you look at the discrete time frequency axis the frequency two pi is associated with the sampling frequency as it was applied to the original continuous time signal , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,329,0,0,3128.390,20,21,signalprocessing,and what that means in the frequency domain in terms of taking the original spectrum replicating it because of the sampling process and then rescaling that so that the periodicity gets rescaled so that it's periodic with a period of two pi , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,17,0,0,242.020,7,8,signalprocessing,so the overall process then is a sampling process followed by what is simply in this box a re labeling process , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,24,0,0,323.950,17,18,signalprocessing,in the frequency domain then we had the spectrum of the original signal which because of the sampling process is replicated at integer multiples of the sampling frequency omega sub s or two pi over capital t and then in converting the impulses to a sequence we are essentially normalizing the frequency axis so that the frequency two pi over capital t gets re labeled as two pi , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,29,0,0,395.470,5,6,signalprocessing,which is of course the sampling frequency which gets normalized to the frequency two pi , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,35,0,0,471.400,18,19,signalprocessing,and the overall system of course as i've stressed several times in the past consists of first the sampling process conversion to an impulse train and the impulse train converted to a sequence , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,39,0,0,517.980,22,23,signalprocessing,and then finally we carry out the desampling process by simply using a low pass filter with a cutoff associated with the sampling frequency that we used , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,42,0,0,560.160,11,12,signalprocessing,although a fairly typical thing to do in addition to this sampling process is to include what is referred to an anti aliasing filter , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,43,0,0,573.440,18,19,signalprocessing,in other words this is a filter that would band limit the input at at least half the sampling frequency so that we are guaranteed then that there is no aliasing that's carried out in this process , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,44,0,0,590.400,37,37,signalprocessing,and it's important to stress that in this kind of processing discreet time processing of continuous time signals except in certain special situations it's very important to avoid aliasing because we're going to want to do a reconstruction after we do the sampling and processing , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,51,0,0,647.460,1,2,signalprocessing,after sampling that spectrum is replicated at multiples of the sampling frequency integer multiples of the sampling frequency and so there would be another one over here and another one over here et cetera , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,52,0,0,661.380,18,19,signalprocessing,and then in converting to a discreet time sequence there is the associated frequency normalization so that the sampling frequency gets normalized to a frequency of two pi , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,79,0,0,959.470,11,11,signalprocessing,and then because of the associated low pass filtering and the reconstruction we would select out just one of these periods in particular the portion around the origin , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,84,0,0,1001.750,36,37,signalprocessing,and by the way plant away for now and we'll return to this point later the observation that even if the digital filter frequency response is fixed which we would assume it is by changing the sampling frequency in fact what we're able to do is affect a linear scaling all of the equivalent continuous time filter , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,94,0,0,1127.250,20,21,signalprocessing,and as i'll stress again shortly remember that in the frequency normalization or unnormalization two pi represents in effect the sampling frequency , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,95,0,0,1138.940,23,24,signalprocessing,and so the consequence of that is that the cutoff frequency really is going to be associated with a ten th of the sampling frequency , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,107,0,0,1289.150,13,13,signalprocessing,and then the result of that is low pass filtered to do the reconstruction , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,108,0,0,1294.590,10,10,signalprocessing,so what we'll want to look at then is that reconstruction first with just an impulse input , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,134,0,0,1502.070,20,21,signalprocessing,and one consequence of that is that in fact if we sweep the input sinusoid only up to half the sampling frequency we'll see no aliasing , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,137,0,0,1528.790,5,6,signalprocessing,that means based on the sampling theorem that as long as the input frequency is below ten kilohertz we get no aliasing , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,165,0,0,1798.360,22,23,signalprocessing,now if we increase the sweep range from ten kilohertz the twenty kilohertz so that the sweep range is equal to the sampling frequency in essence that corresponds to sweeping out the digital filter from zero to two pi , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,170,0,0,1865.070,72,73,signalprocessing,now an important observation is that with the digital or discreet time filter cutoff frequency fixed as i've indicated here and i remind you that what the cutoff frequency is is a ten th of two pi with that cutoff frequency fixed because of the normalization that we get as we come back to a continuous time filter in fact what we have is a cutoff frequency that is dependent on the sampling frequency or on the sampling period , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,172,0,0,1906.580,33,34,signalprocessing,filter or has a cutoff frequency which is a ten th of two pi the normalization as you recall is that two pi in discreet time frequency corresponds to omega sub s the sampling frequency in terms of continuous time frequency , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,173,0,0,1925.180,28,29,signalprocessing,the consequence is that this cutoff frequency in fact is one point ten of not two pi now because of the normalization it's one point ten of the sampling frequency , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,174,0,0,1940.180,6,7,signalprocessing,so consequently as we change the sampling frequency what will happen is that even with the discreet time filter cutoff fixed the cutoff frequency of the equivalent continuous time filter will change , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,177,0,0,1969.480,8,9,signalprocessing,and we are going to be changing the sampling frequency and so keep in mind that as we look at this as the input frequency sweeps past half the sampling frequency whatever sampling frequency we happen to be looking at then because of the fact that there's no anti aliasing filter we'll get aliasing , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,178,0,0,1994.360,31,32,signalprocessing,in other words the frequency and the digital filter or discreet time filter as we sweep the input frequency up will move up in frequency until we get past half the sampling frequency and then essentially will move back down in frequency , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,180,0,0,2013.570,17,18,signalprocessing,or what we'll see are periodic replications of the frequency response when we swept past half the sampling frequency , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,182,0,0,2025.440,8,9,signalprocessing,but the frequency response as we change the sampling frequency , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,183,0,0,2032.980,13,14,signalprocessing,now what we would like to demonstrate is the effect of changing the sampling frequency , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,184,0,0,2038.450,13,14,signalprocessing,and we know that the effective filter cutoff frequency is tied to the sampling frequency and for this particular filter corresponds to a ten th of the sampling frequency , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,185,0,0,2052.719,5,6,signalprocessing,consequently if we double the sampling frequency we should double the effective filter passband width or double the filter cutoff frequency , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,187,0,0,2065.100,12,13,signalprocessing,again a zero to ten kilohertz sweep range but a forty kilohertz sampling frequency , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,189,0,0,2083.469,7,8,signalprocessing,now let's begin to decrease the filter sampling frequency , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,190,0,0,2087.889,6,7,signalprocessing,so from forty let's change the sampling frequency to twenty kilohertz , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,193,0,0,2107.710,4,5,signalprocessing,we can cut the sampling frequency down to ten kilohertz , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,197,0,0,2129.240,6,7,signalprocessing,and now let's cut down the sampling frequency even further to five kilohertz , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,200,0,0,2149.390,10,11,signalprocessing,all right so that illustrates the effect of changing the sampling frequency , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,201,0,0,2154.610,10,11,signalprocessing,now let's conclude this demonstration of the effect of the sampling frequency on the filter cutoff frequency by carrying out some filtering on some live audio , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,205,0,0,2197.080,7,8,signalprocessing,so let's begin with a forty kilohertz sampling frequency or an effective filter cutoff frequency of four kilohertz , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,206,0,0,2209.950,7,8,signalprocessing,now let's reduce that a twenty kilohertz sampling frequency or a two kilohertz filter , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,207,0,0,2220.090,4,5,signalprocessing,then a ten kilohertz sampling frequency , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,208,0,0,2227.950,5,6,signalprocessing,and finally a five kilohertz sampling frequency corresponding to a five hundred cycle equivalent analog filter , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,209,0,0,2240.280,16,17,signalprocessing,alright now let's finally conclude by returning to a little higher quality ragtime by changing the sampling frequency back to forty kilohertz , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,217,0,0,2361.170,24,25,signalprocessing,where in fact one step that we might want to take in addition to the steps so we've talked about here is an additional sampling process following whatever kinds of filtering that we do , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,4,0,0,60.760,13,14,signalprocessing,and as you know the basis for that arises essentially out of a sampling theorem , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,13,0,0,172.950,7,8,signalprocessing,so the basic block diagram for the sampling process is to modulate or multiply the sequence that we want to sample by an impulse train , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,30,0,0,337.970,17,18,signalprocessing,in other words what we're doing very much as we did in continuous time is through the sampling process when we look at it in the frequency domain taking the spectrum of the sequence there were sampling and shifting it and then adding it in shifting it by integer multiples of the sampling frequency , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,31,0,0,358.900,29,30,signalprocessing,in particular looking back at this equation what we recognize is that this term k times two pi over capital n is in fact an integer multiple of the sampling frequency , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,33,0,0,377.260,12,13,signalprocessing,this is k times omega sub s where omega sub s the sampling frequency is two pi divided by capital n , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,39,0,0,430.810,6,7,signalprocessing,and now the spectrum of the sampling signal is what i show below which is an impulse train with impulses occurring at integer multiples of the sampling frequency , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,44,0,0,480.570,3,4,signalprocessing,and so the sampling frequency omega sub s is two pi divided by three , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,45,0,0,489.740,38,39,signalprocessing,now when we look at this what we recognize is that we have basically the same issue here as we had in continuous time in the sense that when these individual replications of the fourier transform when the sampling frequency is chosen high enough so that they don't overlap then we see the potential for being able to get one of them back , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,64,0,0,710.320,10,10,signalprocessing,this is now processed through a filter which for exact reconstruction is an ideal low pass filter , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,73,0,0,767.550,23,23,signalprocessing,consequently the sample sequence is an impulse train whose values are samples of x of at integer multiples of capital n for the reconstruction this is now processed through an ideal low pass filter , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,75,0,0,793.900,3,4,signalprocessing,and so the reconstructed signal is the convolution of the sample sequence and the filter impulse response , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,77,0,0,809.250,7,7,signalprocessing,and so it says then that the reconstruction is carried out by replacing the impulses here these impulses by versions of the filter impulse response , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,79,0,0,838.840,12,12,signalprocessing,and that is the interpolation in between the samples to do the reconstruction , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,82,0,0,882.400,3,4,signalprocessing,now in this sampling process if we look again at the wave forms involved or sequences involved the process consisted of taking a sequence and extracting from it individual values , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,98,0,0,1023.860,50,51,signalprocessing,now in talking about a decimated sequence we could of course do that directly from this step down to here although again in the analysis it will be somewhat more convenient to carry that out by thinking at least analytically in terms of a two step process one being a sampling process then the other being a decimation , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,147,0,0,1501.380,14,15,signalprocessing,and in particular in going through this part of the process we choose the sampling rate for going from the continuous time signal to the sequence so that we don't violate the sampling theorem , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,150,0,0,1531.200,4,5,signalprocessing,and i've chosen the sampling frequency to be just high enough so that i avoid aliasing , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,151,0,0,1541.350,6,7,signalprocessing,well that then is the lowest sampling frequency i can pick , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,171,0,0,1764.890,31,31,signalprocessing,and that would consist of converting the decimated sequence back to an impulse train and then processing that impulse train by an ideal low pass filter to do the interpolation or reconstruction filling in the values which in this impulse train are equal to zero , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,183,0,0,1879.950,19,19,signalprocessing,and then finally we interpolate between the non zero values here by going through a low pass filter to reconstruct the original sequence , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,188,0,0,1916.400,3,4,signalprocessing,then through the sampling process that is periodically replicated , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,189,0,0,1920.910,9,10,signalprocessing,again this is drawn on the assumption that the sampling frequency is pi or the sampling period is equal to two , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,204,0,0,2066.530,8,9,signalprocessing,and the different system has a different assumed sampling frequency or sampling period , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,206,0,0,2076.630,16,17,signalprocessing,we have let's say a continuous time signal which we've converted to a sequence through a sampling process using an assumed sampling period of t one , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,214,0,0,2140.660,30,31,signalprocessing,and so a very common issue and it comes up as i indicated particularly in digital audio a very common issue is to be able to convert from one assumed sampling period t one our sampling frequency to another assumed sampling period , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,223,0,0,2217.520,12,13,signalprocessing,now we might have an alternative situation where in fact the new sampling period or the sampling period of the output is half the sampling period of the input corresponding to an assumed sampling frequency which is twice as high , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,51,0,0,585.820,8,9,signalprocessing,and for a choice of parameter there's a sampling frequency of course involved in this process , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,52,0,0,591.910,8,9,signalprocessing,and the value that i'll pick for the sampling frequency is ten kilohertz , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,71,0,0,801.590,3,4,signalprocessing,in particular the sampling frequency gets mapped to two pi , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,73,0,0,814.500,11,12,signalprocessing,so one kilohertz which is a one point ten of the sampling frequency would then convert to a discrete time frequency of zero point two pi , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,80,0,0,927.710,53,54,signalprocessing,now this is a fairly subtle complicated tongue twisting issue but the bottom line on it the essential point is that the parameter capital t that we use in impulse invariant design is a totally different unrelated and in fact as it turns out arbitrary parameter which is not necessarily pegged to the sampling frequency , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,111,0,0,1342.960,14,15,signalprocessing,that discrete time filter to be used in a system which has an associated sampling frequency which is ten kilohertz , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,207,0,0,2524.380,44,45,signalprocessing,ok now this was a fairly rapid trip through a number of issues in particular some of the issues associated with the bilinear transformation and also this issue of how you pick this parameter capital t and how it might be associated with a sampling frequency if you're doing discrete time processing of continuous time signals ]

Concept = DTFT322
Keyword = [Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,20,0,0,228.930,24,25,signalprocessing,and also by the way as it developed later that frequency response as you should now recognize from this expression is in fact the fourier transform the continuous time fourier transform of the system impulse response , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,21,0,0,246.170,19,20,signalprocessing,and the notion of decomposing a signal as a linear combination of these complex exponentials is what first the fourier series representation and then later the fourier transform representation corresponded to , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,33,0,0,398.340,14,15,signalprocessing,this particular expression in fact will correspond to what we'll refer to as the fourier transform the discrete time fourier transform of the system impulse response , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,64,0,0,747.580,15,16,signalprocessing,so in fact in place of this expression it will be common in writing the fourier series expression to write it as i've indicated here where the implication is that these fourier coefficients periodically repeat as k continues to repeat outside the interval from zero to n minus one , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,65,0,0,769.370,26,27,signalprocessing,and so this notation in fact says that what we're going to use is k ranging over one period of this periodic sequence which is the fourier series coefficients , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,66,0,0,787.730,9,10,signalprocessing,so the expression that we have then for the fourier series i've repeated here , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,83,0,0,913.750,18,19,signalprocessing,now there is a real difference between the way those equations look and the way the continuous time fourier series looked , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,89,0,0,976.050,17,18,signalprocessing,so we have then to summarize the synthesis equation and the analysis equation for the discrete time fourier series , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,109,0,0,1195.670,9,10,signalprocessing,ok well let's look at an example of the fourier series representation for a particular signal , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,114,0,0,1233.370,6,7,signalprocessing,and if we look at the fourier series coefficients we can either look at it in terms of real and imaginary parts or magnitude and angle , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,116,0,0,1250.150,20,21,signalprocessing,and let me draw your attention to the fact that i've drawn this to specifically illuminate the periodicity of the fourier series coefficients with a period of capital n , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,121,0,0,1287.500,8,9,signalprocessing,and then because of the periodicity of the fourier series coefficients this simply periodically repeats , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,128,0,0,1344.090,4,5,signalprocessing,and i've expressed the fourier series coefficients which are algebraically developed in the text , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,129,0,0,1350.340,3,4,signalprocessing,i've expressed the fourier series coefficients as samples of an envelope function , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,132,0,0,1372.850,18,19,signalprocessing,which is the continuous time square wave where with the continuous times square wave the form of the fourier series coefficients was as samples of what we refer to as a sin x over x function , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,133,0,0,1391.050,14,15,signalprocessing,now the sin nx over sin x function which is the envelope of the fourier series coefficients for the discrete time periodic square wave plays the role and we'll see it very often in discrete time that sin x over x does in continuous time , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,134,0,0,1411.080,26,27,signalprocessing,and in fact we should understand right from the beginning that the sin x over x envelope couldn't possibly be the envelope of the discrete time fourier series coefficients , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,138,0,0,1439.710,27,28,signalprocessing,so once again if we look back at the algebraic expression that i have it's samples of the sin nx over sine x function that represent the fourier series coefficients of this periodic square wave , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,139,0,0,1456.160,21,22,signalprocessing,now in the representation in the continuous time case we essentially had used the concept of an envelope to represent the fourier series coefficients and the notion that the fourier series coefficients were samples of an envelope , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,143,0,0,1504.280,10,11,signalprocessing,these samples of this envelope function would then represent the fourier series coefficients , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,144,0,0,1512.340,23,24,signalprocessing,if we increased the period then we would simply have a finer spacing on the samples of the envelope function to get the fourier series coefficients , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,147,0,0,1543.810,8,9,signalprocessing,as the period increases we can view the fourier series coefficients as samples of an envelope , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,150,0,0,1566.140,23,24,signalprocessing,and recall also that this was essentially the trick that we used in continuous time to allow us to develop or utilize the fourier series to provide a representation of aperiodic signals as a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,152,0,0,1607.110,13,14,signalprocessing,and then we developed the notion that since the periodic signal has a fourier series and since as the period of the periodic signal increases and goes to infinity the periodic signal represents the aperiodic signal , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,153,0,0,1626.520,3,4,signalprocessing,then essentially the fourier series provides us with a representation , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,160,0,0,1687.310,10,11,signalprocessing,and as the period goes off to infinity it's the fourier series representation of the periodic signal that provides a representation of the aperiodic signal , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,173,0,0,1775.590,7,8,signalprocessing,specifically here is our representation through the fourier series of the here is a representation through the envelope function , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,174,0,0,1791.760,4,5,signalprocessing,and this is the fourier series synthesis equation where the equation below tells us how we get these fourier coefficients or the envelope from x of n , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,186,0,0,1875.210,9,10,signalprocessing,and as n goes to infinity then what the fourier series becomes is the fourier transform as summarized by the bottom two equations , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,190,0,0,1909.230,4,5,signalprocessing,in which case the fourier series coefficients become these envelopes functions , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,192,0,0,1919.890,9,10,signalprocessing,so what we have then is the discrete time fourier transform which is a representation of an aperiodic signal , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,194,0,0,1941.470,7,8,signalprocessing,and this is the integral that the fourier series synthesis equation went to as the period went off to infinity , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,195,0,0,1952.800,16,17,signalprocessing,and we have the corresponding analysis equation which is shown below where this tells us the fourier transform , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,196,0,0,1961.180,6,7,signalprocessing,in effect the envelope or the fourier series coefficients of that periodic signal , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,202,0,0,2007.350,1,2,signalprocessing,it's fourier transform x of omega is a function of a continuous variable , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,207,0,0,2029.270,8,9,signalprocessing,however in the frequency domain remember that the fourier series coefficients were always periodic , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,212,0,0,2077.480,9,10,signalprocessing,all right notationally we'll again represent the discrete time fourier transform pair as i indicated here , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,218,0,0,2134.110,7,8,signalprocessing,as the period goes to infinity the fourier transform of this is represented by the envelope of those fourier series coefficients and that was our sin nx over sin x function which in this particular case for these particular numbers is sin five omega over two divided by sin omega over two , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,226,0,0,2214.670,6,7,signalprocessing,basically if we substitute into the fourier transform analysis equation it's this sum that we evaluate , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,232,0,0,2263.330,11,12,signalprocessing,and let's in particular focus on what the magnitude of the fourier transform looks like , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,236,0,0,2289.090,7,8,signalprocessing,and the periodicity is inherent in the fourier transform in discrete time so we really might only need to look at this either from minus pi to pi or from zero to two pi , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,243,0,0,2358.500,4,5,signalprocessing,now we developed the fourier transform by beginning with the fourier series , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,246,0,0,2372.920,4,5,signalprocessing,is now absorb the fourier series within the broader framework of the fourier transform , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,247,0,0,2381.540,7,8,signalprocessing,and there are two relationships between the fourier series and the fourier transform which are identical to relationships that we had in the continuous time case , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,248,0,0,2394.250,23,24,signalprocessing,let me remind you that in continuous time we had the statement that if we have a periodic signal that in fact the fourier series coefficients of that periodic signal is proportional to samples of the fourier transform of one period , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,249,0,0,2423.140,25,26,signalprocessing,well in fact let me remind you flows easily from all the things that we built up so far because of the fact that the fourier transform essentially by definition of the way we developed it is what we get as the fourier series coefficients as we focus on one period and then let the period go off to infinity , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,250,0,0,2451.050,6,7,signalprocessing,well looking at one period the fourier transform of that then is the envelope of the fourier series coefficients , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,254,0,0,2500.790,10,11,signalprocessing,if we have a periodic signal and we consider the fourier transform of one period the fourier series coefficients of this periodic signal are in fact samples as stated mathematically in the bottom equation samples of the fourier transform of one period , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,255,0,0,2527.340,6,7,signalprocessing,so x of omega is the fourier transform of one period , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,256,0,0,2531.180,5,6,signalprocessing,a sub k's are the fourier series coefficients of the periodic signal , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,260,0,0,2565.690,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier transform of one period in fact represents the envelope , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,262,0,0,2577.180,5,6,signalprocessing,represents the envelope of the fourier series coefficients , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,263,0,0,2582.520,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier series coefficients are samples , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,264,0,0,2588.390,11,12,signalprocessing,so what we have then is a relationship back to the fourier series coefficients from the fourier transform that tells us that for a periodic signal now the periodic signal the fourier series coefficients are related are samples of the fourier transform of one period , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,265,0,0,2611.920,28,29,signalprocessing,now finally to kind of bring things back in a circle and exactly identical to what we did in the continuous time case we can finally absorb the fourier series in discrete time , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,266,0,0,2627.310,9,10,signalprocessing,we can absorb it into the framework of the fourier transform , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,270,0,0,2658.150,7,8,signalprocessing,the periodic signal is represented through a fourier series and fourier series coefficients , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,271,0,0,2664.360,19,20,signalprocessing,essentially what i pointed out at that time was that if we define take it as a definition the fourier transform of the periodic signal as an impulse train where the amplitudes of the impulses are proportional to the fourier series coefficients , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,272,0,0,2684.680,13,14,signalprocessing,if we take that impulse train representation and simply plug it into the fourier transform synthesis equation what we end up with is the fourier series synthesis equation , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,273,0,0,2704.860,13,14,signalprocessing,so in continuous time we had used this definition of the continuous time fourier transform of a periodic signal , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,276,0,0,2739.810,11,12,signalprocessing,so in discrete time if we have a periodic signal the fourier transform of that periodic signal is defined as an impulse train where the amplitudes of the impulses are proportional to the fourier series coefficients , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,277,0,0,2757.500,11,12,signalprocessing,if this expression is substituted into the synthesis equation for the fourier transform that will simply then reduce to the synthesis equation for the fourier series , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,279,0,0,2790.740,10,11,signalprocessing,here is the periodic signal and below it are the fourier series coefficients where i've removed the envelope function and just indicate the amplitudes of the coefficients indexed of course on the coefficient number , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,281,0,0,2809.550,7,8,signalprocessing,and if instead of talking about the fourier series coefficients what i want to talk about is the fourier transform the fourier transform in essence corresponds to simply redrawing that using impulses and using an axis that is essentially indexed on the fundamental frequency omega zero rather than on the fourier series coefficient number k , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,287,0,0,2906.750,6,7,signalprocessing,whereas in continuous time for the fourier transform we had a duality between the time domain and frequency domain , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,295,0,0,2970.290,3,4,signalprocessing,again on the fourier transform the discrete time fourier transform develop or illuminate some of the properties of the fourier transform and then see how these properties can be used for a number of things , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,4,0,0,55.260,10,11,signalprocessing,last time we began the development of the discrete time fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,68.710,4,5,signalprocessing,this led to the fourier series , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,7,0,0,71.060,7,8,signalprocessing,and then we generalized that to the fourier transform and finally incorporated within the framework of the fourier transform both aperiodic and periodic signals , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,0,0,83.070,17,18,signalprocessing,in today's lecture what i'd like to do is expand on some of the properties of the fourier transform and indicate how those properties are used for a variety of things , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,0,0,94.770,6,7,signalprocessing,well let's begin by reviewing the fourier transform as we developed it last time , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,107.040,13,14,signalprocessing,the synthesis equation expressing x of n the sequence in terms of the fourier transform and the analysis equation telling us how to obtain the fourier transform from the original sequence , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,12,0,0,122.890,36,37,signalprocessing,and i draw your attention again to the basic point that the synthesis equation essentially corresponds to decomposing the sequence as a linear combination of complex exponentials with amplitudes that are in effect proportional to the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,13,0,0,145.820,4,5,signalprocessing,now the discrete time fourier transform just as the continuous time fourier transform has a number of important and useful properties , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,16,0,0,180.540,7,8,signalprocessing,also as i indicated last time the fourier transform is a periodic function of frequency and the periodicity is with a period of two pi , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,17,0,0,196.030,8,9,signalprocessing,and so it says in effect that the fourier transform if we replace the frequency variable by an integer multiple of two pi the function repeats , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,20,0,0,236.780,6,7,signalprocessing,just as in continuous time the fourier transform has important symmetry properties , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,21,0,0,243.560,14,15,signalprocessing,and in particular if the sequence x sub n is real valued then the fourier transform is conjugate symmetric , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,22,0,0,254.680,18,19,signalprocessing,in other words if we replace omega by minus omega that's equivalent to applying complex conjugation to the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,26,0,0,306.730,4,5,signalprocessing,and that is the fourier transform of a real damped exponential , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,28,0,0,323.590,6,7,signalprocessing,we saw last time that the fourier transform for this sequence algebraically is of this form , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,38,0,0,382.630,7,8,signalprocessing,we have this inherent periodicity in the fourier transform which i'm stressing very heavily because it forms the basic difference between continuous time and discrete time , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,39,0,0,396.170,7,8,signalprocessing,in addition to these properties of the fourier transform there are a number of other properties that are particularly useful in the manipulation of the fourier transform and in fact in using the fourier transform to for example analyze systems represented by linear constant coefficient difference equations , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,42,0,0,433.210,14,15,signalprocessing,and the time shifting property tells us that if x of omega is the fourier transform of x of n then the fourier transform of x of n shifted in time is that same fourier transform multiplied by this factor which is a linear phase factor , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,46,0,0,493.030,19,20,signalprocessing,and we'll see this frequency shifting property surface in a slightly different way shortly when we talk about the modulation property in the discrete time case , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,47,0,0,504.840,22,23,signalprocessing,another important property that we'll want to make use of shortly is linearity which follows in a very straightforward way from the fourier transform definition , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,48,0,0,516.860,8,9,signalprocessing,and the linearity property says simply that the fourier transform of a sum or linear combination is the same linear combination of the fourier transforms , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,50,0,0,532.750,38,39,signalprocessing,and also among other properties there is a parseval's relation for the discrete time case that in effect says something similar to continuous time specifically that the energy in the sequence is proportional to the energy in the fourier transform the energy over one period , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,51,0,0,557.370,30,31,signalprocessing,or said another way in fact or another way that it can be said is that the energy in the time domain is proportional to the power in this periodic fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,54,0,0,580.140,24,25,signalprocessing,two additional properties that will play important roles in discrete time just as they did in continuous time are the convolution property and the modulation property , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,55,0,0,593.730,13,14,signalprocessing,the convolution property is the property that tells us how to relate the fourier transform of the convolution of two sequences to the fourier transforms of the individual sequences , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,56,0,0,608.940,14,15,signalprocessing,and not surprisingly what happens and this can be demonstrated algebraically not surprisingly the fourier transform of the convolution is simply the product of the fourier transforms , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,57,0,0,624.960,1,2,signalprocessing,so fourier transform maps convolution in the time domain to multiplication in the frequency domain , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,60,0,0,647.710,12,13,signalprocessing,the convolution property then tells us that in the frequency domain the fourier transform is the product of the fourier transform of the impulse response and the fourier transform of the input , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,61,0,0,665.120,12,13,signalprocessing,now we also saw and have talked about a relationship between the fourier transform the impulse response and what we call the frequency response in the context of the response of a system to a complex exponential , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,64,0,0,705.920,21,22,signalprocessing,and as you saw in the video course manual this eigenvalue this constant multiplier on the exponential is in fact the fourier transform of the impulse response evaluated at that frequency , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,67,0,0,733.280,6,7,signalprocessing,the frequency response interpretation of the fourier transform the impulse response we use that to motivate an intuitive interpretation of the convolution property , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,68,0,0,746.550,15,16,signalprocessing,now formally the convolution property can be developed by taking the convolution sum applying the fourier transform sum to it doing the appropriate substitution of variables interchanging order of summations et cetera and all the algebra works out to show that it's a product , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,71,0,0,783.330,6,7,signalprocessing,specifically the argument was that the fourier transform of a sequence or signal corresponds to decomposing it into a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,73,0,0,801.310,5,6,signalprocessing,it's basically proportional to the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,74,0,0,805.990,25,26,signalprocessing,if we think of pushing through the system that linear combination then each of those complex exponentials gets the amplitude modified or multiplied by the fourier transform of by the frequency response which we saw is the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,76,0,0,841.470,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier transform of the output in effect is an expression expressing the summation or integration of the output as a linear combination of all of these exponentials with the appropriate complex amplitudes , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,77,0,0,859.580,7,8,signalprocessing,so it's important in thinking about the convolution property to think about it in terms of nothing more than the fact that we've decomposed the input and we're now modifying separately through multiplication through scaling the amplitudes of each of the complex exponential components , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,78,0,0,887.230,13,14,signalprocessing,now what we saw in continuous time is that this interpretation and the convolution property led to an important concept namely the concept of filtering , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,102,0,0,1103.620,5,6,signalprocessing,ok so we've seen the convolution property and its interpretation in terms of filtering , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,103,0,0,1111.760,3,4,signalprocessing,more broadly the convolution property in combination with a number of the other properties that i introduced in particular the time shifting and linearity property allows us to generate or analyze systems that are described by linear constant coefficient difference equations , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,111,0,0,1191.140,14,15,signalprocessing,let's now consider generating the solution by taking advantage of the properties of the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,112,0,0,1199.270,13,14,signalprocessing,well just as we did in continuous time we can consider applying the fourier transform to both sides of this equation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,113,0,0,1207.210,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier transform of y of n of course is y of omega , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,114,0,0,1212.680,11,12,signalprocessing,and then using the shifting property the time shifting property the fourier transform of y of n minus one is y of omega multiplied by e to the minus j omega , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,116,0,0,1234.290,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier transform of x of n is x of omega , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,117,0,0,1239.020,8,9,signalprocessing,well we can solve this equation for the fourier transform of the output in terms of the fourier transform of the input and an appropriate complex scale factor , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,120,0,0,1275.860,9,10,signalprocessing,at this point we can recognize that here the fourier transform of the output is the product of the fourier transform of the input and some complex function , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,121,0,0,1288.860,20,21,signalprocessing,and from the convolution property then that complex function must in fact correspond to the frequency response or equivalently the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,122,0,0,1305.620,7,8,signalprocessing,so if we want to determine the fourier transform of the or the impulse response of the system let's say for example then it becomes a matter of having identified the fourier transform of the impulse response which is the frequency response , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,125,0,0,1330.730,16,17,signalprocessing,of course we could do it by attempting to go through the synthesis equation for the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,127,0,0,1345.362,18,19,signalprocessing,and in particular we know that from an example that we worked before this is in fact the fourier transform of a sequence which is a to the n times u of n , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,172,0,0,1817.200,25,26,signalprocessing,now in addition to the convolution property another important property that we had in continuous time and that we have in discrete time is the modulation property , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,173,0,0,1831.500,1,2,signalprocessing,the modulation property tells us what happens in the frequency domain when you multiply signals in the time domain , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,174,0,0,1841.700,4,5,signalprocessing,in continuous time the modulation property corresponded to the statement that if we multiply the time domain we convolve the fourier transforms in the frequency domain , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,178,0,0,1901.050,5,6,signalprocessing,so again we have a convolution property in discrete time that is very much like the convolution property in continuous time , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,181,0,0,1928.570,10,11,signalprocessing,well let's take a look at an example of the modulation property which will then lead to one particular application and a very useful application of the modulation property in discrete time , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,185,0,0,1983.200,15,16,signalprocessing,in applying the modulation property of course what we need to do is develop the fourier transform of this signal , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,189,0,0,2008.700,6,7,signalprocessing,and recall that to get the fourier transform of a periodic signal one way to do it is to generate the fourier series coefficients for the periodic signal and then identify the fourier transform as an impulse train where the heights of the impulses in the impulse train are proportional with a proportionality factor of two pi proportional to the fourier series coefficients , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,190,0,0,2038.200,7,8,signalprocessing,so let's first work out what the fourier series is and for this example in fact it's fairly easy , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,191,0,0,2044.580,8,9,signalprocessing,here is the general synthesis equation for the fourier series , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,198,0,0,2119.760,9,10,signalprocessing,so we've done it simply by essentially inspecting the fourier series synthesis equation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,199,0,0,2130.950,8,9,signalprocessing,ok now if we want to get the fourier transform for this we take those coefficients and essentially generate an impulse train where we choose as values for the impulses two pi times the fourier series coefficients , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,200,0,0,2150.680,2,3,signalprocessing,so the fourier series coefficients are a zero is equal to zero and a one is equal to one , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,201,0,0,2156.630,12,13,signalprocessing,so notice that in the plot that i've shown here of the fourier transform of x one of n we have the zero th coefficient , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,206,0,0,2201.150,3,4,signalprocessing,corresponds to the fourier series coefficient a sub minus one , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,207,0,0,2205.560,26,27,signalprocessing,and of course if we drew this out over a longer frequency axis we would see lots of other impulses because of the fact that the fourier transform periodically repeats or equivalently the fourier series coefficients periodically repeat , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,213,0,0,2259.800,11,12,signalprocessing,let's consider a signal x two of n which has a fourier transform as i've indicated here , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,214,0,0,2267.300,2,3,signalprocessing,then the fourier transform of the product of x one of n and x two of n is the convolution of these two spectra , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,218,0,0,2316.180,8,9,signalprocessing,and so this spectrum finally corresponds to the fourier transform of minus one to the n times x two of n where x two of n is the sequence whose spectrum was x two of omega , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,225,0,0,2376.730,19,20,signalprocessing,let me draw your attention to the fact that when a is positive we have this sequence and its fourier transform is as i show on the right , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,227,0,0,2403.030,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier transform of that you can now see and verify also algebraically if you'd like is identical to this spectrum simply shifted by pi , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,230,0,0,2438.250,10,11,signalprocessing,and we can interpret that in the context of the modulation property , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,236,0,0,2524.650,18,19,signalprocessing,since this ideal highpass filter is this ideal lowpass filter with the frequency response shifted by pi the modulation property tells us that in the time domain what that corresponds to is an impulse response multiplied by minus one to the n , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,237,0,0,2546.950,15,16,signalprocessing,so it says that the impulse response of the highpass filter or equivalently the inverse fourier transform of the highpass filter frequency response is minus one to the n times the impulse response for the lowpass filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,238,0,0,2563.780,5,6,signalprocessing,that all follows from the modulation property , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,241,0,0,2580.710,1,2,signalprocessing,the modulation property tells us about multiplying the time domain is shifting in the frequency domain , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,258,0,0,2748.930,12,13,signalprocessing,well let's begin this summary by first looking at the continuous time fourier series , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,259,0,0,2757.240,4,5,signalprocessing,in the continuous time fourier series we have a periodic time function expanded as a linear combination of harmonically related complex exponentials , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,261,0,0,2775.710,13,14,signalprocessing,and we saw an analysis equation which tells us how to get these fourier series coefficients through an integration on the original time function , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,263,0,0,2794.250,13,14,signalprocessing,what we end up with in the frequency domain is a sequence of fourier series coefficients which in fact is an infinite sequence namely requires all values of k in general , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,264,0,0,2809.380,9,10,signalprocessing,we had then generalized that to the continuous time fourier transform and in effect in doing that what happened is that the synthesis equation in the fourier series became an integral relationship in the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,269,0,0,2895.110,6,7,signalprocessing,we began with the discrete time fourier series , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,273,0,0,2929.640,8,9,signalprocessing,and we ended up with a set of fourier series coefficients , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,274,0,0,2933.270,6,7,signalprocessing,which of course are discrete as fourier series coefficients are and which periodically repeat because of the fact that the associated complex exponentials periodically repeat , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,277,0,0,2987.190,9,10,signalprocessing,and this term x of omega which is the fourier transform is given by this summation and of course involves all of the values of x of n , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,284,0,0,3044.230,17,18,signalprocessing,and so in fact if we make reference to duality there isn't duality in the continuous time fourier series , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,285,0,0,3055.900,5,6,signalprocessing,however for the continuous time fourier transform we're talking about aperiodic time functions and aperiodic frequency functions , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,287,0,0,3071.550,9,10,signalprocessing,in other words the time function effectively is the fourier transform of the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,289,0,0,3081.780,16,17,signalprocessing,and in fact we had exploited that duality property when we talked about the continuous time fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,290,0,0,3092.020,4,5,signalprocessing,with the discrete time fourier series we have a duality indicated by the fact that we have a periodic time function and a sequence which is periodic in the frequency domain , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,292,0,0,3115.200,6,7,signalprocessing,and so it's the discrete time fourier series that has a duality , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,293,0,0,3122.630,5,6,signalprocessing,and finally the discrete time fourier transform loses the duality because of the fact among other things that in the time domain things are inherently discrete whereas in the frequency domain they're inherently continuous , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,297,0,0,3159.610,12,13,signalprocessing,and we can see that first algebraically by comparing the continuous time fourier series and the discrete time fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,298,0,0,3174.240,3,4,signalprocessing,the continuous time fourier series in the time domain is a periodic continuous function in the frequency domain is an aperiodic sequence , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,302,0,0,3214.990,25,26,signalprocessing,and in fact if you look at the relationship between these two then what we see in fact is a duality between the continuous time fourier series and the discrete time fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,303,0,0,3236.500,32,33,signalprocessing,one way of thinking of that is to kind of think and this is a little bit of a tongue twister which you might want to get straightened out slowly but the fourier transform in discrete time is a periodic function of frequency , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,304,0,0,3252.270,5,6,signalprocessing,that periodic function has a fourier series representation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,305,0,0,3257.190,3,4,signalprocessing,what is this fourier series , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,306,0,0,3259.540,3,4,signalprocessing,what are the fourier series coefficients of that periodic function , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,307,0,0,3262.730,20,21,signalprocessing,well in fact except for an issue of time reversal what it is the original sequence for which that's the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,311,0,0,3295.000,6,7,signalprocessing,also as we've talked about the fourier transform both continuous time and discrete time two important properties that we focused on among many of the properties are the convolution property and the modulation property , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,312,0,0,3309.950,5,6,signalprocessing,we've also shown that the convolution property leads to a very important concept namely filtering , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,313,0,0,3319.020,1,2,signalprocessing,the modulation property leads to an important concept namely modulation , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,4,0,0,64.050,12,13,signalprocessing,two particularly significant ones as i mentioned at the time are the modulation property and the convolution property , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,5,0,0,72.860,21,22,signalprocessing,starting with the next lecture the one after this one we'll be developing and exploiting some of the consequences of the modulation property , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,82.260,27,28,signalprocessing,in today's lecture though i'd like to review and expand on the notion of filtering which as i had mentioned flows more or less directly from the convolution property , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,7,0,0,96.700,9,10,signalprocessing,to begin let me just quickly review what the convolution property is , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,0,0,101.260,15,16,signalprocessing,both for continuous time and for discrete time the convolution property tells us that the fourier transform of the convolution of two time functions is the product of the fourier transforms , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,0,0,119.190,47,48,signalprocessing,now what this means in terms of linear time invariant filters since we know that in the time domain the output of a linear time invariant filter is the convolution of the input and the impulse response it says essentially then in the frequency domain that the fourier transform of the output is the product the fourier transform of the impulse response namely the frequency response and the fourier transform of the input , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,156.370,7,8,signalprocessing,now recall also that in developing the fourier transform i interpreted the fourier transform as the complex amplitude of a decomposition of the signal in terms of a set of complex exponentials , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,12,0,0,172.120,6,7,signalprocessing,and the frequency response or the convolution property in effect tells us how to modify the amplitudes of each of those complex exponentials as they go through the system , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,47,0,0,454.760,10,11,signalprocessing,that means as a consequence of the properties of the fourier transform and inverse fourier transform that the impulse response is an even function in the time domain , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,91,0,0,891.480,34,35,signalprocessing,now we can write the differential equation for either of these systems and as we talked about last time in the last several lectures solve that equation using and exploiting the properties of the fourier transform , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,93,0,0,921.740,9,10,signalprocessing,and so just working our way down applying the fourier transform to the differential equation and generating the system function by taking the ratio of the capacitor voltage or its fourier transform to the fourier transform of the source we then have the system function associated with the system for which the output is the capacitor voltage , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,209,0,0,1859.870,5,6,signalprocessing,we've looked previously at the fourier transform of this rectangular sequence , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,210,0,0,1864.240,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier transform of that in fact is of the form of a sine n x over sine x curve , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,253,0,0,2257.540,23,24,signalprocessing,and so interpreting the first order difference equation as a system what we're attempting to generate is the frequency response which is the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,254,0,0,2272.760,23,24,signalprocessing,and from the difference equation we can of course solve for either one of those by using the properties exploiting the properties of fourier transform , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,255,0,0,2283.770,2,3,signalprocessing,applying the fourier transform to the difference equation we will end up with the fourier transform of the output equal to the fourier transform of the input times this factor which we know from the convolution property in fact is the frequency response of the system , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,257,0,0,2307.440,5,6,signalprocessing,and of course the inverse fourier transform of that which i indicate below is the system impulse response , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,258,0,0,2317.910,10,11,signalprocessing,so we have the frequency response obtained by applying the fourier transform to the difference equation the impulse response , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,23,0,0,294.670,28,29,signalprocessing,and what we'll see in particular as we go through today's lecture is that sinusoidal amplitude modulation follows in a fairly straightforward way from the properties of the fourier transform that we've developed in some of the earlier lectures , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,26,0,0,336.040,16,17,signalprocessing,and all of these follow in a very straightforward way from the modulation property for the fourier transform , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,34,0,0,401.640,19,20,signalprocessing,now to analyze this since we have multiplication in the time domain we know from the property of the fourier transform that we've developed previously the modulation property that multiplication in the time domain corresponds to convolution in the frequency domain , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,49,0,0,535.870,9,10,signalprocessing,well we can do that by concentrating on the modulation property , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,51,0,0,546.820,6,7,signalprocessing,what i've indicated here for the fourier transform of the input signal or modulating signal x of omega , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,53,0,0,565.760,13,14,signalprocessing,and then the carrier signal since it's a single complex exponential has a fourier transform which is an impulse in the frequency domain , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,153,0,0,1431.460,7,8,signalprocessing,and so now when we apply the modulation property we have the original spectrum which i show here x of omega , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,160,0,0,1475.340,7,8,signalprocessing,and so now when we apply the modulation property what we will do is convolve this spectrum with this spectrum and the result is that the spectrum of the original signal gets replicated at both omega sub c and at minus omega sub c , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,351,0,0,3167.180,15,16,signalprocessing,so from what might have seemed like a fairly abstract mathematical property associated with the fourier transform we've begun to develop what should give you the sense of some important practical considerations , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,40,1,0,240.510,34,35,signalprocessing,and actually as you realize from the previous lectures with the triangle and square wave with the same fundamental as the sine wave the richness comes in because of the higher harmonics in the fourier series representation , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,106,1,0,613.770,3,4,signalprocessing,it computes the fourier transform or the spectrum , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,110,1,0,649.410,24,25,signalprocessing,it's filtered and sampled and captured on a block basis put into a digital memory and then a digital computer or microprocessor computes the fourier transform , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,111,1,0,662.250,3,4,signalprocessing,and then that fourier transform is what we see on the display , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,112,1,0,666.930,10,11,signalprocessing,so what we're computing of course are samples of the fourier transform , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,114,1,0,676.040,5,6,signalprocessing,was a rectangular pulse whose fourier transform is of the form of a sine x over x function what we would in fact see on the display are samples of that at discrete frequencies , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,115,1,0,689.900,21,22,signalprocessing,or if as we have an input which is a square wave what will generate through the spectrum analyzer are the fourier series coefficients or equivalently the harmonics associated with the square wave , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,130,1,0,800.320,27,28,signalprocessing,and then the amplitude of the square wave decays proportional to one over f which is the kind of analysis that we've gone through in looking at fourier series , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,14,0,0,176.170,12,13,signalprocessing,and it was in continuous time the modulation property associated with the fourier transform that provided the basis for the analysis , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,16,0,0,192.120,17,18,signalprocessing,in particular what we have in discrete time is the modulation property as it relates to the fourier transform which tells us that the fourier transform of the modulated signal is the convolution of the fourier transform of the carrier and the fourier transform of the modulated signal , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,24,0,0,286.170,6,7,signalprocessing,well we have once again the modulation property , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,25,0,0,290.740,2,3,signalprocessing,and the modulation property tells us that the spectrum of the modulated signal is the periodic convolution of the two spectra , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,76,0,0,1014.580,10,11,signalprocessing,we had originally talked about this when we introduce the modulation property in the context of converting a low pass filter to a high pass filter , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,80,0,0,1096.590,18,19,signalprocessing,and as i've represented it here and as we had talked about it when we talked about the modulation property for discrete time signals we had specifically chosen the conversion of a low pass to a high pass filter , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,112,0,0,1478.860,14,15,signalprocessing,basically a square wave and as we've seen in previous lectures the spectra or fourier transform associated with that is an impulse train , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,114,0,0,1497.430,1,2,signalprocessing,the fourier transform is impulses , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,121,0,0,1537.780,8,9,signalprocessing,so in the frequency domain we have the fourier transform of the time function convolved with this fourier transform for the pulse train , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,123,0,0,1548.550,8,9,signalprocessing,if we were to consider let's say a fourier transform , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,5,1,0,59.960,50,51,signalprocessing,and just as a quick reminder the sampling theorem said that if we have a continuous time signal and we have equally spaced samples of that signal sampled at a sampling period which i indicate is capital t and if x of t is band limited in other words the fourier transform is zero outside some band where omega sub m is the highest frequency then under the condition that the sampling frequency which is two pi divided by the period is greater than twice the highest frequency , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,1,0,123.830,18,19,signalprocessing,and the sampling theorem developed by examining the consequence of the modulation property in the context of the fourier transform , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,1,0,133.940,70,71,signalprocessing,in particular if we have our signal x of t and if multiplied by an impulse train to give us a sampled signal another impulse train whose values or areas are samples of the original time function as i indicate here then in fact if we examine this equation or equivalently bringing x of t inside this sum if we examine either of these equations in the frequency domain the fourier transform of x of p of t is the convolution of the fourier transform of the original signal and the fourier transform of the impulse train , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,1,0,187.110,1,2,signalprocessing,it's fourier transform , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,13,1,0,193.880,12,13,signalprocessing,and when we do this convolution then using the fact that the fourier transform the impulse train is an impulse train , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,14,1,0,203.480,10,11,signalprocessing,the result of this convolution then tells us that the fourier transform of the sample signal or the impulse train which represents the samples is a sum of frequency shifted replications of the fourier transform of the original signal , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,18,1,0,249.280,72,73,signalprocessing,and again to remind you of the basic picture involved if we have an original signal with a spectrum as i indicated here where it's band limited with the highest frequency omega sub m and if the time function is sampled so that in the frequency domain we convolve this spectrum with the spectrum shown below which is the spectrum of the impulse train the convolution of these two is then the fourier transform or spectrum of the sample time function , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,23,1,0,345.990,1,2,signalprocessing,the fourier transform i show here of the original signal and after modulation with the impulse train the resulting spectrum that we have is that replicated around integer multiples of the sampling frequency , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,34,1,0,479.710,26,27,signalprocessing,if in fact the sampling frequency is not high enough to avoid aliasing then what happens in that case is that the individual replications of the fourier transform of the original signal overlap and what we end up with is some distortion , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,48,1,0,607.490,4,5,signalprocessing,and the spectrum or fourier transform of that is an impulse in the frequency domain at the frequency of the sinusoid , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,68,1,0,823.840,2,3,signalprocessing,and its fourier transform is an impulse in the frequency domain as we've indicated , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,70,1,0,835.670,9,10,signalprocessing,and so its samples in particular will have a fourier transform not only with an impulse at the input sinusoidal frequency but also at ten kilohertz minus that frequency , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,87,1,0,998.480,5,6,signalprocessing,the bottom trace is the fourier transform of the sampled waveform , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,171,0,0,1553.670,35,36,signalprocessing,well instead of the zero order hold if we used the first order hold corresponding to the triangular impulse response in that case then in the frequency domain the associated frequency response would be the fourier transform of the triangle , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,172,0,0,1569.090,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier transform of a triangle is a sine squared x over x squared kind of function , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,251,0,0,2311.670,40,41,signalprocessing,so what i'd like to do as a first step in understanding this process is to analyze it in particular with our attention focused on trying to understand what the relationship is in the frequency domain between the discrete time fourier transform of the sequence discrete time signal and the continuous time fourier transform of the original unsampled and then the sampled signal , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,261,0,0,2403.080,11,12,signalprocessing,so in the frequency domain we have a convolution of the fourier transform of the continuous time signal the original signal and the fourier transform of the impulse train which is itself an impulse train , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,262,0,0,2418.590,7,8,signalprocessing,so in the frequency domain then the fourier transform of the sampled signal which is an impulse train is the convolution of the fourier transform of the sampling function p of t and the fourier transform of the sampled signal , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,263,0,0,2436.440,10,11,signalprocessing,since the sampling signal is a periodic impulse train its fourier transform is an impulse train , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,264,0,0,2444.750,11,12,signalprocessing,and consequently carrying out this convolution in effect says that this fourier transform simply gets replicated at each of the locations of these impulses , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,265,0,0,2457.600,10,11,signalprocessing,and finally what we end up with then is a fourier transform after the sampling process which is the original fourier transform of the continuous signal but added to itself shifted by integer multiples of the sampling frequency , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,274,0,0,2533.840,10,11,signalprocessing,and what we want to relate is the discrete time fourier transform of this and the continuous time fourier transform of this or in fact the continuous time fourier transform of x of c of t , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,276,0,0,2554.930,2,3,signalprocessing,and it's fourier transform we can get by simply evaluating the fourier transform , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,277,0,0,2562.000,3,4,signalprocessing,and since the fourier transform of this since this corresponds to an impulse train the fourier transform by the time we change some sums and integrals will then have this impulse replaced by the fourier transform of the shifted impulse which is this exponential factor , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,278,0,0,2581.570,5,6,signalprocessing,so this expression is the fourier transform of the impulse train the continuous time fourier transform , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,279,0,0,2588.850,7,8,signalprocessing,and alternatively we can look at the fourier transform of the sequence , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,280,0,0,2595.080,8,9,signalprocessing,and this of course is a discrete time fourier transform , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,281,0,0,2601.110,6,7,signalprocessing,so we have the continuous time fourier transform of the impulse train we have the discrete fourier transform of the sequence , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,288,0,0,2669.970,14,15,signalprocessing,and so in fact the relationship that we have is that the discrete time fourier transform of the sequence of samples is equal to the continuous time fourier transform of the impulse train of samples where we associate the continuous time frequency variable and the discrete time frequency variable through a frequency scaling as i indicate here , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,292,0,0,2726.130,9,10,signalprocessing,in the frequency domain that corresponds to replicating the fourier transform of the original continuous time signal , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,310,0,0,2888.470,9,10,signalprocessing,in the frequency domain what we have is the fourier transform of our original continuous signal , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,60,0,0,739.790,23,24,signalprocessing,and so now the spectrum of y of n the output of the digital filter is the product of this spectrum and the fourier transform or frequency response of the digital filter , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,26,0,0,299.680,4,5,signalprocessing,as we know the fourier transform of an impulse train is itself an impulse train , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,27,0,0,305.560,5,6,signalprocessing,and so this is the fourier transform of the sampling sequence , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,28,0,0,311.990,4,5,signalprocessing,and now finally the fourier transform of the resulting sample sequence being the convolution of this with the fourier transform of the sequence that we're sampling , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,29,0,0,326.300,15,16,signalprocessing,gives us then a spectrum which consists of a sum of replicated versions of the fourier transform of the sequence that we're sampling , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,38,0,0,420.460,3,4,signalprocessing,this is its fourier transform with an assumed highest frequency omega sub m highest frequency over a two pi range or over a range of pi rather , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,45,0,0,489.740,34,35,signalprocessing,now when we look at this what we recognize is that we have basically the same issue here as we had in continuous time in the sense that when these individual replications of the fourier transform when the sampling frequency is chosen high enough so that they don't overlap then we see the potential for being able to get one of them back , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,50,0,0,567.160,9,10,signalprocessing,and in this picture the individual replications of the fourier transform of the original signal overlap , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,51,0,0,576.700,7,8,signalprocessing,and we can no longer recover the fourier transform of the original signal , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,54,0,0,598.680,9,10,signalprocessing,so in that case what we have is a fourier transform for the sampled signal which is as i indicated here and the fourier transform for the original signal as i indicate at the top , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,104,0,0,1082.870,10,11,signalprocessing,in particular what we want to develop is how the fourier transform of the decimated sequence is related to the fourier transform of the original sequence or the sample sequence , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,114,0,0,1170.990,7,8,signalprocessing,and we know of course that the fourier transform of the sample sequence is just simply this summation , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,119,0,0,1220.080,5,6,signalprocessing,so this then is the fourier transform all of the sampled signal , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,120,0,0,1225.590,7,8,signalprocessing,and now if we look at the fourier transform of the decimated signal that fourier transform of course is this summation on the decimated sequence , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,125,0,0,1276.740,20,21,signalprocessing,so the consequence of that then what it all boils down to and says is that the relationship between the fourier transform of the decimated sequence and the fourier transform of the sampled sequence is simply a frequency scaling corresponding to dividing the frequency axis by capital n , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,130,0,0,1324.470,9,10,signalprocessing,and in the frequency domain we have again the fourier transform of the original sequence and we have the fourier transform of the sampled sequence , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,131,0,0,1343.350,3,4,signalprocessing,and now the fourier transform of the decimated sequence is simply this spectrum with a linear frequency scaling , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,154,0,0,1566.490,15,16,signalprocessing,and so the result of that the product of the filter frequency response and the fourier transform of x of n would have a shape somewhat like i indicate below , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,244,0,0,2432.370,14,15,signalprocessing,suppose that you have a signal and what you'd like to measure is its fourier transform its spectrum , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,247,0,0,2452.280,14,15,signalprocessing,and so in fact all that you can really calculate or measure is the fourier transform at a set of sample frequencies , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,250,0,0,2471.060,26,27,signalprocessing,and a reasonable question to ask then is when does a set of samples in fact tell you everything that there is to know about the fourier transform , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,253,0,0,2511.160,6,7,signalprocessing,and so we would multiply the fourier transform of the signal whose spectrum is to be sampled by an impulse train in frequency , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,256,0,0,2547.670,3,4,signalprocessing,or correspondingly the fourier transform of the resulting signal is an impulse train in frequency with an envelope which is the original spectrum that we were sampling , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,267,0,0,2611.340,23,24,signalprocessing,so in fact if we look at this in the time domain the resulting picture corresponds to an original signal whose spectrum or fourier transform we've sampled , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,271,0,0,2669.660,10,11,signalprocessing,we know that an impulse train in frequency is the fourier transform of a periodic time function , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,274,0,0,2683.240,10,11,signalprocessing,we know this from way back when we talked about fourier transforms the envelope in fact is the fourier transform of one period , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,276,0,0,2696.620,10,11,signalprocessing,now given that we have this periodic time function whose fourier transform is the samples in the frequency domain how do we get back the original time function , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,284,0,0,2804.820,22,23,signalprocessing,namely if we have a discrete time signal and if the discrete time signal is a finite length if we sample its fourier transform the time function associated with those samples is a periodic replication , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,296,0,0,2926.740,10,11,signalprocessing,and what those will correspond to are generalizations of the fourier transform , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,297,0,0,2932.930,20,21,signalprocessing,so we now want to turn our attention back to some analytical tools in particular developing some generalizations of the fourier transform in both continuous time and discrete time , Lecture1IntroductionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,150,0,0,1597.630,23,24,signalprocessing,and in the context of the frequency domain representation some of the kinds of ideas and topics that we'll be exploring are the fourier transform and the laplace transform and a discrete time counterpart of the laplace transform which is the z transform , Lecture1IntroductionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,151,0,0,1619.140,1,2,signalprocessing,the fourier transform discussion we'll get into fairly early in the course , Lecture1IntroductionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,152,0,0,1623.990,11,12,signalprocessing,and the laplace transform and z transform represent extensions of the fourier transform and we'll be getting into that later in the course , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,4,0,0,56.170,19,20,signalprocessing,over the last series of lectures in discussing filtering modulation and sampling we've seen how powerful and useful the fourier transform is , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,5,0,0,66.490,20,21,signalprocessing,beginning with this lecture and over the next several lectures i'd like to develop and exploit a generalization of the fourier transform which will not only lead to some important new insights about signals and systems but also will remove some of the restrictions that we've had with the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,125.080,20,21,signalprocessing,now to introduce the notion of the laplace transform let me remind you again of what led us into the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,135.380,3,4,signalprocessing,we developed the fourier transform by considering the idea of representing signals as linear combinations of basic signals , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,12,0,0,147.660,3,4,signalprocessing,and in the fourier transform in the continuous time case , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,19,0,0,227.100,18,19,signalprocessing,and this change in amplitude in fact corresponded as we showed as the discussion went along to the fourier transform of the system impulse response , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,20,0,0,240.380,15,16,signalprocessing,so the notion of decomposing signals into complex exponentials was very intimately connected and the fourier transform was very intimately connected with the eigenfunction property of complex exponentials for linear time invariant systems , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,41,0,0,459.990,16,17,signalprocessing,it's denoted as x of s and as a shorthand notation as we had with the fourier transform then we have in the time domain the time function x of t and in the laplace transform domain the function x of s , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,43,0,0,481.560,30,31,signalprocessing,now let me remind you that the development of that mapping is exactly the process the we went through initially in developing a mapping that ended up giving us the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,46,0,0,519.080,22,23,signalprocessing,well the discussion that we've gone through so far of course is very closely related to what we went through for the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,48,0,0,531.850,23,24,signalprocessing,and as you can well imagine and perhaps may have recognized already there's a very close connection between the laplace transform and the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,49,0,0,543.500,18,19,signalprocessing,well to see one of the connections what we can observe is that if we look at the fourier transform expression and if we look at the laplace transform expression where s is now a general complex number sigma plus j omega these two expressions in fact are identical if in fact sigma is equal to zero , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,52,0,0,587.530,33,34,signalprocessing,what this then tells us is that if we have the laplace transform and if we look at the laplace transform at s equals j omega then that in fact corresponds to the fourier transform of x of t , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,58,0,0,644.140,13,14,signalprocessing,on the other hand the right hand side of the equation namely the fourier transform of x of t we've typically written as x of omega , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,61,0,0,667.920,17,18,signalprocessing,and a very straightforward way of dealing with that is to simply change our notation for the fourier transform recognizing that the fourier transform of course is a function of omega but it's also in fact a function of j omega , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,63,0,0,689.440,20,21,signalprocessing,in other words the laplace transform at s equals j omega just simply reduces both mathematically and notationally to the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,64,0,0,699.100,10,11,signalprocessing,so the notation that we'll now be adopting for the fourier transform is the notation whereby we express the fourier transform no longer simply as x of omega but choosing as the argument j omega , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,66,0,0,719.620,8,9,signalprocessing,now here we see one relationship between the fourier transform and the laplace transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,67,0,0,726.560,13,14,signalprocessing,namely that the laplace transform for s equals j omega reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,69,0,0,737.340,13,14,signalprocessing,in particular the fact that the laplace transform can be interpreted as the fourier transform of a modified version of x of t , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,73,0,0,758.225,6,7,signalprocessing,the laplace transform reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,78,0,0,800.140,17,18,signalprocessing,and now when we look at this what we observe is that this in fact is the fourier transform of something , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,80,0,0,812.160,8,9,signalprocessing,it's not x of t anymore it's the fourier transform of x of t multiplied by e to the minus sigma t , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,81,0,0,820.730,14,15,signalprocessing,so if we think of these two terms together this integral is just the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,82,0,0,826.930,2,3,signalprocessing,it's the fourier transform of x of t multiplied by an exponential , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,85,0,0,845.380,16,17,signalprocessing,so we have then this additional relationship which tells us that the laplace transform is the fourier transform of an exponentially weighted time function , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,87,0,0,866.000,11,12,signalprocessing,in particular recall that there were issues of convergence with the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,88,0,0,871.840,3,4,signalprocessing,in particular the fourier transform may or may not converge , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,93,0,0,917.190,13,14,signalprocessing,and so the conclusion an important point is that the laplace transform the fourier transform of this product may converge even though the fourier transform of x of t doesn't , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,94,0,0,929.530,11,12,signalprocessing,in other words the laplace transform may converge even when the fourier transform doesn't converge , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,98,0,0,963.100,7,8,signalprocessing,in effect we can apply the inverse fourier transform to this thereby to this account for the exponential factor by bringing it over to the other side , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,106,0,0,1046.329,4,5,signalprocessing,if we take the fourier transform of this exponential , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,110,0,0,1064.680,10,11,signalprocessing,what that really means is that for convergence of the fourier transform this has to be a decaying exponential , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,113,0,0,1081.620,10,11,signalprocessing,applying the laplace transform is the same as taking the fourier transform of x of t times an exponential and the exponent that we would multiply by is e to the minus sigma t , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,114,0,0,1095.710,13,14,signalprocessing,so in effect taking the laplace transform of this is like taking the fourier transform of e to the minus at e to the minus sigma t , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,116,0,0,1122.200,5,6,signalprocessing,but just as in the fourier transform the fourier transform won't converge for any a , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,117,0,0,1130.980,13,14,signalprocessing,now what happens is that the laplace transform will only converge when the fourier transform of this converges , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,123,0,0,1177.430,4,5,signalprocessing,so that essentially the fourier transform of x of t times e to the minus sigma t converges , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,127,0,0,1220.210,2,3,signalprocessing,with the fourier transform either it converged or it didn't converge , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,196,0,0,1809.450,24,25,signalprocessing,the reason for that is that s is sigma plus j omega and convergence of the laplace transform is associated with convergence of the fourier transform of e to the minus sigma t times x of t , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,203,0,0,1869.360,15,16,signalprocessing,now finally we can tie together the region of convergence to the convergence of the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,204,0,0,1877.980,12,13,signalprocessing,in particular since we know that the laplace transform reduces to the fourier transform when the complex variable s is equal to j omega the implication is that if we have the laplace transform and if the laplace transform reduces to the fourier transform when sigma equals zero , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,205,0,0,1904.440,12,13,signalprocessing,in other words when s is equal to j omega then the fourier transform of x of t converging is equivalent to the statement that the laplace transform converges for sigma equal to zero , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,236,0,0,2158.230,4,5,signalprocessing,now recall that the fourier transform converges if the time function has the property that it's absolutely integrable , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,238,0,0,2177.830,3,4,signalprocessing,now here the fourier transform will converge , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,240,0,0,2189.770,6,7,signalprocessing,well the laplace transform is the fourier transform of the time function multiplied by an exponential , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,292,0,0,2746.040,27,28,signalprocessing,well if we have a laplace transform we can in principle get the time function back again by recognizing this relationship between the laplace transform and the fourier transform and using the formal fourier transform expression , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,294,0,0,2767.190,14,15,signalprocessing,but more typically what we would do is what we've done also with the fourier transform which is to use simple laplace transform pairs together with the notion of the partial fraction expansion , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,338,0,0,3152.510,21,22,signalprocessing,and a couple of points to underscore again is the fact that the laplace transform is very closely associated with the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,339,0,0,3162.690,14,15,signalprocessing,and in fact the laplace transform for s equals j omega reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,340,0,0,3169.570,8,9,signalprocessing,but more generally the laplace transform is the fourier transform of x of t with an exponential weighting , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,342,0,0,3185.010,10,11,signalprocessing,there are other exponentials for which that product has a fourier transform that doesn't converge , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,347,0,0,3232.060,5,6,signalprocessing,now just as with the fourier transform the laplace transform has some very important properties , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,4,0,0,56.490,12,13,signalprocessing,last time we introduced the laplace transform as a generalization of the fourier transform and just as a reminder the laplace transform expression as we developed it is this integral very much similar to the fourier transform integral except with a more general complex variable , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,5,0,0,79.210,16,17,signalprocessing,and in fact we developed and talked about the relationship between the laplace transform and the fourier transform , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,86.260,18,19,signalprocessing,in particular the laplace transform with the laplace transform variable s purely imaginary in fact reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,7,0,0,98.970,17,18,signalprocessing,or more generally with the laplace transform variable as a complex number the laplace transform is the fourier transform of the corresponding time function with an exponential weighting , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,140.400,5,6,signalprocessing,now just as with the fourier transform there are a number of properties of the laplace transform that are extremely useful in describing and analyzing signals and systems , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,16,0,0,203.320,20,21,signalprocessing,and as you can see by just setting s equal to j omega in fact this reduces to the corresponding fourier transform property , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,17,0,0,212.740,15,16,signalprocessing,and a third property that we'll make frequent use of is referred to as the convolution property , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,18,0,0,220.390,5,6,signalprocessing,again a generalization of the convolution property for fourier transforms , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,19,0,0,225.700,2,3,signalprocessing,here the convolution property says that the laplace transform of the convolution of two time functions is the product of the associated laplace transforms , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,22,0,0,275.130,25,26,signalprocessing,now the convolution property leads to of course a very important and useful mechanism for dealing with linear time invariant systems very much as the fourier transform did , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,23,0,0,290.330,3,4,signalprocessing,in particular the convolution property tells us that if we have a linear time invariant system the output in the time domain is the convolution of the input and the impulse response , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,26,0,0,324.220,5,6,signalprocessing,in the case of the fourier transform the fourier transform the impulse response we refer to as the frequency response , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,31,0,0,385.390,12,13,signalprocessing,and that in fact is the same condition for convergence of the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,34,0,0,405.710,11,12,signalprocessing,which of course is where the laplace transform reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,56,0,0,590.620,4,5,signalprocessing,we know from the convolution property that this laplace transform is the system function times x of s , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,115,0,0,1129.720,7,8,signalprocessing,and that corresponds to looking at the fourier transform of the impulse response which is the laplace transform on the j omega axis , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,189,0,0,1972.060,5,6,signalprocessing,and of course from the convolution property the overall system function is the product of the individual system functions , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,4,0,0,56.890,14,15,signalprocessing,in the last several lectures we've talked about a generalization of the continuous time fourier transform and a very similar strategy also applies to discrete time and that's what we want to begin to deal with in today's lecture , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,5,0,0,72.750,10,11,signalprocessing,so what we want to talk about is generalizing the fourier transform and what this will lead to in discrete time is a notion referred to as the z transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,84.380,10,11,signalprocessing,now just as in continuous time in discrete time the fourier transform corresponded to a representation of a sequence as a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,12,0,0,133.820,22,23,signalprocessing,and the change in complex amplitude which corresponds to the frequency response in fact is what led to the definition of the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,13,0,0,145.640,5,6,signalprocessing,in particular it is the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,14,0,0,151.610,25,26,signalprocessing,well that set of notions is more or less identical to the way we motivated the laplace transform in the continuous time case in the fourier transform in the continuous time case , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,37,0,0,461.760,17,18,signalprocessing,that same argument is also the kind of argument that we use to lead us into the fourier transform originally , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,38,0,0,471.200,21,22,signalprocessing,and once again what you would expect is that the z transform has a very close and important relationship to the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,40,0,0,486.730,10,11,signalprocessing,identical to the relationship between the laplace transform and the fourier transform in continuous time , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,42,0,0,498.650,12,13,signalprocessing,first of all what we recognize is that if we compare the fourier transform expression for a sequence and the z transform expression for the same sequence that they involve essentially the same operations , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,44,0,0,536.900,20,21,signalprocessing,said another way the z transform when z is e to the j omega is going to reduce to the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,45,0,0,547.900,18,19,signalprocessing,so we have a relationship like the one again that we had between the laplace transform and the fourier transform in continuous time , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,46,0,0,556.710,20,21,signalprocessing,namely that for a certain set of values of the complex variable the transform the z transform reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,49,0,0,592.050,6,7,signalprocessing,then this is equal to the fourier transform of the sequence , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,50,0,0,597.290,15,16,signalprocessing,so the z transform for z equal to e to the j omega is the fourier transform and so this then corresponds to x of omega , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,51,0,0,611.290,2,3,signalprocessing,namely the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,57,0,0,656.240,4,5,signalprocessing,well in fact the fourier transform is a function of omega , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,59,0,0,662.620,17,18,signalprocessing,and now what we can see is that given the fact that we want to generalize the fourier transform to the z transform it's convenient now to use as notation for the fourier transform x of z with z equal to e to the j omega , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,61,0,0,686.640,14,15,signalprocessing,so just summarizing that our new notation is that the independent variable on the fourier transform is now going to be expressed as e to the j omega rather than as omega , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,64,0,0,718.440,26,27,signalprocessing,but let me draw your attention to the fact that in the laplace transform the independent variable that we ended up with in talking about the fourier transform is different than what we're ending up with here , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,67,0,0,758.100,7,8,signalprocessing,so we have one relationship between the fourier transform and the z transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,68,0,0,763.060,18,19,signalprocessing,namely the fact that for the magnitude of z equal to one the z transform reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,69,0,0,773.390,23,24,signalprocessing,now in the laplace transform we also had another important relationship and observation which was the fact that the laplace transform was the fourier transform of x of t modified , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,73,0,0,805.430,23,24,signalprocessing,in particular in addition to the fact that the z transform for z equal to e to the j omega reduces to the fourier transform we'll see that the z transform for other values of z is the fourier transform of the sequence with an exponential weighting , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,79,0,0,875.530,26,27,signalprocessing,well what this says is that the z transform which is this at z equal to r e to the j omega is in fact the fourier transform of what , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,80,0,0,893.200,2,3,signalprocessing,it's the fourier transform of x of n multiplied by r to the minus n , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,82,0,0,906.200,11,12,signalprocessing,and in continuous time we had the laplace transform as the fourier transform of x of t e to the minus sigma t , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,83,0,0,915.710,4,5,signalprocessing,here we have the fourier transform of x of n r to the minus n , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,97,0,0,1016.460,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier transform as we've seen in earlier lectures is one over one minus a e to the minus j omega , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,99,0,0,1028.540,6,7,signalprocessing,in particular for convergence of the fourier transform we would require absolute summability of the original sequence , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,101,0,0,1042.250,2,3,signalprocessing,so the fourier transform is this provided that the magnitude of a is less than one , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,102,0,0,1048.140,4,5,signalprocessing,and what is the fourier transform if the magnitude of a is not less than one , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,112,0,0,1115.710,6,7,signalprocessing,now the z transform is the fourier transform of the sequence a to the n times r to the minus n , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,113,0,0,1128.090,54,55,signalprocessing,and this statement about the z transform converging is exactly identical to the statement that what we're requiring is that the magnitude of a times r to the minus one be less than one where this represents the exponential factor that we have that in effect is applied to the sequence so that the fourier transform becomes the z transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,114,0,0,1163.430,26,27,signalprocessing,and so if we put this condition we can interpret this condition in exactly the same way that we interpret the condition on convergence of the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,134,0,0,1379.750,22,23,signalprocessing,recall that in the discussion that we just came from when we talked about the relationship between the z transform and the fourier transform the z transform reduces to the fourier transform when the magnitude of z is equal to one , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,137,0,0,1408.880,17,18,signalprocessing,and so it's on this contour in the z plane that the z transform reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,139,0,0,1423.550,31,32,signalprocessing,just again to emphasize the relationships and differences with continuous time with the laplace transform it's the behavior in the s plane on the j omega axis that corresponds to the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,140,0,0,1438.440,15,16,signalprocessing,here it's the behavior on the unit circle where the z transform corresponds to the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,162,0,0,1655.240,12,13,signalprocessing,and so in fact that would say that the sequence has a fourier transform that converges , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,166,0,0,1679.570,16,17,signalprocessing,and so this example with the magnitude of a less than one does not have a fourier transform that converges , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,167,0,0,1687.950,13,14,signalprocessing,well assuming that the magnitude of a is less than one and the fourier transform converges we can in fact look at the fourier transform by observing what happens as we go around the unit circle , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,172,0,0,1744.200,4,5,signalprocessing,and to observe the fourier transform we would observe how those vectors change in length as we move around the unit circle , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,173,0,0,1755.030,26,27,signalprocessing,and as we move around the unit circle what we would trace out in terms of the ratio of the lengths of those vectors is the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,178,0,0,1794.810,8,9,signalprocessing,and so here if we assumed that the fourier transform of the associated sequence converged then again we would look at the behavior of this as we moved around the unit circle , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,180,0,0,1819.060,3,4,signalprocessing,i'm sorry the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,181,0,0,1821.220,2,3,signalprocessing,so the fourier transform magnitude would consist of the ratio of the lengths of the zero vectors divided by the lengths of the pole vectors , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,186,0,0,1865.940,8,9,signalprocessing,so in fact if we looked at the fourier transform associated with this pole zero pattern if this was for example represented the z transform of the impulse response or a linear time invariant system the corresponding frequency response would be what i plotted out below , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,189,0,0,1905.950,11,12,signalprocessing,so as we sweep past this pole then in fact this fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,196,0,0,1958.640,4,5,signalprocessing,and to generate the fourier transform we want to look at the behavior of the pole and zero vectors as we move around the unit circle , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,199,0,0,1978.250,5,6,signalprocessing,and the magnitude of the fourier transform will be as we discussed the magnitude of the length of the zero vector is divided by the magnitude of the length of the pole vectors , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,200,0,0,1990.580,5,6,signalprocessing,shown below will be the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,201,0,0,1994.760,4,5,signalprocessing,and we have the fourier transform displayed here from zero to two pi rather than from minus pi to pi as it was displayed in the transparency , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,202,0,0,2005.640,6,7,signalprocessing,because of the periodicity of the fourier transform both of those are equivalent , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,204,0,0,2020.590,9,10,signalprocessing,and that of course generates a change in the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,206,0,0,2043.370,7,8,signalprocessing,and that generates a residence in the fourier transform very similar to what we saw in continuous time , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,208,0,0,2062.050,8,9,signalprocessing,and so in fact the magnitude of the fourier transform will decrease , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,213,0,0,2104.960,7,8,signalprocessing,and because of the symmetry in the fourier transform what we will see in the magnitude is identical to what we would see if we swept from omega equal to pi back clockwise to omega equals zero , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,218,0,0,2159.400,7,8,signalprocessing,now finally let's also look at the fourier transform associated with the first order example that we discussed earlier in the lecture , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,219,0,0,2171.370,10,11,signalprocessing,and so what we'll want to look at is the fourier transform as the pole and zero vectors change , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,220,0,0,2178.990,3,4,signalprocessing,once again the fourier transform will be displayed on a scale from zero to two pi a frequency scale from zero to two pi rather than minus pi to pi , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,228,0,0,2241.890,9,10,signalprocessing,and so that means that the magnitude of the fourier transform will decrease monotonically until we get past omega equal to pi , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,231,0,0,2281.320,8,9,signalprocessing,since because of the symmetry again of the fourier transform magnitude sweeping from pi to two pi is going to be equivalent with regard to the magnitude to sweeping from pi back to zero , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,232,0,0,2297.400,17,18,signalprocessing,and so now the pole vector begins to decrease in length and correspondingly the magnitude of the fourier transform will increase , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,234,0,0,2318.020,19,20,signalprocessing,and obviously if we continue to sweep around again we would simply trace out other periods associated with the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,236,0,0,2342.760,26,27,signalprocessing,and of course you can see that because the circle is periodic as we go around and around of course what we'll get is a periodic fourier transform which is the way fourier transforms are supposed to be , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,249,0,0,2496.420,12,13,signalprocessing,furthermore as we've already talked about and exploited actually convergence of the fourier transform is equivalent to the statement that the region of convergence includes the unit circle in the z plane , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,252,0,0,2532.550,18,19,signalprocessing,if we have a finite duration sequence so that the sequence is absolutely summable and therefore has a fourier transform that converges then because of the fact that it's zero outside some interval i can multiply it by an exponentially decaying sequence or by an exponentially growing sequence , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,274,0,0,2771.130,10,11,signalprocessing,in other words it's the only one for which the fourier transform converges , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,281,0,0,2819.350,20,21,signalprocessing,but basically what we can use to develop a formal expression is the fact that the z transform is the fourier transform of the sequence exponentially weighted , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,301,0,0,3041.320,31,32,signalprocessing,the principal difference really being that with the laplace transform it was the j omega axis in the s plane that we focused attention on when we were thinking about the fourier transform , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,5,0,0,61.240,16,17,signalprocessing,as with the laplace transform in continuous time we developed it as a generalization of the fourier transform , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,8,0,0,87.660,14,15,signalprocessing,but we focused in particular on the relationship between the z transform and the fourier transform pointing out first of all that the z transform when we choose the magnitude of z equal to one so the magnitude of z of the form e to the j omega just simply reduces to the fourier transform of the sequence , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,10,0,0,122.640,34,35,signalprocessing,in the discrete time z transform case we expressed that complex number in polar form as r e to the j omega and recognize that the z transform expression in fact corresponds to the fourier transform of the sequence exponentially weighted , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,17,0,0,239.780,2,3,signalprocessing,then the convolution property for which the z transform of a convolution of sequences is the product of the associated z transforms , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,20,0,0,274.240,2,3,signalprocessing,with the convolution property the convolution property as in continuous time of course provides a mechanism for dealing with linear time invariant systems , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,22,0,0,302.770,3,4,signalprocessing,because of the convolution property associated with the z transform the z transform of the output is the z transform of the input times the z transform of the impulse response , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,23,0,0,317.580,25,26,signalprocessing,again very much the same as what we had in continuous time and also what we had in the context of the discussion with the fourier transform , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,24,0,0,329.410,12,13,signalprocessing,in fact because of the relationship between the z transform and the fourier transform the z transform of the impulse response evaluated on the unit circle in other words for the magnitude of z equal to one in fact corresponds to the frequency response of the system , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,26,0,0,363.130,2,3,signalprocessing,now the convolution property and these other properties as i indicated we will find useful in talking about systems which are described by linear constant coefficient difference equations and in fact we'll do that shortly , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,32,0,0,451.450,6,7,signalprocessing,furthermore when we talked about the fourier transform , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,33,0,0,455.640,1,2,signalprocessing,the fourier transform of a sequence converges if the sequence is absolutely summable , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,34,0,0,464.500,17,18,signalprocessing,so in fact the condition for stability of a system and the condition for convergence of the fourier transform of its impulse response are the same condition namely absolute summability , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,36,0,0,482.750,7,8,signalprocessing,what it means is that if the fourier transform converges , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,39,0,0,505.210,9,10,signalprocessing,in other words the impulse response must have a fourier transform that converges , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,54,0,0,696.930,21,22,signalprocessing,the three basic properties that play a key role in that discussion are the linearity property the shifting property and the convolution property , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,62,0,0,786.100,6,7,signalprocessing,now what we know from the convolution property is that for a system the z transform of the output is the system function times the z transform of the input , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,97,0,0,1148.500,5,6,signalprocessing,we in fact evaluated the fourier transform associated with this pole zero pattern last time , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,175,0,0,2114.030,16,17,signalprocessing,remembering the issues of sampling the discrete time frequency response then since the frequency responses the fourier transform of the impulse response is related to the continuous time impulse response as i indicate here what this says is that it is the superposition of replications of the continuous time frequency response linearly scaled in frequency and shifted and added to each other , Lecture25FeedbackMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,165,0,0,1553.060,14,15,signalprocessing,and we want to look at frequency response so we'll look specifically at the fourier transform , Lecture25FeedbackMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,166,0,0,1558.620,16,17,signalprocessing,and of course the frequency response of the overall system is the frequency response of the fourier transform of the output divided by the input , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,108,0,0,1052.350,9,10,signalprocessing,well we can answer that by looking at the convolution property , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,9,0,0,129.380,12,13,signalprocessing,later on in the course when we've developed the concept of the fourier transform after that the laplace transform we'll see some very efficient and useful ways of generating solutions both for differential and difference equations , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,272,0,0,2775.560,13,14,signalprocessing,and beginning with the next set of lectures we'll be talking about the fourier transform and much later in the course what's referred to as the laplace transform for continuous time and the z transform for discrete time , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,273,0,0,2790.070,8,9,signalprocessing,and what we'll see is that with the fourier transform and later with the laplace and z transform we'll have a number of efficient and very useful ways of generating the solution for differential and difference equations under the assumption that the system is causal linear and time invariant , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,54,0,0,673.950,15,16,signalprocessing,and what that leads to is a representation of periodic signals through what's called the fourier series , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,56,0,0,689.770,19,20,signalprocessing,and the representation that's developed in terms of linear combinations of complex exponentials is what's referred to as the fourier transform , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,57,0,0,701.240,14,15,signalprocessing,so the first thing we want to deal with are periodic signals and the fourier series , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,58,0,0,709.690,10,11,signalprocessing,so what we're talking about then is the continuous time fourier series , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,59,0,0,717.110,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier series is a representation for periodic continuous time signals , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,73,0,0,849.140,3,4,signalprocessing,now what the fourier series says and we'll justify this bit by bit as the discussion goes on what the fourier series says and in fact what fourier said which was essentially his brilliant insight is that if i have a very general periodic signal i can represent it as a linear combination of these harmonically related complex exponentials , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,75,0,0,881.950,11,12,signalprocessing,and this summation is what will be referred to as the fourier series , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,77,0,0,902.010,17,18,signalprocessing,one is assuming that our periodic signal can be represented this way how do we determine the fourier series coefficients as they're referred to a k , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,82,0,0,935.430,4,5,signalprocessing,this representation of the fourier series which i've repeated again here is what's referred to as the complex exponential form of the fourier series , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,85,0,0,976.700,10,11,signalprocessing,now that complex exponential form is one representation for the fourier series , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,87,0,0,989.300,29,30,signalprocessing,there is another representation that perhaps you've come across previously and that in a variety of other contexts is typically used which is called the trigonometric form for the fourier series , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,89,0,0,1007.240,66,67,signalprocessing,essentially we can get to the trigonometric form from the complex exponential form by recognizing that if we express the complex coefficient in polar form or in rectangular form and expand the complex exponential term out in terms of cosine plus j sine using just simply euler's relation then we will end up with a representation for the periodic signal or a re expression of the fourier series expression that we had previously either in the form that i indicate here where now the periodic signal is expressed in terms of a summation of cosines with appropriate amplitude and phase , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,93,0,0,1096.590,11,12,signalprocessing,however let's look back and the complex exponential form for the fourier series at the top of the board , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,97,0,0,1143.710,5,6,signalprocessing,okay now we have the fourier series representation as i've indicated here , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,108,0,0,1264.400,20,21,signalprocessing,okay well the next step in developing the expression for the coefficient a k is to refer back to the fourier series expression which was that x t is equal to the sum of a k e j k omega zero t , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,112,0,0,1336.140,6,7,signalprocessing,so multiplying both sides of the fourier series and then doing the integration leads us after the appropriate manipulation to the expression that i have up here , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,116,0,0,1381.020,31,32,signalprocessing,and so finally we have what i indicate here taking t zero and moving it over to the other side of the equation that then tells us how we determine the fourier series coefficients a n or a k , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,117,0,0,1400.540,28,29,signalprocessing,so that in effect then is what we refer to as the analysis equation the equation that begins with x t and tells us how to get the fourier series coefficients , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,118,0,0,1414.260,6,7,signalprocessing,what i'll refer to as the fourier series synthesis equation is the equation that tells us how to build x t out of these complex exponentials , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,121,0,0,1442.210,13,14,signalprocessing,so we in effect have gone through the issue of assuming that a fourier series representation is in fact valid how we get the coefficients , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,124,0,0,1469.250,19,20,signalprocessing,but let's first look at just some examples in which we take a signal assume that it has the fourier series representation and see what the fourier series coefficients look like , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,131,0,0,1547.110,5,6,signalprocessing,and so i've expressed the fourier series coefficients as this integral that's from t zero point two to zero , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,139,0,0,1602.830,15,16,signalprocessing,for k equal to zero we can go back to the basic expression for the fourier series which is one t zero the integral over a period x t e j k omega zero t dt , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,144,0,0,1660.050,5,6,signalprocessing,now let's look at these fourier series coefficients on a bar graph , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,146,0,0,1670.610,4,5,signalprocessing,the expression for the fourier series coefficients we just developed , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,151,0,0,1699.890,6,7,signalprocessing,one is the fact that the fourier series coefficients for this example are purely imaginary , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,152,0,0,1709.870,5,6,signalprocessing,a second is that the fourier series coefficients for this example are an odd sequence , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,155,0,0,1728.660,14,15,signalprocessing,and what that results in when you look at the trigonometric form of the fourier series is that in fact those conditions if you put the terms all together lead you to a trigonometric representation which involves only sine terms in other words no cosine terms , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,158,0,0,1767.530,14,15,signalprocessing,so what this says is that for the antisymmetric square wave in effect the fourier series is a sine series , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,163,0,0,1811.720,9,10,signalprocessing,in other words for even values of k the fourier series coefficients are zero , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,173,0,0,1880.630,6,7,signalprocessing,so if we look at the fourier series coefficients for this , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,175,0,0,1891.350,6,7,signalprocessing,here i've plotted pi times the fourier series coefficients , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,206,0,0,2167.150,14,15,signalprocessing,so this is the square wave that we want to build up through the fourier series as a sum of sinusoids , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,212,0,0,2223.230,4,5,signalprocessing,here we show the fourier series with k two and there's no change , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,223,0,0,2298.530,39,40,signalprocessing,and notice that it is the higher order terms that tend to build up the discontinuity corresponding to the notion that the discontinuity or sharp edges in a signal in fact are represented through the higher frequencies in the fourier series , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,227,0,0,2340.180,7,8,signalprocessing,and it's an inherent part of the fourier series representation at discontinuities , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,236,0,0,2428.590,18,19,signalprocessing,and in fact something that will stand out more and more as we go through our discussion of fourier series and fourier transforms is that general statement that it's the low frequency terms that represent the broad time behavior and it's the high frequency terms that are used to build up the sharp transitions in the time domain , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,237,0,0,2460.060,17,18,signalprocessing,now we need to get a little more precise about the question of how in fact the fourier series or when the fourier series represents the functions that we're talking about and in what sense they represent them , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,248,0,0,2549.770,15,16,signalprocessing,but it relates to what it's referred to as the issue of convergence of the fourier series , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,249,0,0,2557.010,5,6,signalprocessing,and the convergence of the fourier series the bottom line on it the kind of end statement can be made in several ways , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,250,0,0,2567.710,8,9,signalprocessing,one statement related to the convergence of the fourier series is the following , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,268,0,0,2775.310,10,11,signalprocessing,and we want to again show the buildup of the fourier series , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,284,0,0,2895.070,13,14,signalprocessing,and now what we'll do is increase the number of terms in the fourier series and watch the energy in the error decreasing always decreasing of course on the inclusion of the odd numbered terms and not on the inclusion of the even numbered terms because of the fact that it's an odd harmonic function , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,285,0,0,2918.030,15,16,signalprocessing,now the energy in the error asymptotically will approach zero although point by point the fourier series will never be equal to the square wave , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,287,0,0,2946.190,11,12,signalprocessing,so what we've seen then is a quick look at the fourier series representation of periodic signals , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,292,0,0,2992.810,37,38,signalprocessing,the basic strategy with an aperiodic signal is to think of representing this aperiodic signal as a linear combination of complex exponentials by the simple trick of periodically replicating this signal generating a periodic signal using a fourier series representation for that periodic signal and then simply letting the period go to infinity , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,294,0,0,3035.520,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier series representation then becomes what we'll refer to the fourier transform , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,296,0,0,3050.140,17,18,signalprocessing,in the next lecture we'll develop this a little more carefully and more fully moving from the fourier series which we've used for periodic signals to develop the fourier transform which will then be representation for aperiodic signals , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,4,0,0,65.560,14,15,signalprocessing,and for the class of periodic signals specifically what this led to was the fourier series representation for periodic signals , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,79.110,8,9,signalprocessing,for periodic signals we had the continuous time fourier series where we built the periodic signal out of a linear combination of harmonically related complex exponentials , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,0,0,123.090,6,7,signalprocessing,then the other side of the fourier series is what i referred to as the analysis equation , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,130.380,14,15,signalprocessing,and the analysis equation was the equation that told us how we get the fourier series coefficients from x of t , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,139.110,11,12,signalprocessing,and so this equation together with the synthesis equation represent the fourier series description for periodic signals , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,19,0,0,232.490,9,10,signalprocessing,so the basic idea then is to use the fourier series to represent the periodic signal and then examine the fourier series expression as we let the period go to infinity , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,22,0,0,262.079,12,13,signalprocessing,and what we want to inquire into is what happens to the fourier series expression for this as we let the period go to infinity , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,23,0,0,271.750,4,5,signalprocessing,as that happens whatever fourier series representation we end up with will correspond also to a representation for this aperiodic signal , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,25,0,0,284.220,1,2,signalprocessing,the fourier series synthesis expression for the periodic signal expresses x tilde of t the periodic signal as a linear combination of harmonically related complex exponentials with the fundamental frequency omega zero equaled to two pi divided by the period , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,30,0,0,335.510,5,6,signalprocessing,so this tells us the fourier series coefficients in terms of x of t , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,32,0,0,374.830,29,30,signalprocessing,said another way let's define a function as i've indicated here which is this integral where we may think of omega as being a continuous variable and then the fourier series coefficients correspond to substituting for omega k omega zero , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,34,0,0,411.250,10,11,signalprocessing,and this in fact then is an envelope of the fourier series coefficients , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,36,0,0,430.540,10,11,signalprocessing,so this in effect tells us how to get the fourier series coefficients of the periodic signal in terms of samples of an envelope , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,46,0,0,542.740,11,12,signalprocessing,so the resulting equation that we get out of the original fourier series synthesis equation is the equation that i indicate down here x of t synthesized in terms of this integral which is what the fourier series approaches as omega zero goes to zero , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,48,0,0,576.900,6,7,signalprocessing,and we have then the corresponding fourier transform analysis equation which tells us how we arrive at that envelope in terms of x of t , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,51,0,0,634.160,6,7,signalprocessing,and this periodic signal has a fourier series and we express the fourier series coefficients of this as samples of an envelope function , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,53,0,0,651.520,7,8,signalprocessing,so this is the envelope of the fourier series coefficients , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,54,0,0,655.390,14,15,signalprocessing,for example if the period t zero was four times t one then the fourier series coefficients that we would end up with is this set of samples of the envelope , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,55,0,0,670.480,8,9,signalprocessing,if instead we doubled that period then the fourier series coefficients that we end up with are more finely spaced , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,59,0,0,718.440,11,12,signalprocessing,so here we have the square wave and below it the fourier series coefficients , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,60,0,0,723.010,8,9,signalprocessing,and we now want to look at the fourier series coefficients as the period of the square wave starts to increase , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,62,0,0,744.100,7,8,signalprocessing,and in fact the envelope of the fourier series coefficients is shown in the bottom and to emphasize in fact that it is the envelope let's superimpose it on top of the fourier series coefficients that we've generated so far , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,64,0,0,768.710,11,12,signalprocessing,now let's increase the period even further and we'll see the fourier series coefficients fill in under that envelope function even more , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,68,0,0,808.030,22,23,signalprocessing,let's once again plot the envelope function and again to emphasize that we've generated samples of that let's superimpose that on the fourier series coefficients , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,69,0,0,826.300,8,9,signalprocessing,so what we have then is now our fourier transform representation the continuous time fourier transform with the synthesis equation expressed as an integral as i've indicated here and this integral is what the fourier series sum went to as we let the period go to infinity or the frequency go to zero , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,71,0,0,859.080,11,12,signalprocessing,the analysis equation being the expression for the envelope of the fourier series coefficients for the periodically replicated signal , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,72,0,0,870.620,12,13,signalprocessing,and in shorthand notation we would think of x of t and fourier transform as a pair as i've indicated here , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,73,0,0,880.380,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier transform as we'll emphasize in several examples and certainly as is consistent with the fourier series is a complex valued function even when x of t is real , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,74,0,0,895.730,11,12,signalprocessing,so with x of t real we end up with a fourier transform which is a complex function , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,75,0,0,901.770,3,4,signalprocessing,just as the fourier series coefficients were complex for a real value time function , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,76,0,0,908.250,7,8,signalprocessing,so we could alternatively as with the fourier series , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,77,0,0,912.420,2,3,signalprocessing,express the fourier transform in terms of it's real part and imaginary part or alternatively in terms of its magnitude and its angle , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,78,0,0,928.270,14,15,signalprocessing,all right now let's look at an example of a time function in its fourier transform , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,82,0,0,949.520,1,2,signalprocessing,it's fourier transform is the integral from minus infinity to plus infinity x of t e to the minus j omega t dt , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,86,0,0,998.870,9,10,signalprocessing,and so what we have finally is for the fourier transform expression one over a plus j omega , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,87,0,0,1012.700,2,3,signalprocessing,now this fourier transform as i indicated is a complex valued function , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,89,0,0,1024.210,6,7,signalprocessing,we have the expression for the fourier transform pair e to the minus a t times , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,90,0,0,1032.839,2,3,signalprocessing,and its fourier transform is one over a plus j omega , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,92,0,0,1042.609,42,43,signalprocessing,now in the expression that we just worked out if a is less than zero in fact the expression doesn't converge e to the minus a t for a negative as t goes to infinity blows up and so in fact the fourier transform doesn't converge except for the case where a is greater than zero and in fact there is a more detailed discussion of convergence issues in the text , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,93,0,0,1074.990,10,11,signalprocessing,the convergence issues are very much the same for the fourier transform as they are for the fourier series , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,94,0,0,1080.860,10,11,signalprocessing,and in fact that's not surprising because we developed the fourier transform out of a consideration of the fourier series , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,96,0,0,1102.290,6,7,signalprocessing,ok now if we plot the fourier transform let's first consider the shape of the time function , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,99,0,0,1122.920,4,5,signalprocessing,the magnitude of the fourier transform is as i indicate here and the phase below it , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,100,0,0,1133.970,17,18,signalprocessing,and there are a number of things we can see about the magnitude and phase of the fourier transform for this example which in fact we'll see in the next lecture are properties that apply more generally , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,101,0,0,1150.210,6,7,signalprocessing,for example the fact that the fourier transform magnitude is an even function of frequency and the phase is an odd function of frequency , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,103,0,0,1172.830,8,9,signalprocessing,in other words in our expression for the fourier transform it requires both omega positive and omega negative , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,104,0,0,1183.920,12,13,signalprocessing,this of course was exactly the same in the case of the fourier series , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,107,0,0,1214.700,14,15,signalprocessing,so it's important to keep in mind that in our case both with the fourier series and the fourier transform we deal and require both positive and negative frequencies in order to build our signals , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,109,0,0,1240.360,7,8,signalprocessing,and that's one graphical representation for the fourier transform that we'll typically use , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,120,0,0,1330.190,10,11,signalprocessing,and i indicated that there is a symmetry to the fourier transform and so in fact we can infer from this particular picture what it looks like for the negative frequencies as well as for the positive frequencies , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,121,0,0,1349.560,10,11,signalprocessing,now what we've done so far is to develop the fourier transform on the basis the fourier transform of an aperiodic signal on the basis of periodically repeating it and recognizing that the fourier series coefficients are samples of an envelope and that these become more finely spaced as frequency increases , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,122,0,0,1379.990,26,27,signalprocessing,and in fact we can go back to our original equation in which we developed an envelope function and what we had indicated is that the fourier series coefficients were samples of this envelope , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,123,0,0,1402.920,7,8,signalprocessing,we then defined this envelope as the fourier transform of this aperiodic signal , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,125,0,0,1424.810,22,23,signalprocessing,now suppose that we have instead a periodic signal are there in fact some statements that we can make about how the fourier series coefficients of that are related to the fourier transform of something , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,127,0,0,1447.390,9,10,signalprocessing,what this statement says is that in fact the fourier series coefficients are samples of the fourier transform of one period , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,128,0,0,1459.180,14,15,signalprocessing,so if we now consider a periodic signal we can in fact get the fourier series coefficients of that periodic signal by considering the fourier transform of one period , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,129,0,0,1478.630,4,5,signalprocessing,said another way the fourier series coefficients are proportional to samples of the fourier transform of one period , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,130,0,0,1487.670,10,11,signalprocessing,so if we consider this a periodic signal computed as fourier transform and selected these samples that i indicate here namely samples equally spaced in omega by integer multiples of omega zero then in fact those would be the fourier series coefficients , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,132,0,0,1527.190,25,26,signalprocessing,and now in this case we could argue that if in fact it was the periodic signal that we started with we could get the fourier series coefficients of that by thinking about the fourier transform of one period which i indicate here , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,133,0,0,1549.590,3,4,signalprocessing,and then the fourier series coefficients of the periodic signal in fact are the appropriate set of samples of this envelope , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,134,0,0,1564.710,10,11,signalprocessing,all right now we have a way of getting the fourier series coefficients from the fourier transform of one period , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,135,0,0,1574.930,4,5,signalprocessing,we originally derived the fourier transform of one period from the fourier series , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,136,0,0,1581.420,12,13,signalprocessing,what would in fact be nice is if we could incorporate the fourier series and the fourier transform within a common framework , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,138,0,0,1598.040,21,22,signalprocessing,essentially if we consider what the equation for the synthesis looks like in both cases we can in effect define a fourier transform for the periodic signal which we know is represented by its fourier series coefficients , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,139,0,0,1619.360,4,5,signalprocessing,we can define a fourier transform and the definition of the fourier transform is as an impulse train where the coefficients in the impulse train are proportional with a proportionality factor of two pi for a more or less a bookkeeping reason proportional to the fourier series coefficients , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,141,0,0,1650.860,9,10,signalprocessing,specifically here is then the synthesis equation for the fourier transform if we substitute this definition for the fourier transform of the periodic signal into this expression then when we do the appropriate bookkeeping and interchange the order of summation and integration the impulse integrates out to the exponential factor that we want , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,143,0,0,1685.820,3,4,signalprocessing,we have the fourier series coefficients , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,144,0,0,1687.990,24,25,signalprocessing,the two pis take care of each other and what we're left with is the synthesis equation for aperiodic signal in terms of the fourier transform or in terms of its fourier series coefficients , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,146,0,0,1710.230,28,29,signalprocessing,if we consider the example of a symmetric square wave then in effect what we're saying is that for this symmetric square wave this has a set of fourier series coefficients which we worked out previously and which i indicate on this figure with a bar graph , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,147,0,0,1732.440,10,11,signalprocessing,and really all that we're saying is that whereas these fourier series coefficients are indexed on an integer variable k and bars not impulses , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,148,0,0,1744.790,7,8,signalprocessing,if we simply redefine or define the fourier transform of the periodic signal as an impulse train where the weights of the impulses are two pi times the corresponding fourier series coefficients then this in fact is what we would use as the fourier transform of the periodic signal , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,156,0,0,1841.500,9,10,signalprocessing,x tilde of t the periodic signal has a fourier series , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,157,0,0,1845.550,12,13,signalprocessing,and as its period increases that approaches the aperiodic signal and the fourier series of that approaches the fourier transform of the original aperiodic signal , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,159,0,0,1865.700,16,17,signalprocessing,now the second thing that we recognize is that once we have the concept of the fourier transform we can in fact relate the fourier series coefficients to the fourier transform of one period , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,160,0,0,1882.210,23,24,signalprocessing,so the second statement that we made was that if in fact we're trying to represent a periodic signal we can get the fourier series coefficients of that by computing the fourier transform of one period and then samples of that fourier transform are in fact the fourier series coefficients for the periodic signal , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,161,0,0,1913.210,16,17,signalprocessing,then the third step that we took was to inquire as to whether there is a fourier transform that can appropriately be defined for the periodic signal and the mechanism for doing that was to recognize that if we simply defined the fourier transform of the periodic signal as an impulse train where the impulse heights or areas were proportional to the fourier series coefficients then in fact the fourier transform synthesis equation reduced to the fourier series synthesis equation , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,163,0,0,1957.960,1,2,signalprocessing,the fourier transform of that periodic signal defined as an impulse train where the heights or areas of the impulses are proportional to the fourier series coefficients provides us with a mechanism for combining it together the concepts or notation of the fourier series and fourier transform , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,164,0,0,1980.900,27,28,signalprocessing,so if we just took a very simple example here is an example in which we have an aperiodic signal which is just an impulse and its fourier transform is just a constant , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,167,0,0,2012.300,1,2,signalprocessing,the fourier transform of this is a constant , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,168,0,0,2015.720,6,7,signalprocessing,and this of course has a fourier series representation , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,169,0,0,2018.970,2,3,signalprocessing,so the fourier transform of the original impulse is just a constant , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,170,0,0,2026.170,1,2,signalprocessing,the fourier transform of the periodic signal is an impulse train where the heights of the impulses are proportional to the fourier series coefficients , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,171,0,0,2038.830,9,10,signalprocessing,and of course we could previously have computed the fourier series coefficients for that impulse train and those fourier series coefficients are as i've shown here , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,173,0,0,2059.199,15,16,signalprocessing,and both of these simply represent samples of what we have above which is the fourier transform of the original aperiodic signal , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,175,0,0,2088.810,21,22,signalprocessing,basically what we've tried to do is incorporate within one framework a representation for both aperiodic and periodic signals and the fourier transform provides us with a mechanism to do that , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,176,0,0,2104.410,13,14,signalprocessing,in the next lecture i'll continue with the discussion of the continuous time fourier transform in particular focusing on a number of its properties some of which we've already seen namely the symmetry properties , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,177,0,0,2118.000,13,14,signalprocessing,we'll see lots of other properties that relate of course both to the fourier transform and to the fourier series , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,4,0,0,64.440,5,6,signalprocessing,and this led to the fourier series representation in the periodic case and it led to the fourier transform representation in the aperiodic case , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,5,0,0,74.950,11,12,signalprocessing,and then in fact what we did was to incorporate the fourier series within the framework of the fourier transform , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,85.480,12,13,signalprocessing,what i'd like to do in today's lecture is look at the fourier transform more closely in particular with regard to some of its properties , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,7,0,0,95.050,15,16,signalprocessing,so let me begin by reminding you of the analysis and synthesis equations for the fourier transform as i've summarized them here , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,127.970,25,26,signalprocessing,so essentially in the decomposition of x of t as a linear combination of complex exponentials the complex amplitudes of those are in effect the fourier transform scaled by the differential and scaled by one over two pi , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,146.670,6,7,signalprocessing,as i indicated last time the fourier transform is a complex function of frequency , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,13,0,0,164.770,4,5,signalprocessing,the symmetry of the fourier transform when x of t is real is what is referred to as conjugate symmetric , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,16,0,0,184.930,16,17,signalprocessing,and a consequence of that if we think in terms of the real part of the fourier transform the real part is an even function of frequency and the magnitude is an even function of frequency , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,18,0,0,211.170,25,26,signalprocessing,so we have this symmetry relationship that for x of t real if we think of either the real part or the magnitude of the fourier transform it's even symmetric , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,21,0,0,233.740,18,19,signalprocessing,let's look at an example in the context of an example that we worked last time for the fourier transform , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,23,0,0,251.550,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier transform as we found was of the algebraic form one over a plus j omega , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,24,0,0,260.089,3,4,signalprocessing,and incidentally the fourier transform integral only converged for a greater than zero , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,28,0,0,294.050,56,57,signalprocessing,so in fact although i stressed last time that the complex exponentials is required to build a time function require exponentials of both positive and negative frequencies for x of t real what we see is that because of these symmetry properties either for the real and imaginary or magnitude and angle we can specify the fourier transform for let's say only positive frequencies , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,29,0,0,324.630,10,11,signalprocessing,and the symmetry then implies or tells us what the fourier transform then would be for the negative frequencies , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,31,0,0,339.480,9,10,signalprocessing,demonstrates another important and often useful property of the fourier transform , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,33,0,0,354.350,7,8,signalprocessing,so we have again the exponential whose fourier transform is one over a plus j omega , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,38,0,0,401.300,2,3,signalprocessing,whereas its fourier transform or the magnitude of its fourier transform has the inverse property that as a gets smaller in fact this scales down in frequency , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,39,0,0,416.840,8,9,signalprocessing,well this is a general property of the fourier transform namely the fact that a linear scaling in time generates the inverse linear scaling in frequency , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,69,0,0,754.590,24,25,signalprocessing,you can look at the algebra more carefully at your leisure but essentially what this says is that if x of omega is the fourier transform of a time function x of t then in fact x of t is very much like the fourier transform of x of omega , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,70,0,0,780.180,4,5,signalprocessing,in fact it's the fourier transform of x of minus omega to account for this minus sign , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,72,0,0,790.550,24,25,signalprocessing,so the duality relationship which follows from these two equations in fact says that if x of t and x of omega are a fourier transform pair if x and x are a fourier transform pair then x in fact has a fourier transform which is proportional to x turned around , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,73,0,0,815.910,6,7,signalprocessing,this duality in the continuous time fourier transform is very important , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,75,0,0,824.110,12,13,signalprocessing,it by the way is not a duality that surfaced in the fourier series because as you recall the fourier series begins with a continuous time function and in the frequency domain generates a sequence which would just naturally have problems associated with it if we attempted to interpret a duality , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,76,0,0,848.580,21,22,signalprocessing,and we'll see also that in the discrete time case one of the important differences between continuous time and discrete time fourier transforms is the fact that in continuous time we have duality in the discrete time fourier transform we don't , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,78,0,0,872.400,7,8,signalprocessing,here are in fact two examples of fourier transform pairs taken from examples in the text , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,80,0,0,892.310,2,3,signalprocessing,and its fourier transform corresponds to a rectangular shape in the frequency domain , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,82,0,0,911.590,13,14,signalprocessing,and in example four point ten we begin with a rectangle and its fourier transform is of the form of a sine x over x function , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,87,0,0,970.830,14,15,signalprocessing,one thing this says of course is that essentially any time you've calculated the fourier transform of one time function then you've actually calculated the fourier transform of two time functions , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,89,0,0,992.370,17,18,signalprocessing,also somewhat related to duality is what is referred to as parseval's relation for the continuous time fourier transform , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,91,0,0,1007.880,18,19,signalprocessing,as a summary of it says that the energy in a time function and the energy in its fourier transform are proportional the proportionality factor being a factor of two pi , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,95,0,0,1045.770,4,5,signalprocessing,although we've incorporated the fourier series within a framework of the fourier transform parseval's relation needs to be modified slightly for fourier series because of the fact that a periodic signal has an infinite amount of energy in it and essentially that form of parseval's relationship for the periodic case would say infinity equals infinity which isn't too useful , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,97,0,0,1097.020,19,20,signalprocessing,in other words the energy in one period is proportional to the energy in the sequence that represents the fourier series coefficients , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,102,0,0,1144.600,14,15,signalprocessing,and the time shifting property says if i have a time function with a fourier transform x of omega if i shift that time function in time then that corresponds to multiplying the fourier transform by this factor , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,105,0,0,1201.110,31,32,signalprocessing,another property and in fact a pair of properties that we'll make reference to as we turn our attention toward the end of this lecture to solving differential equations using the fourier transform is what's referred to as the differentiation property and its companion which is the integration property , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,106,0,0,1226.600,12,13,signalprocessing,the differentiation property says again if we have a time function with fourier transform x of omega the fourier transform of the time derivative of that corresponds to multiplying the fourier transform by a linear function of frequency , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,114,0,0,1295.300,47,48,signalprocessing,so the integration property which is the inverse of the differentiation property says that we divide the transform by j omega and then if in fact there was a constant added to x of t we have to account for that by inserting an impulse into the fourier transform , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,115,0,0,1318.220,42,43,signalprocessing,and the final property that i want to draw your attention to on this view graph is the linearity property which is very straightforward to demonstrate from the analysis and synthesis equations which simply says if x one of omega is the fourier transform x one of t and x two of omega is the fourier transform of x two of t then the fourier transform of a linear combination is a linear combination of the fourier transforms , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,116,0,0,1352.700,14,15,signalprocessing,let me emphasize also that these properties for the most part apply both to fourier series and fourier transforms because in fact what we've done is to incorporate the fourier series within the framework of the fourier transform , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,118,0,0,1379.350,27,28,signalprocessing,however before we do that i'd like to focus on two additional major properties and these are what i refer to as the convolution property and the modulation property , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,119,0,0,1393.780,4,5,signalprocessing,and in fact the convolution property as i'm about to introduce it forms the mathematical and conceptual basis for the whole notion of filtering which in fact will be a topic by itself in a set of lectures and in fact is a chapter by itself in the textbook , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,120,0,0,1416.700,7,8,signalprocessing,similarly what i'll refer to as the modulation property , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,122,0,0,1432.160,6,7,signalprocessing,let me just indicate what the convolution property is , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,123,0,0,1438.450,10,11,signalprocessing,and what the convolution property tells us is that the fourier transform of the convolution of two time functions is the product of their fourier transforms , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,124,0,0,1459.620,49,50,signalprocessing,so it says for example that if i have a linear time invariant system and i have an input x of t an impulse response h of t and the output of course being the convolution then in fact if i look at this in the frequency domain the fourier transform of the output is the fourier transform of the input times the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,125,0,0,1493.190,15,16,signalprocessing,you can demonstrate this property algebraically by essentially taking the convolution integral and applying the fourier transform and doing the appropriate interchanging of the order of integration et cetera , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,127,0,0,1516.560,10,11,signalprocessing,and the intuitive interpretation stems from the relationship between the fourier transform of the impulse response and what we've referred to as the frequency response , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,131,0,0,1557.510,16,17,signalprocessing,and in fact the expression for the frequency response is identical to the expression for the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,132,0,0,1567.710,8,9,signalprocessing,in other words the frequency response is the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,133,0,0,1575.750,9,10,signalprocessing,now in that context how can we interpret the convolution property , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,139,0,0,1648.610,4,5,signalprocessing,so in fact the convolution property simply is telling us that in terms of the decomposition of the signal in terms of complex exponentials as we push that signal through a linear time invariant system we're separately multiplying by the frequency response the amplitudes of the exponential components used to build the input , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,141,0,0,1688.630,25,26,signalprocessing,i understand that going through that involves a little bit of sorting out and i strongly encourage you to try to understand and interpret the convolution property in those conceptual terms rather than simply by applying the mathematics to the convolution integral and seeing the terms match up on both sides , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,142,0,0,1713.930,4,5,signalprocessing,as i indicated the convolution property forms the basis for what's referred to as filtering , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,143,0,0,1721.580,26,27,signalprocessing,and this is a topic that we'll be treating in a considerable amount of detail after we've also gone through a discussion of the discrete time fourier transform in the next several lectures , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,146,0,0,1760.030,1,2,signalprocessing,the convolution property told us that if we look at the individual frequency components they get multiplied by the frequency response and so what that says is that we can amplify or attenuate any of those components separately using a linear time invariant system , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,152,0,0,1829.680,8,9,signalprocessing,recall that the differentiation property said that the fourier transform of the differentiated signal is the fourier transform of the original signal multiplied by j omega , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,154,0,0,1852.490,4,5,signalprocessing,in other words the fourier transform of the output is j omega times the fourier transform of the input , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,178,0,0,2058.020,11,12,signalprocessing,when we talked about square waves and we saw how the fourier series built up a square wave we saw that it was the high frequencies that were required in order to build up the sharp edges , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,185,0,0,2135.540,29,30,signalprocessing,i'd now like to comment on another property which is also as i indicated a topic in its own right and which really is the dual property to the convolution property and in fact could be argued directly from duality , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,186,0,0,2153.360,8,9,signalprocessing,and that is what's referred to as the modulation property , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,187,0,0,2159.230,1,2,signalprocessing,the convolution property told us that if we convolve in the time domain we multiply in the frequency domain , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,189,0,0,2183.140,8,9,signalprocessing,and in fact that is exactly what the modulation property is , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,191,0,0,2197.880,2,3,signalprocessing,whereas the convolution property is just the dual of that namely convolving in the time domain corresponds to multiplication in the frequency domain , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,192,0,0,2209.040,1,2,signalprocessing,the convolution property is the basis as i indicated for filtering , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,193,0,0,2214.390,1,2,signalprocessing,the modulation property as i've summarized it here in fact is the entire basis for amplitude modulation systems as used almost universally in communications , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,194,0,0,2230.080,36,37,signalprocessing,and what the modulation property as we'll see when we explore it in more detail tells us is that if we have a signal with a certain spectrum and we multiply by a sinusoidal signal whose fourier transform is a set of impulses then in a frequency domain we convolve , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,197,0,0,2272.960,25,26,signalprocessing,we've seen a number of properties and i indicated sometime earlier when we talked about differential equations that in fact it's the properties of the fourier transform that provide us with a very useful and important mechanism for solving linear constant coefficient differential equations , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,203,0,0,2362.320,37,38,signalprocessing,and it's because of the fact that we're assuming that it's a linear time invariant system that we can describe it in the frequency domain through the convolution property and we can use the properties of the fourier transform , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,207,0,0,2397.080,2,3,signalprocessing,if we fourier transform this entire expression the differentiation property tells us that the fourier transform of the derivative of the output is the fourier transform of the output multiplied by j omega , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,208,0,0,2414.560,7,8,signalprocessing,and linearity will let us write the fourier transform of this as a times y of omega , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,210,0,0,2429.330,6,7,signalprocessing,and x of omega is the fourier transform of x of t , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,213,0,0,2452.980,1,2,signalprocessing,the fourier transform of the output in terms of x of omega , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,214,0,0,2457.420,1,2,signalprocessing,the fourier transform of the input and a simple algebraic step gets us to this expression , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,215,0,0,2465.430,2,3,signalprocessing,so the fourier transform of the output is one over j omega plus a times the fourier transform of the input , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,218,0,0,2487.540,5,6,signalprocessing,well we know that the fourier transform of the output is the fourier transform of the input times the fourier transform of the impulse response of the system namely the frequency response , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,219,0,0,2501.830,16,17,signalprocessing,so in fact if we think of h of t and h of omega as a fourier transform pair it's the convolution property that lets us equate this term with h of omega , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,220,0,0,2518.295,5,6,signalprocessing,so here we're using the convolution property , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,221,0,0,2526.170,5,6,signalprocessing,so we know what the fourier transform of the impulse response is namely one over j omega plus a , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,224,0,0,2548.690,8,9,signalprocessing,we can attempt to go through the inverse fourier transform expression , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,228,0,0,2571.000,25,26,signalprocessing,so what that says is remember that we worked an example and in fact i showed you the example earlier in the lecture that the fourier transform of e to the minus at times the step is one over j omega plus a , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,232,0,0,2606.940,7,8,signalprocessing,i've drawn graphically the magnitude of the fourier transform here , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,239,0,0,2687.620,13,14,signalprocessing,just to illustrate one additional step in both evaluating inverse transforms and using fourier transform properties to solve linear constant coefficient differential equations let's take the same example and rather than finding the impulse response let's find the response to another exponential input , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,246,0,0,2746.030,3,4,signalprocessing,and again we fourier transform the equation , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,247,0,0,2751.700,6,7,signalprocessing,and we can remember this particular fourier transform pair , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,250,0,0,2765.430,29,30,signalprocessing,and now if we want to determine what the output y of t is we can do that by solving for y of omega and then generating the inverse fourier transform , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,252,0,0,2785.460,5,6,signalprocessing,and this is not a fourier transform that we've worked out before , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,254,0,0,2796.190,5,6,signalprocessing,what we have is a fourier transform which is a product of two terms each of which we can recognize , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,256,0,0,2812.160,8,9,signalprocessing,because of the linearity property associated with the fourier transform the inverse transform is then the sum of the inverse transform of each of those terms , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,259,0,0,2835.440,17,18,signalprocessing,we now have the sum of two terms and if we now recognize by inspection the inverse fourier transform of this we see that it's simply minus e to the minus two t times the unit step , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,263,0,0,2901.110,15,16,signalprocessing,hopefully you're beginning to get some sense now of how powerful and also beautiful the fourier transform is ]

Concept = FSF41
Keyword = [Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,82,0,0,932.130,12,13,signalprocessing,and what i show here is the frequency response of an ideal lowpass filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,83,0,0,939.990,2,3,signalprocessing,the ideal lowpass filter of course passes exactly with a gain of one frequencies around zero and eliminates totally other frequencies , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,86,0,0,978.210,10,11,signalprocessing,so obviously the frequency response must periodically repeat for the lowpass filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,88,0,0,986.700,5,6,signalprocessing,if we look at the lowpass filter then we've eliminated some frequencies , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,92,0,0,1029.180,15,16,signalprocessing,well just as we talk about a lowpass filter we can also talk about a highpass filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,93,0,0,1035.609,2,3,signalprocessing,and a highpass filter of course would pass high frequencies , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,98,0,0,1065.400,8,9,signalprocessing,if we think in the context of the lowpass filter these are low frequencies , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,101,0,0,1089.030,5,6,signalprocessing,in particular then an ideal highpass filter in the discrete time case would be a filter that eliminates these frequencies and passes frequencies around pi , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,134,0,0,1412.140,32,33,signalprocessing,and one of the things that we notice and this is drawn for a positive between zero and one what we notice in fact is that it is an approximation to a lowpass filter because it tends to attenuate the high frequencies and retain and in fact amplify the low frequencies , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,137,0,0,1452.980,7,8,signalprocessing,and that becomes an approximation to a highpass filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,138,0,0,1459.790,34,35,signalprocessing,so in fact a first order difference equation as we see has a frequency response depending on the value of a that either looks approximately like a lowpass filter for a positive or a highpass filter for a negative very much like the first order differential equation looked like a lowpass filter in the continuous time case , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,144,0,0,1548.270,32,33,signalprocessing,so let's watch the filtering first with a positive and we'll see it behave as a lowpass filter and then with a negative and we'll see the difference equation behaving as a highpass filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,231,0,0,2443.060,18,19,signalprocessing,now it's interesting that what that says is that if we have a system which corresponds to a lowpass filter as i indicate here with an impulse response h of n , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,232,0,0,2463.320,8,9,signalprocessing,and it can be any approximation to a lowpass filter and even an ideal lowpass filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,233,0,0,2469.860,8,9,signalprocessing,if we want to convert that to a highpass filter we can do that by generating a new system whose impulse response is minus one to the n times the impulse response of the lowpass filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,235,0,0,2504.600,16,17,signalprocessing,this also says incidentally that if we look at an ideal lowpass filter and an ideal highpass filter and we choose the cutoff frequencies for comparison or the bandwidth of the filter to be equal , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,236,0,0,2524.650,3,4,signalprocessing,since this ideal highpass filter is this ideal lowpass filter with the frequency response shifted by pi the modulation property tells us that in the time domain what that corresponds to is an impulse response multiplied by minus one to the n , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,237,0,0,2546.950,9,10,signalprocessing,so it says that the impulse response of the highpass filter or equivalently the inverse fourier transform of the highpass filter frequency response is minus one to the n times the impulse response for the lowpass filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,244,0,0,2604.520,10,11,signalprocessing,suppose we have a system that we know is a lowpass filter and it's a good lowpass filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,245,0,0,2611.410,7,8,signalprocessing,how might we use it as a highpass filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,246,0,0,2614.800,50,51,signalprocessing,well one way to do it instead of shifting its frequency response is to take the original signal shift its low frequencies to high frequencies and its high frequencies to low frequencies by multiplying the input signal the original signal by minus one to the n process that with a lowpass filter where now what's sitting at the low frequencies were the high frequencies , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,249,0,0,2650.060,9,10,signalprocessing,let's suppose for example that this system was a lowpass filter and so it lowpass filters whatever comes into it , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,254,0,0,2688.560,16,17,signalprocessing,and that in fact turns out to be a very useful notion for applying a fixed lowpass filter to do highpass filtering and vice versa , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,15,0,0,207.810,25,26,signalprocessing,so we have as you recall first of all the notion in continuous time of an ideal filter for example i illustrate here an ideal lowpass filter where we pass exactly frequency components in one band and reject totally frequency components in another band , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,16,0,0,231.940,17,17,signalprocessing,the band being passed of course referred to as the passband and the band rejected as the stopband , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,17,0,0,240.030,4,5,signalprocessing,i illustrated here a lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,19,0,0,248.930,7,8,signalprocessing,and that then corresponds to an ideal highpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,24,0,0,275.200,7,8,signalprocessing,namely we have an ideal discrete time lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,27,0,0,292.260,5,6,signalprocessing,we show also an ideal highpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,28,0,0,296.630,2,3,signalprocessing,and a highpass filter as i indicated last time passes frequencies around pi , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,31,0,0,329.960,12,13,signalprocessing,now let's look at these ideal filters and in particular the ideal lowpass filter in the time domain , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,32,0,0,339.320,8,9,signalprocessing,we have the frequency response of the ideal lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,34,0,0,349.580,15,16,signalprocessing,so here is the frequency response and below it the impulse response of the ideal lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,37,0,0,379.150,18,19,signalprocessing,and notice also since i want to refer back to this that the impulse response of an ideal lowpass filter in fact is non causal , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,40,0,0,401.680,7,8,signalprocessing,so the impulse response of the ideal lowpass filter is symmetric and continues to have tails off to plus and minus infinity , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,42,0,0,419.610,15,16,signalprocessing,let's look at the frequency response and associated impulse response for an ideal discrete time lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,43,0,0,428.200,11,12,signalprocessing,so once again here is the frequency response of the ideal lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,53,0,0,511.260,26,27,signalprocessing,one example of this that's elaborated on in the text is the design of an automotive suspension system which in fact is the design of a lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,57,0,0,564.300,8,9,signalprocessing,for example let's look back at the ideal lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,60,0,0,577.090,12,13,signalprocessing,let's now look at the step response of the discrete time ideal lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,64,0,0,599.100,11,12,signalprocessing,let's look at the step response of the continuous time ideal lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,74,0,0,710.430,10,10,signalprocessing,where instead of a very rapid transition from passband to stopband there would be a more gradual transition with a passband cutoff frequency and a stopband cutoff frequency , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,75,0,0,726.960,12,12,signalprocessing,and perhaps also instead of having an exactly flat characteristic in the stopband in the passband we would allow a certain amount of ripple , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,78,0,0,751.920,16,16,signalprocessing,again we would think in terms of an allowable passband ripple a transition from passband to stopband with a passband cutoff frequency and a stopband cutoff frequency , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,84,0,0,821.790,21,22,signalprocessing,now just to illustrate as an example let me remind you of one example of what in fact is a nonideal lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,98,0,0,981.430,16,17,signalprocessing,and as you can see and as we saw last time is an approximation to a lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,99,0,0,987.630,17,18,signalprocessing,it is in fact and nonideal lowpass filter whereas the resistor output is an approximation to a highpass filter or in effect a nonideal highpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,100,0,0,1002.200,24,25,signalprocessing,so in one case just comparing the two we have a lowpass filter as the capacitor output associated with the capacitor output and a highpass filter associated with the resistor output , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,107,0,0,1085.550,13,14,signalprocessing,and if we consider either one of these looking back again at the lowpass filter if we were to cascade several filters with this frequency response then because we have things plotted on a bode plot the bode plot for the cascade would simply be summing these , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,120,0,0,1220.380,13,14,signalprocessing,what's referred to as a graphic equalizer which consists of a set of bandpass filters which i'll describe a little more carefully in a minute , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,123,0,0,1251.380,8,9,signalprocessing,well what we have is a set of bandpass filters , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,137,0,0,1338.430,9,10,signalprocessing,and so now what we have effectively is a lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,138,0,0,1343.940,4,5,signalprocessing,and now with the lowpass filter let me now bring the highs back up , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,139,0,0,1351.180,6,7,signalprocessing,and so i'm bringing up those bandpass filters , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,149,0,0,1409.100,6,7,signalprocessing,it has a set of three bandpass filters and knobs which let us either put in up to twelve db gain or twelve db attenuation in each of the bands and also a selector switch that lets us select the center the band , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,152,0,0,1434.100,9,10,signalprocessing,so what we have as i indicated is three bandpass filters , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,162,0,0,1489.660,5,6,signalprocessing,and this switch is a highpass filter that essentially cuts out frequencies below about one hundred cycles , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,211,0,0,1872.300,11,12,signalprocessing,and as you can see that is some approximation to a lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,212,0,0,1878.860,14,15,signalprocessing,and so this again is the impulse response and frequency response of a nonideal lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,220,0,0,1951.970,5,5,signalprocessing,and here we have to stopband which in fact is down somewhat more than eighty db and again has what's referred to as an equal ripple characteristic , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,260,0,0,2336.990,21,22,signalprocessing,and recall that depending on whether the factor a is positive or negative we either get a lowpass filter or a highpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,261,0,0,2347.840,26,27,signalprocessing,and if in fact we look at the frequency response for the factor a being positive then we see that this is an approximation to a lowpass filter whereas below it i show the frequency response for a negative , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,262,0,0,2366.390,6,7,signalprocessing,and there this corresponds to a highpass filter because we're attenuating low frequencies and retaining the high frequencies , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,263,0,0,2379.350,12,13,signalprocessing,and recall also that we illustrated this characteristic as a lowpass or highpass filter for the first order recursion by looking at how it worked as a filter in both cases when the input was the dow jones average , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,162,0,0,1766.800,32,32,signalprocessing,and in addition to observing the frequency response let's also listen to the output sinusoid and observe the attenuation in the output as we go from the filter passband to the filter stopband , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,164,0,0,1793.290,7,7,signalprocessing,now of course we're in the filter stopband ]

Concept = BF46
Keyword = [Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,74,0,0,710.430,21,22,signalprocessing,where instead of a very rapid transition from passband to stopband there would be a more gradual transition with a passband cutoff frequency and a stopband cutoff frequency , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,78,0,0,751.920,20,21,signalprocessing,again we would think in terms of an allowable passband ripple a transition from passband to stopband with a passband cutoff frequency and a stopband cutoff frequency , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,72,1,0,854.690,3,4,signalprocessing,i picked the cutoff frequency of the low pass filter at half the sampling frequency namely five kilohertz , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,112,1,0,1223.600,8,9,signalprocessing,and so the low pass filter has a cutoff frequency as i indicate here of five kilohertz , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,59,0,0,728.250,21,22,signalprocessing,and again it's not the shape that's important to the discussion but the fact for example that it has a particular cutoff frequency which we will track as we work through this , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,67,0,0,792.080,56,57,signalprocessing,in particular we're dividing the frequency axis by capital t whereas this point in y of omega was two pi now it's two pi over capital t what that means is that equivalently we're multiplying this spectrum by the frequency response of the digital filter but now linearly scaled in frequency so that what was a cutoff frequency of omega sub c is now cutoff frequency of omega sub c divided by capital t , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,82,0,0,985.840,9,10,signalprocessing,and note that where the digital filter has a cutoff frequency of omega sub c the continuous time filter has a cutoff frequency of omega sub c divided by capital t , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,90,0,0,1098.800,2,3,signalprocessing,and the cutoff frequency of that filter , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,91,0,0,1101.520,14,15,signalprocessing,as i indicate the filter was designed as a discreet time filter with a cutoff frequency of pi over five , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,93,0,0,1119.200,10,11,signalprocessing,and so in fact the digital or discreet time filter cutoff frequency is a ten th of two pi , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,95,0,0,1138.940,9,10,signalprocessing,and so the consequence of that is that the cutoff frequency really is going to be associated with a ten th of the sampling frequency , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,154,0,0,1703.320,22,23,signalprocessing,so what we'll observe as the input frequency increases is that the output sinusoid will have essentially constant amplitude up to the cutoff frequency of the filter and then approximately zero amplitude past , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,156,0,0,1726.580,5,6,signalprocessing,and there is the filter cutoff frequency , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,170,0,0,1865.070,13,14,signalprocessing,now an important observation is that with the digital or discreet time filter cutoff frequency fixed as i've indicated here and i remind you that what the cutoff frequency is is a ten th of two pi with that cutoff frequency fixed because of the normalization that we get as we come back to a continuous time filter in fact what we have is a cutoff frequency that is dependent on the sampling frequency or on the sampling period , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,172,0,0,1906.580,4,5,signalprocessing,filter or has a cutoff frequency which is a ten th of two pi the normalization as you recall is that two pi in discreet time frequency corresponds to omega sub s the sampling frequency in terms of continuous time frequency , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,173,0,0,1925.180,5,6,signalprocessing,the consequence is that this cutoff frequency in fact is one point ten of not two pi now because of the normalization it's one point ten of the sampling frequency , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,174,0,0,1940.180,19,20,signalprocessing,so consequently as we change the sampling frequency what will happen is that even with the discreet time filter cutoff fixed the cutoff frequency of the equivalent continuous time filter will change , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,184,0,0,2038.450,7,8,signalprocessing,and we know that the effective filter cutoff frequency is tied to the sampling frequency and for this particular filter corresponds to a ten th of the sampling frequency , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,185,0,0,2052.719,19,20,signalprocessing,consequently if we double the sampling frequency we should double the effective filter passband width or double the filter cutoff frequency , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,188,0,0,2074.690,7,8,signalprocessing,and we should observe that the filter cutoff frequency has now doubled out to four kilohertz , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,191,0,0,2092.730,4,5,signalprocessing,we should see the cutoff frequency cut in half , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,201,0,0,2154.610,15,16,signalprocessing,now let's conclude this demonstration of the effect of the sampling frequency on the filter cutoff frequency by carrying out some filtering on some live audio , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,204,0,0,2186.100,9,10,signalprocessing,and in each of those cases the effective filter cutoff frequency then is cut in half from four kilohertz to two kilohertz to one kilohertz and then to five hundred cycles , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,205,0,0,2197.080,13,14,signalprocessing,so let's begin with a forty kilohertz sampling frequency or an effective filter cutoff frequency of four kilohertz , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,201,0,0,2421.190,18,19,signalprocessing,so if this is the continuous time frequency response just simply an ideal low pass filter with a cutoff frequency of omega sub c then the frequency scaling operation would keep the same basic shape but linearly scale the frequency axis so that we now have omega sub c times t then the discrete time frequency response would be a superposition of these added together at multiples of two pi in discrete time frequency , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,246,0,0,3014.950,6,7,signalprocessing,that method is referred to the bilinear transformation which we will define and utilize next time , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,5,0,0,84.900,22,23,signalprocessing,and then following that we'll proceed on to discuss another very important and useful mapping or design procedure referred to as the bilinear transformation , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,14,0,0,164.820,18,19,signalprocessing,at a frequency equal to the parameter omega sub c up here which is referred to as the cutoff frequency the butterworth filter frequency response always goes through the same point namely zero point seven hundred seven , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,48,0,0,531.150,18,21,signalprocessing,so we're talking about now a discrete time filter that we want to design through impulse invariance from continuous time butterworth filters and we're going to get our design specifications in the context of having considered discrete time processing of continuous time signals where we will map from a continuous time signal to a sequence carry out the filtering with the discrete time filter that we're going to design , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,125,0,0,1516.460,8,9,signalprocessing,and that's procedure is referred to as the bilinear transformation , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,126,0,0,1524.430,1,2,signalprocessing,the bilinear transformation which i won't try to derive here in any detail is a mapping of continuous time filters to discrete time filters corresponding to taking the laplace transform variable s in the continuous time filter and replacing it by what is referred to as a bilinear function of z , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,130,0,0,1573.570,20,21,signalprocessing,and let me just say quickly and in passing that although we won't go through this the notion that the bilinear transformation can be tied to the concept of taking the differential equation for the continuous time filter converting it to an integral equation by integrating enough times on both sides and then converting that to a difference equation by approximating the integrals with the trapezoidal rule , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,131,0,0,1610.200,19,20,signalprocessing,and that in effect will correspond to mapping the continuous time filter to a discrete time filter with the bilinear transformation , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,137,0,0,1690.270,12,13,signalprocessing,and if we think more generally of the mapping represented by the bilinear transformation in the context of the s plane and the z plane it corresponds to mapping the j omega axis in the s plane to once around the unit circle in the z plane , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,146,0,0,1822.544,34,35,signalprocessing,all right now that means that there is a nonlinear distortion of the frequency axis if we were to take a continuous time filter and convert it to a discrete time filter with the bilinear transformation , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,150,0,0,1874.300,18,19,signalprocessing,so let's suppose that the continuous time frequency response looks as i've shown here with a pass band cutoff frequency and a stop band cutoff frequency , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,151,0,0,1887.900,15,16,signalprocessing,if this were mapped through the bilinear transformation to a discrete time filter then this cutoff frequency would fall over here which is related through this curve and this cutoff frequency the stop band edge would be here , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,155,0,0,1943.070,47,48,signalprocessing,the design procedure would then correspond to mapping those frequencies to the corresponding continuous time frequencies designing the continuous time filter to meet the specifications based on those critical frequencies then taking the continuous time design and mapping it back to a discrete time filter through the bilinear transformation , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,161,0,0,2029.780,8,9,signalprocessing,we now want to do it with the bilinear transformation applied to an appropriate butterworth design , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,172,0,0,2149.770,20,21,signalprocessing,and again we have the issue that if we want to meet or exceed the specifications we can't make the filter order lower we have to make it higher , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,173,0,0,2160.440,15,16,signalprocessing,and so we would make it instead of five point three we would make the filter order equal to six , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,178,0,0,2206.910,10,11,signalprocessing,and the result of doing that is to choose a filter order capital n equal to six and the parameter omega sub c in the butterworth filter is given by zero point seventy six thousand six hundred twenty two , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,179,0,0,2224.350,24,25,signalprocessing,all right so now we have the parameters for the continuous time butterworth filter which when mapped to the discrete time filter through the bilinear transformation will exceed our requirements in the pass band and just meet the stop band cutoff , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,185,0,0,2296.810,23,24,signalprocessing,and once we have the transfer function b of s we then map that to a discrete time filter by mapping through the bilinear transformation , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,194,0,0,2381.046,1,2,signalprocessing,the bilinear transformation design is now overlaid on top of it , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,196,0,0,2394.820,8,9,signalprocessing,and this one that i'm lifting is the bilinear transformation and this is impulse invariance , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,197,0,0,2403.870,26,27,signalprocessing,and notice in fact something very interesting which is that the filter that we obtained by mapping the butterworth filter to a digital filter through the bilinear transformation in fact falls off in frequency much more rapidly than the one that we got through impulse invariance , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,199,0,0,2434.190,15,16,signalprocessing,now one thought that might come to mind is well impulse invariance has aliasing the bilinear transformation doesn't have aliasing that must be a consequence of aliasing , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,202,0,0,2454.460,11,12,signalprocessing,the reason has to do with this nonlinear mapping in the bilinear transformation from the continuous time frequency to the discrete time frequency , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,207,0,0,2524.380,22,23,signalprocessing,ok now this was a fairly rapid trip through a number of issues in particular some of the issues associated with the bilinear transformation and also this issue of how you pick this parameter capital t and how it might be associated with a sampling frequency if you're doing discrete time processing of continuous time signals , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,210,0,0,2561.220,15,16,signalprocessing,one comment is that the two techniques that we've talked about impulse invariance and the bilinear transformation are the two techniques that are principally used when one thinks of mapping continuous time filters to discrete time filters for whatever application , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,213,0,0,2626.610,7,8,signalprocessing,on the other hand we have the bilinear transformation as a design procedure which totally avoids aliasing but has the disadvantage or difficulty that it represents a nonlinear mapping from the continuous time filter to the discrete time filter ]

Keyword = [Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,7,0,0,75.280,16,17,signalprocessing,the idea is that what we wanted to do was exploit the properties of linearity and time invariance for linear time invariant systems , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,89,0,0,977.860,19,20,signalprocessing,and as the lecture proceeds the specific properties that i want to get to are properties of linearity and time invariance , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,113,0,0,1186.680,17,18,signalprocessing,now kind of amazingly what we'll see again when we get to this issue of linearity and time invariance which are a class of systems that we'll focus in on somewhat amazingly it turns out that for that specific class of systems the overall system transformation is independent of the order in which the systems are cascaded , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,274,0,0,2729.680,24,25,signalprocessing,ok now finally i'd like to turn to two properties that we'll make considerable use of as the course goes on the properties of time invariance and linearity , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,275,0,0,2745.210,0,1,signalprocessing,time invariance in essence says that the system doesn't really care what you call the origin , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,277,0,0,2767.630,10,11,signalprocessing,somewhat more formally as i've indicated here if in continuous time we have an input x t which generate an output y t then time invariance requires that if the input is shifted by any amount of time the output is shifted by the same amount of time , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,285,0,0,2830.590,25,26,signalprocessing,the best way to establish that is to work through the equations and verify that it either does or doesn't satisfy the formal definition of time invariance , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,289,0,0,2871.730,8,9,signalprocessing,but more generally if you're trying to test time invariance it's important to return to the definition , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,318,0,0,3149.550,10,11,signalprocessing,what we'll see is that the properties of linearity and time invariance in particular become central and important properties , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,77.810,24,25,signalprocessing,the issue of whether a system is or isn't invertible we talked about causality and stability and finally we talked about when linearity and time invariance , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,7,0,0,91.170,14,15,signalprocessing,in today's lecture what i'd like to do is focus specifically on linearity and time invariance and show how for systems that have those properties we can exploit them to generate a general representation , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,0,0,112.700,0,1,signalprocessing,time invariance as you recall is a property that applied both to continuous time and discrete time systems and in essence stated that for any given input and output relationship if we simply shift the input then the output shifts by the same amount , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,142.590,1,2,signalprocessing,so time invariance was a property that said that the system didn't care about what the time origin of the signal is , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,14,0,0,199.600,13,14,signalprocessing,now the question is how can we exploit the properties of linearity and time invariance , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,99,0,0,1195.240,13,14,signalprocessing,what we've managed to accomplish is to exploit the properties of linearity and time invariance so that the system could be represented in terms only of its response to an impulse at time zero , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,165,0,0,1571.280,17,18,signalprocessing,we could do it either by using convolution which would of course be associated with linearity and time invariance , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,93,0,0,1019.290,30,31,signalprocessing,okay so what we've seen then is the impulse response for a system described by a linear constant coefficient differential equation where in addition we would impose causality linearity and time invariance essentially through the initial conditions of initial rest , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,157,0,0,1637.400,6,7,signalprocessing,now we imposed causality linearity and time invariance and generated a solution recursively , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,169,0,0,1772.010,6,7,signalprocessing,if we impose causality linearity and time invariance on the system then of course that additional exponential factor will be zero , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,171,0,0,1788.970,28,29,signalprocessing,now we've seen the differential equations and difference equations in terms of the fact that there are families of solutions and in order to get causality linearity and time invariance requires imposing a particular set of initial conditions namely imposing initial rest on the system ]

Keyword = [Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,15,0,0,169.500,22,23,signalprocessing,and then in beginning the discussion of the fourier representation of continuous time signals we chose as another set of basic inputs complex exponentials , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,16,0,0,181.880,13,14,signalprocessing,so for continuous time we chose a set of basic inputs which were complex exponentials , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,17,0,0,190.380,8,9,signalprocessing,the motivation there was the fact that the complex exponentials have what we refer to as the eigenfunction property , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,18,0,0,200.940,4,5,signalprocessing,namely if we put complex exponentials into our continuous time systems then the output is a complex exponential of the same form with only a change in complex amplitude , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,21,0,0,246.170,13,14,signalprocessing,and the notion of decomposing a signal as a linear combination of these complex exponentials is what first the fourier series representation and then later the fourier transform representation corresponded to , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,22,0,0,262.680,31,32,signalprocessing,and finally to remind you of one additional point the fact is that because of the eigenfunction property the response once we have decomposed the input as a linear combination of complex exponentials the response to that linear combination is straightforward to compute once we know the frequency response because of the eigenfunction property , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,27,0,0,322.160,28,29,signalprocessing,well let's begin with the eigenfunction property and let me just state that just as in continuous time if we consider a set of basic signals which are complex exponential rules then discrete time linear time m invariant systems have the eigenfunction property , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,28,0,0,345.390,5,6,signalprocessing,namely if we put a complex exponential into the system , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,29,0,0,350.200,4,5,signalprocessing,the response is a complex exponential at the same complex frequency and simply multiplied by an appropriate complex factor or constant , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,30,0,0,363.620,14,15,signalprocessing,and just as we did in continuous time we will be referring to this complex constant which is a function of course the frequency of the complex exponential input , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,35,0,0,418.330,20,21,signalprocessing,now just as we did in continuous time let's begin the discussion by first concentrating on periodic the representation through complex exponentials of periodic sequences and then we'll generalize that discussion to the representation of aperiodic signals , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,38,0,0,459.610,26,27,signalprocessing,now we can consider exponentials which have this as a fundamental frequency or which are harmonics of that and that would correspond to the class of complex exponentials of the form e to the jk omega zero n , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,39,0,0,479.290,2,3,signalprocessing,so these complex exponentials then as k varies are complex exponentials that are harmonically related all of which are periodic with the same period capital n , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,43,0,0,516.780,14,15,signalprocessing,and so we consider a periodic signal which is a weighted sum of these complex exponentials , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,48,0,0,553.860,23,24,signalprocessing,however before we do that let me focus on an important distinction between continuous time and discrete time in the context of these complex exponentials and this representation , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,49,0,0,570.420,4,5,signalprocessing,when we talked about complex exponentials and sinusoids early in the course one of the differences that we saw between continuous time and discrete time is that in continuous time as we vary the frequency variable we see different complex exponentials as omega varies , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,51,0,0,597.750,16,17,signalprocessing,or said another way it's straightforward to verify that if we think of this class of complex exponentials , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,52,0,0,608.880,23,24,signalprocessing,that in fact if we consider varying k by adding to it capital n where capital n is the period of the fundamental complex exponential , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,53,0,0,625.690,17,18,signalprocessing,then in fact if we replace k by k plus capital n we'll see exactly the same complex exponentials over again , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,55,0,0,639.690,11,12,signalprocessing,what it says is that if i consider this class of complex exponentials as k varies from zero through capital n minus one we will see all of the ones that there are to see , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,58,0,0,676.230,8,9,signalprocessing,because beyond that we'll simply see the same complex exponentials over again , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,59,0,0,682.870,17,18,signalprocessing,so for example if k takes on the value capital n that will be exactly the same complex exponential as if k is equal to zero , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,60,0,0,694.300,13,14,signalprocessing,so in fact this sum ranges only over capital n of the distinct complex exponentials , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,62,0,0,707.100,5,6,signalprocessing,although in fact since these complex exponentials repeat in k i could actually consider instead of from zero to n minus one i could consider from one to n or from two to n plus one or whatever , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,63,0,0,723.800,31,32,signalprocessing,or said another way in this representation i could alternatively choose k outside this range thinking of these coefficients simply as periodically repeating in k because of the fact that these complex exponentials periodically repeat in k , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,88,0,0,961.960,17,18,signalprocessing,and the difference arises to a large extent because of this notion that in discrete time the complex exponentials are periodic in their frequency , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,91,0,0,992.250,4,5,signalprocessing,and of course the complex exponentials involved are periodic , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,112,0,0,1214.430,14,15,signalprocessing,now for this particular example we can expand this out directly in terms of complex exponentials and essentially recognize this as a sum of complex exponentials , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,150,0,0,1566.140,37,38,signalprocessing,and recall also that this was essentially the trick that we used in continuous time to allow us to develop or utilize the fourier series to provide a representation of aperiodic signals as a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,209,0,0,2043.820,19,20,signalprocessing,once again the reason for the periodicity it all stems back to the fact that when we talk about complex exponentials and recall back to the early lectures , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,210,0,0,2055.199,24,25,signalprocessing,in discrete time as the frequency variable covers a range of two pi when you proceed past that range you simply see the same complex exponentials over and over again , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,282,0,0,2843.884,28,29,signalprocessing,ok so to summarize what we've done is to pretty much parallel somewhat more quickly the kind of development that we went through for continuous time representation through complex exponentials paralleled that for the discrete time case , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,288,0,0,2915.120,11,12,signalprocessing,the other very important difference tied back to the difference between complex exponentials continuous time and discrete time , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,289,0,0,2923.050,3,4,signalprocessing,in continuous time complex exponentials as you vary the frequency generate distinct time functions , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,12,0,0,122.890,25,26,signalprocessing,and i draw your attention again to the basic point that the synthesis equation essentially corresponds to decomposing the sequence as a linear combination of complex exponentials with amplitudes that are in effect proportional to the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,18,0,0,208.580,20,21,signalprocessing,and i stress again that the underlying basis for this periodicity property is the fact that it's the set of complex exponentials that are inherently periodic in frequency , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,45,0,0,473.050,31,32,signalprocessing,there also is a dual to the time shifting property which is referred to as the frequency shifting property which tells us that if we multiply a time function by a complex exponential that in effect generates a frequency shift , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,61,0,0,665.120,35,36,signalprocessing,now we also saw and have talked about a relationship between the fourier transform the impulse response and what we call the frequency response in the context of the response of a system to a complex exponential , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,62,0,0,685.840,1,2,signalprocessing,specifically complex exponentials are eigenfunctions of linear time invariant systems , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,63,0,0,693.210,12,13,signalprocessing,one of these into the system gives us as an output a complex exponential with the same complex frequency multiplied by what we refer to as the eigenvalue , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,71,0,0,783.330,22,23,signalprocessing,specifically the argument was that the fourier transform of a sequence or signal corresponds to decomposing it into a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,72,0,0,798.330,5,6,signalprocessing,what's the amplitude of those complex exponentials , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,74,0,0,805.990,15,16,signalprocessing,if we think of pushing through the system that linear combination then each of those complex exponentials gets the amplitude modified or multiplied by the fourier transform of by the frequency response which we saw is the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,75,0,0,829.130,6,7,signalprocessing,so the amplitudes of the output complex exponentials is then the amplitudes of the input complex exponentials multiplied by the frequency response , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,77,0,0,859.580,41,42,signalprocessing,so it's important in thinking about the convolution property to think about it in terms of nothing more than the fact that we've decomposed the input and we're now modifying separately through multiplication through scaling the amplitudes of each of the complex exponential components , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,79,0,0,900.640,15,16,signalprocessing,kind of the idea that if we decompose the input as a linear combination of complex exponentials we can separately attenuate or amplify each of those components , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,90,0,0,1006.030,13,14,signalprocessing,although it's important to recognize that because of the inherent periodicity of the complex exponentials these frequencies are exactly the same frequencies as these frequencies , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,96,0,0,1054.800,3,4,signalprocessing,and once our complex exponentials go past pi then in fact we start seeing the lower frequencies again , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,259,0,0,2757.240,20,21,signalprocessing,in the continuous time fourier series we have a periodic time function expanded as a linear combination of harmonically related complex exponentials , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,265,0,0,2831.830,29,30,signalprocessing,and we now have a continuous time function which is no longer periodic this was for the aperiodic case represented as a linear combination of infinitesimally close in frequency complex exponentials with complex amplitudes given by x of omega d omega divided by two pi , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,270,0,0,2899.560,10,11,signalprocessing,corresponding to representing a periodic sequence through a set of complex exponentials where now we only required a finite number of these because of the fact that in fact there are only a finite number of harmonically related complex exponentials , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,271,0,0,2918.580,7,8,signalprocessing,that's an inherent property of discrete time complex exponentials , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,274,0,0,2933.270,21,22,signalprocessing,which of course are discrete as fourier series coefficients are and which periodically repeat because of the fact that the associated complex exponentials periodically repeat , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,278,0,0,3001.500,37,38,signalprocessing,and so the important difference between the continuous time and discrete time case kind of arose in part out of the fact that discrete time is discrete time continuous time is continuous time and the fact that complex exponentials are periodic in discrete time , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,156.370,16,17,signalprocessing,now recall also that in developing the fourier transform i interpreted the fourier transform as the complex amplitude of a decomposition of the signal in terms of a set of complex exponentials , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,12,0,0,172.120,21,22,signalprocessing,and the frequency response or the convolution property in effect tells us how to modify the amplitudes of each of those complex exponentials as they go through the system , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,13,0,0,185.320,24,25,signalprocessing,now this led to the notion of filtering where the basic concept was that since we can modify the amplitudes of each of the complex exponential components separately we can for example retain some of them and totally eliminate others , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,40,0,0,454.050,13,14,signalprocessing,in today's lecture what i'll focus on is first the case of a complex exponential carrier second the case of sinusoidal carrier , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,41,0,0,465.210,4,5,signalprocessing,and in fact the complex exponential carrier and sinusoidal carrier are obviously very closely related since the complex exponential carrier is in effect two sinusoidal carriers , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,43,0,0,484.900,12,13,signalprocessing,so let's first begin the discussion of amplitude modulation by considering a complex exponential carrier and then moving on to a discussion of a sinusoidal carrier , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,53,0,0,565.760,9,10,signalprocessing,and then the carrier signal since it's a single complex exponential has a fourier transform which is an impulse in the frequency domain , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,58,0,0,618.660,21,22,signalprocessing,so what this says is that if we have a signal x of t and we use it to modulate a complex exponential carrier in the frequency domain what we've simply done is to take the original spectrum and shift it in frequency , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,77,0,0,766.920,32,33,signalprocessing,now one question that you could conceivably be asking is if we're talking about practical systems and not simply mathematics does it make sense in the real world to consider using a complex exponential carrier , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,79,0,0,791.300,16,17,signalprocessing,that very often in practical systems one considers using a carrier which in fact is a complex exponential , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,80,0,0,800.640,2,3,signalprocessing,well a complex exponential is complex , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,109,0,0,999.660,15,16,signalprocessing,which is an application that in fact surfaces fairly often in the context of a complex exponential carrier , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,117,0,0,1067.860,6,7,signalprocessing,and we modulate it with a complex exponential carrier with a carrier frequency omega c , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,142,0,0,1320.600,9,10,signalprocessing,so we've worked our way through modulation with a complex exponential carrier , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,143,0,0,1328.350,9,10,signalprocessing,and what we saw among other things with a complex exponential carrier is that what it corresponds to is two branches , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,146,0,0,1354.340,3,4,signalprocessing,modulation of the complex exponential carrier really would be accomplished with modulation with a sinusoidal carrier and in particular with sinusoidal carriers that are in quadrature as it's referred to or equivalently ninety degrees out of phase , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,148,0,0,1380.750,19,20,signalprocessing,modulation using only a sinusoidal carrier very often is used in its own right not only for generating a complex exponential carrier but as a carrier by itself , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,152,0,0,1422.920,12,13,signalprocessing,and of course we can write that as the sum of two complex exponential signals , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,165,0,0,1529.500,6,7,signalprocessing,now in the case of a complex exponential that was easy to do , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,190,0,0,1703.140,15,16,signalprocessing,and just to summarize for the case of a sinusoidal carrier as opposed to a complex exponential carrier the modulator is just as it is in the complex exponential case , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,321,0,0,2904.470,5,6,signalprocessing,that's of course what the complex exponential carrier did , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,352,0,0,3185.000,20,21,signalprocessing,and as we'll see the next lecture very much the same kinds of notions apply for discrete time sinusoidal and complex exponential amplitude modulation , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,69.950,13,14,signalprocessing,we talked about the properties and analysis of modulation when we had a complex exponential carrier signal , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,111.920,9,10,signalprocessing,one is a parallel discussion particularly as associated with complex exponential and sinusoidal modulation for discrete time signals , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,20,0,0,238.860,7,8,signalprocessing,what we'll focus on is first a complex exponential carrier and second a sinusoidal carrier , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,23,0,0,270.280,4,5,signalprocessing,so let's first consider complex exponential and sinusoidal carriers for the discrete time case emphasizing the very strong parallel and similarity between discrete time and continuous time , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,27,0,0,309.480,10,11,signalprocessing,and since we want to consider first of all a complex exponential carrier we'll consider the case of c of n equal to e to the j omega sub cn , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,36,0,0,388.170,7,8,signalprocessing,so the result of modulation with a complex exponential is a straightforward shift of the spectrum so that what occurred around zero frequency now occurs around the frequency omega sub c , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,37,0,0,407.040,12,13,signalprocessing,now in the continuous time case we demodulated when we had a complex exponential carrier we demodulated by essentially just shifting the spectrum back , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,40,0,0,469.460,10,11,signalprocessing,so what's happened in the discrete time case with the complex exponential is exactly the same as in continuous time , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,47,0,0,517.460,14,15,signalprocessing,so in this case now rather than a carrier signal which is a single complex exponential it's now a sinusoidal carrier and the sinusoidal carrier is the sum of two complex exponential , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,48,0,0,532.320,39,40,signalprocessing,and so if we consider a modulated spectrum that is the spectrum of x of n something of the type that i indicate here and the spectrum of the carrier now since the carrier is sinusoidal rather than a complex exponential consists of two impulses one at plus omega sub c and one at minus omega sub c convolving this spectrum with this spectrum gives us a replication of x of omega around plus and minus omega sub c , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,66,0,0,843.490,22,23,signalprocessing,another very important reason and it's important to stress this at the outset is that whereas the theory involving the use of complex exponential and sinusoidal modulation parallels very strongly in the continuous time and the discrete time case , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,73,0,0,973.110,24,25,signalprocessing,ok now there is another application that we have discussed for both continuous time and actually previously for discrete time amplitude modulation with sinusoidal complex exponential carriers , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,77,0,0,1025.579,25,26,signalprocessing,and the notion was that if we modulate the signal with a carrier which is minus one to the n and that's just simply a complex exponential or sinusoidal carrier with a carrier frequency of pi then that in effect interchanges the low frequencies and the high frequencies , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,89,0,0,1259.130,22,23,signalprocessing,ok well so what we've done so far for continuous time and discrete time is to talk about modulation amplitude modulation with complex exponential and sinusoidal carriers , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,13,0,0,153.060,10,11,signalprocessing,the basic signals that we picked in the representation were complex exponentials , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,14,0,0,158.800,35,36,signalprocessing,and in what we had referred to as the synthesis equation the synthesis equation corresponded to in effect a decomposition as a linear combination a decomposition of x of t as a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,15,0,0,176.980,21,22,signalprocessing,and of course associated with this was the corresponding analysis equation that in effect gave us the amplitudes associated with the complex exponentials , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,16,0,0,188.850,5,6,signalprocessing,now why did we pick complex exponentials , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,17,0,0,191.550,7,8,signalprocessing,well recall that the reason was that complex exponentials are eigenfunctions of linear time invariant systems and that was very convenient , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,18,0,0,201.900,35,36,signalprocessing,specifically if we have a linear time invariant system with an impulse response h of t what we had shown is that that class of systems has the property that if we put in a complex exponential we get out a complex exponential at the same frequency and with a change in amplitude , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,20,0,0,240.380,7,8,signalprocessing,so the notion of decomposing signals into complex exponentials was very intimately connected and the fourier transform was very intimately connected with the eigenfunction property of complex exponentials for linear time invariant systems , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,21,0,0,260.070,1,2,signalprocessing,well complex exponentials of that type are not the only eigenfunctions for linear time invariant systems , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,24,0,0,285.670,6,7,signalprocessing,for any value of s the complex exponential is an eigenfunction , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,26,0,0,297.040,7,8,signalprocessing,in other words the response to this complex exponential is the convolution of the impulse response with the excitation , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,31,0,0,335.040,14,15,signalprocessing,so just simply carrying through the algebra what we would conclude is that a complex exponential with any complex number s would generate as an output a complex exponential of the same form multiplied by whatever this integral is , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,36,0,0,390.340,17,18,signalprocessing,so what we have then is the eigenfunction property more generally in terms of a more general complex exponential where the complex factor is given by this integral , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,45,0,0,504.140,6,7,signalprocessing,and rather than pushing just a complex exponential through the system we've pushed a more general time function e to the st where s is a complex number with both a real part and an imaginary part , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,84.380,24,25,signalprocessing,now just as in continuous time in discrete time the fourier transform corresponded to a representation of a sequence as a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,115.310,5,6,signalprocessing,the reason that we picked complex exponentials was because of the fact that they are eigenfunctions of linear time invariant systems , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,124.730,7,8,signalprocessing,in other words if you have a complex exponential into a linear time invariant system the output is a complex exponential , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,15,0,0,164.680,16,17,signalprocessing,and just as in continuous time there are a set of signals more general than the complex exponentials which are also eigenfunctions of linear time invariant systems , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,23,0,0,280.530,10,11,signalprocessing,so for a linear time invariant system a more general complex exponential sequence of this form generates as an output a complex exponential sequence of the same form with a change in amplitude which we're representing as h of z recognizing the fact that it's going to be a function of what that complex number is , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,28,0,0,335.790,9,10,signalprocessing,and what we've simply done is to expand from complex exponentials with a purely imaginary exponent complex exponential time functions or sequences of that form to ones that have more general complex exponential factors , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,183,0,0,2208.200,57,58,signalprocessing,if we expand this in a partial fraction expansion and we look at the impulse response associated with this we know how to take the inverse of laplace transform of this where i'm just naturally assuming causality throughout the discussion the continuous time impulse response then is the sum of exponentials with these amplitudes and at these complex exponential frequencies , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,187,0,0,1746.820,12,13,signalprocessing,these relate strongly to sinusoidal signals namely the class of real and complex exponentials , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,191,0,0,1783.900,4,5,signalprocessing,shortly we'll also consider complex exponentials where these numbers can then become complex , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,230,0,0,2097.960,7,8,signalprocessing,now let's look at the continuous time complex exponential , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,231,0,0,2103.130,6,7,signalprocessing,and what i mean by a complex exponential again is an exponential of the form c e a t , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,255,0,0,2299.350,7,8,signalprocessing,in particular we'll make reference to our complex exponentials in the discrete time case , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,256,0,0,2308.860,4,5,signalprocessing,the expression for the complex exponential looks very much like the expression for the real exponential except that now we have complex factors , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,277,0,0,2477.620,8,9,signalprocessing,now one can ask whether in general the complex exponential with the magnitude of alpha equal to one is periodic or not periodic , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,281,0,0,2519.570,10,11,signalprocessing,in a continuous time case when we have a pure complex exponential so that the terms aren't exponentially growing or decaying those exponentials are always periodic , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,287,0,0,2578.000,6,7,signalprocessing,in particular sinusoids and real and complex exponentials , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,290,0,0,2596.700,10,11,signalprocessing,and these differences will surface when we exploit sinusoids and complex exponentials as basic building blocks for more general continuous time and discrete time signals , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,3,0,0,59.745,10,11,signalprocessing,in the last lecture we discussed sinusoidal and real and complex exponential signals both for continuous time and discrete time , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,24,0,0,285.840,8,9,signalprocessing,the second is a decomposition of inputs into complex exponentials a linear combination of complex exponentials and that leads to a representation of signals and systems through what we'll refer to as fourier analysis , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,29,0,0,358.030,9,10,signalprocessing,and it typically consists of a sum of n complex exponentials , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,31,0,0,374.000,29,30,signalprocessing,and this form for the homogeneous solution in essence drops out of examining the homogeneous equation where if we assume that the form of the homogeneous solution is a complex exponential with some unspecified amplitude and unspecified exponent , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,37,0,0,438.160,8,9,signalprocessing,namely it consists of a sum of n complex exponentials where the coefficients the n coefficients attach to each of those complex exponential is undetermined or unspecified , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,59,0,0,687.180,9,10,signalprocessing,the homogeneous solution is an amplitude factor times a complex exponential , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,61,0,0,700.860,18,19,signalprocessing,what you can see is that in this equation i can cancel out the amplitude factor and this complex exponential , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,18,0,0,236.120,30,31,signalprocessing,and in particular the signals that we'll be using as the building blocks for our more general signals rather than impulses as we've dealt with before will be in general complex exponentials , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,19,0,0,252.230,26,27,signalprocessing,so in a general sense in the continuous time case we'll be thinking in terms of a decomposition of our signals as a linear combination of complex exponentials continuous time or in the discrete time case complex exponentials where z k is complex here in discrete time and s sub k is complex here in continuous time , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,23,0,0,309.290,4,5,signalprocessing,what we'll find with complex exponentials either continuous time or discrete time is that they very nicely have those two properties , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,24,0,0,317.870,29,30,signalprocessing,in particular the notion that the output of a linear time invariant system is easy to compute is tied to what's referred to as the eigenfunction function property of complex exponentials which we'll focus on shortly in a little more detail , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,27,0,0,357.860,17,18,signalprocessing,now in doing this although we could in fact begin with our attention focused on in general complex exponentials what we'll choose to do is first focus on the case in which the exponent in the continuous time case is purely imaginary as i indicate here and in the discrete time case where the magnitude of the complex number z k is equal to one , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,33,0,0,439.210,9,10,signalprocessing,so for now we want to restrict ourselves to complex exponentials of a particular form and in fact also initially to continuous time signals and systems , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,34,0,0,450.980,10,11,signalprocessing,so let's begin with the continuous time case and the complex exponentials that we want to deal with and focus first of all on what i refer to as the eigenfunction property of this particular set of building blocks , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,37,0,0,496.020,20,21,signalprocessing,now more or less the justification for this or the proof follows by simply looking at the response to a complex exponential using the convolution integral , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,38,0,0,508.140,5,6,signalprocessing,so if we put a complex exponentials into a linear time invariant system with impulse response h t then we can express the response as i've indicated here , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,39,0,0,522.780,6,7,signalprocessing,we can then recognize that this complex exponentials can be factored into two terms , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,40,0,0,528.680,6,7,signalprocessing,and so we can rewrite this complex exponential as this product , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,42,0,0,550.360,15,16,signalprocessing,and so what we're left with when we track this through is that with a complex exponential input we get an output which is the same complex exponential namely this factor times this integral , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,44,0,0,577.040,8,9,signalprocessing,and so in fact we put in a complex exponential we get out a complex exponentials of the same frequency multiplied by a complex constant , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,49,0,0,627.540,9,10,signalprocessing,ok now it's because of the eigenfunction property that complex exponentials are particularly convenient as building blocks , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,52,0,0,661.030,11,12,signalprocessing,and in fact that turns out to be the case with complex exponentials , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,56,0,0,689.770,11,12,signalprocessing,and the representation that's developed in terms of linear combinations of complex exponentials is what's referred to as the fourier transform , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,65,0,0,759.640,6,7,signalprocessing,now let's examine first of all complex exponentials and recognize first of all that there is a complex exponential that has exactly the same period and fundamental frequency as our more general periodic signal namely the complex exponential e j omega zero t where omega zero is two pi t zero or equivalently t zero is two pi omega zero , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,66,0,0,792.640,3,4,signalprocessing,now that's the complex exponential which has t zero as the fundamental period , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,67,0,0,799.760,5,6,signalprocessing,but there are harmonically related complex exponentials that also have t zero as a period although in fact their fundamental period is shorter , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,68,0,0,812.520,6,7,signalprocessing,so we can also look at complex exponentials of the form e j k omega zero t , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,72,0,0,838.520,11,12,signalprocessing,so as k an integer varies these correspond to harmonically related complex exponentials , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,73,0,0,849.140,57,58,signalprocessing,now what the fourier series says and we'll justify this bit by bit as the discussion goes on what the fourier series says and in fact what fourier said which was essentially his brilliant insight is that if i have a very general periodic signal i can represent it as a linear combination of these harmonically related complex exponentials , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,82,0,0,935.430,17,18,signalprocessing,this representation of the fourier series which i've repeated again here is what's referred to as the complex exponential form of the fourier series , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,85,0,0,976.700,2,3,signalprocessing,now that complex exponential form is one representation for the fourier series , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,89,0,0,1007.240,10,11,signalprocessing,essentially we can get to the trigonometric form from the complex exponential form by recognizing that if we express the complex coefficient in polar form or in rectangular form and expand the complex exponential term out in terms of cosine plus j sine using just simply euler's relation then we will end up with a representation for the periodic signal or a re expression of the fourier series expression that we had previously either in the form that i indicate here where now the periodic signal is expressed in terms of a summation of cosines with appropriate amplitude and phase , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,93,0,0,1096.590,6,7,signalprocessing,however let's look back and the complex exponential form for the fourier series at the top of the board , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,95,0,0,1118.700,12,13,signalprocessing,so the representation that we will most typically be using is the complex exponential form , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,102,0,0,1184.660,14,15,signalprocessing,but essentially the algebra develops out of the recognition that if we integrate a complex exponential over one period t zero and i mean by this notation that this is an integral over a period where i don't particularly care where the period starts and where the period stops in other words exactly what period i picked that this integral is equal to t zero when m is equal to zero , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,109,0,0,1282.310,62,63,signalprocessing,if we multiply both sides of that by e j n omega zero t and integrate that over a period both sides of the equation integrated over a period so these two equations are equal and then in essence interchange the summation and the integration so that this part of the expression comes outside the sum and then we combine these two complex exponentials together where we come out is the expression that i've indicated here , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,118,0,0,1414.260,24,25,signalprocessing,what i'll refer to as the fourier series synthesis equation is the equation that tells us how to build x t out of these complex exponentials , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,191,0,0,2043.480,20,21,signalprocessing,so here we have the expression which is the synthesis equation telling us how x t could be represented as complex exponentials if it can be , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,288,0,0,2957.560,15,16,signalprocessing,we more broadly want to have a more general representation of signals in terms of complex exponentials , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,292,0,0,2992.810,20,21,signalprocessing,the basic strategy with an aperiodic signal is to think of representing this aperiodic signal as a linear combination of complex exponentials by the simple trick of periodically replicating this signal generating a periodic signal using a fourier series representation for that periodic signal and then simply letting the period go to infinity , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,3,0,0,56.260,19,20,signalprocessing,last time we began to address the issue of building continuous time signals out of a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,79.110,24,25,signalprocessing,for periodic signals we had the continuous time fourier series where we built the periodic signal out of a linear combination of harmonically related complex exponentials , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,12,0,0,149.470,26,27,signalprocessing,now what we'd like to do is extend this idea to provide a mechanism for building non periodic signals also out of a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,25,0,0,284.220,24,25,signalprocessing,the fourier series synthesis expression for the periodic signal expresses x tilde of t the periodic signal as a linear combination of harmonically related complex exponentials with the fundamental frequency omega zero equaled to two pi divided by the period , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,49,0,0,589.930,29,30,signalprocessing,so we now have an analysis equation and a synthesis equation which in effect expresses for us how to build x of t in terms of infinitesimally finely spaced complex exponentials , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,105,0,0,1188.160,22,23,signalprocessing,and the reason you should recall and keep in mind is related to the fact that we're building our signals out of complex exponentials which require both positive values of omega and negative values of omega , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,3,0,0,55.600,20,21,signalprocessing,in the last two lectures we saw how periodic and non periodic signals could be represented as linear combinations of complex exponentials , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,0,0,105.350,23,24,signalprocessing,the synthesis equation being an equation the tells us how to build the time function out of in essence a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,0,0,117.060,13,14,signalprocessing,and the analysis equation telling us how to get the amplitudes of those complex exponentials from the associated time function , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,127.970,14,15,signalprocessing,so essentially in the decomposition of x of t as a linear combination of complex exponentials the complex amplitudes of those are in effect the fourier transform scaled by the differential and scaled by one over two pi , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,28,0,0,294.050,10,11,signalprocessing,so in fact although i stressed last time that the complex exponentials is required to build a time function require exponentials of both positive and negative frequencies for x of t real what we see is that because of these symmetry properties either for the real and imaginary or magnitude and angle we can specify the fourier transform for let's say only positive frequencies , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,128,0,0,1528.840,11,12,signalprocessing,recall that one of the things that led us to use complex exponentials as building blocks was the fact that they're eigenfunctions of linear time and variant systems , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,130,0,0,1545.640,8,9,signalprocessing,and i have an input which is a complex exponential the output is a complex exponential of the same frequency multiplied by what we call the frequency response , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,134,0,0,1582.260,39,40,signalprocessing,well remember what i said at the beginning of the lecture when i pointed to the synthesis equation and i said in essence the synthesis equation tells us how to decompose x of t as a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,135,0,0,1600.740,3,4,signalprocessing,what are the complex amplitudes of those complex exponentials , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,136,0,0,1605.020,7,8,signalprocessing,in terms of our notation here the complex amplitude of those complex exponentials is x of omega or proportional to x of omega in particular it's x of omega d omega and then a factor of two pi , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,138,0,0,1638.090,8,9,signalprocessing,what comes out is the amplitude of the complex exponentials that are used to build the output , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,139,0,0,1648.610,22,23,signalprocessing,so in fact the convolution property simply is telling us that in terms of the decomposition of the signal in terms of complex exponentials as we push that signal through a linear time invariant system we're separately multiplying by the frequency response the amplitudes of the exponential components used to build the input ]

Concept = T3
Keyword = [Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,20,0,0,228.930,24,25,signalprocessing,and also by the way as it developed later that frequency response as you should now recognize from this expression is in fact the fourier transform the continuous time fourier transform of the system impulse response , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,21,0,0,246.170,19,20,signalprocessing,and the notion of decomposing a signal as a linear combination of these complex exponentials is what first the fourier series representation and then later the fourier transform representation corresponded to , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,33,0,0,398.340,14,15,signalprocessing,this particular expression in fact will correspond to what we'll refer to as the fourier transform the discrete time fourier transform of the system impulse response , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,186,0,0,1875.210,9,10,signalprocessing,and as n goes to infinity then what the fourier series becomes is the fourier transform as summarized by the bottom two equations , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,192,0,0,1919.890,9,10,signalprocessing,so what we have then is the discrete time fourier transform which is a representation of an aperiodic signal , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,195,0,0,1952.800,16,17,signalprocessing,and we have the corresponding analysis equation which is shown below where this tells us the fourier transform , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,202,0,0,2007.350,1,2,signalprocessing,it's fourier transform x of omega is a function of a continuous variable , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,212,0,0,2077.480,9,10,signalprocessing,all right notationally we'll again represent the discrete time fourier transform pair as i indicated here , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,218,0,0,2134.110,7,8,signalprocessing,as the period goes to infinity the fourier transform of this is represented by the envelope of those fourier series coefficients and that was our sin nx over sin x function which in this particular case for these particular numbers is sin five omega over two divided by sin omega over two , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,226,0,0,2214.670,6,7,signalprocessing,basically if we substitute into the fourier transform analysis equation it's this sum that we evaluate , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,232,0,0,2263.330,11,12,signalprocessing,and let's in particular focus on what the magnitude of the fourier transform looks like , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,236,0,0,2289.090,7,8,signalprocessing,and the periodicity is inherent in the fourier transform in discrete time so we really might only need to look at this either from minus pi to pi or from zero to two pi , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,243,0,0,2358.500,4,5,signalprocessing,now we developed the fourier transform by beginning with the fourier series , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,246,0,0,2372.920,4,5,signalprocessing,is now absorb the fourier series within the broader framework of the fourier transform , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,247,0,0,2381.540,7,8,signalprocessing,and there are two relationships between the fourier series and the fourier transform which are identical to relationships that we had in the continuous time case , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,248,0,0,2394.250,23,24,signalprocessing,let me remind you that in continuous time we had the statement that if we have a periodic signal that in fact the fourier series coefficients of that periodic signal is proportional to samples of the fourier transform of one period , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,249,0,0,2423.140,25,26,signalprocessing,well in fact let me remind you flows easily from all the things that we built up so far because of the fact that the fourier transform essentially by definition of the way we developed it is what we get as the fourier series coefficients as we focus on one period and then let the period go off to infinity , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,250,0,0,2451.050,6,7,signalprocessing,well looking at one period the fourier transform of that then is the envelope of the fourier series coefficients , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,254,0,0,2500.790,10,11,signalprocessing,if we have a periodic signal and we consider the fourier transform of one period the fourier series coefficients of this periodic signal are in fact samples as stated mathematically in the bottom equation samples of the fourier transform of one period , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,255,0,0,2527.340,6,7,signalprocessing,so x of omega is the fourier transform of one period , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,260,0,0,2565.690,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier transform of one period in fact represents the envelope , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,264,0,0,2588.390,11,12,signalprocessing,so what we have then is a relationship back to the fourier series coefficients from the fourier transform that tells us that for a periodic signal now the periodic signal the fourier series coefficients are related are samples of the fourier transform of one period , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,266,0,0,2627.310,9,10,signalprocessing,we can absorb it into the framework of the fourier transform , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,271,0,0,2664.360,19,20,signalprocessing,essentially what i pointed out at that time was that if we define take it as a definition the fourier transform of the periodic signal as an impulse train where the amplitudes of the impulses are proportional to the fourier series coefficients , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,272,0,0,2684.680,13,14,signalprocessing,if we take that impulse train representation and simply plug it into the fourier transform synthesis equation what we end up with is the fourier series synthesis equation , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,273,0,0,2704.860,13,14,signalprocessing,so in continuous time we had used this definition of the continuous time fourier transform of a periodic signal , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,276,0,0,2739.810,11,12,signalprocessing,so in discrete time if we have a periodic signal the fourier transform of that periodic signal is defined as an impulse train where the amplitudes of the impulses are proportional to the fourier series coefficients , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,277,0,0,2757.500,11,12,signalprocessing,if this expression is substituted into the synthesis equation for the fourier transform that will simply then reduce to the synthesis equation for the fourier series , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,281,0,0,2809.550,7,8,signalprocessing,and if instead of talking about the fourier series coefficients what i want to talk about is the fourier transform the fourier transform in essence corresponds to simply redrawing that using impulses and using an axis that is essentially indexed on the fundamental frequency omega zero rather than on the fourier series coefficient number k , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,287,0,0,2906.750,6,7,signalprocessing,whereas in continuous time for the fourier transform we had a duality between the time domain and frequency domain , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,295,0,0,2970.290,3,4,signalprocessing,again on the fourier transform the discrete time fourier transform develop or illuminate some of the properties of the fourier transform and then see how these properties can be used for a number of things , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,4,0,0,55.260,10,11,signalprocessing,last time we began the development of the discrete time fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,7,0,0,71.060,7,8,signalprocessing,and then we generalized that to the fourier transform and finally incorporated within the framework of the fourier transform both aperiodic and periodic signals , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,0,0,83.070,17,18,signalprocessing,in today's lecture what i'd like to do is expand on some of the properties of the fourier transform and indicate how those properties are used for a variety of things , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,0,0,94.770,6,7,signalprocessing,well let's begin by reviewing the fourier transform as we developed it last time , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,107.040,13,14,signalprocessing,the synthesis equation expressing x of n the sequence in terms of the fourier transform and the analysis equation telling us how to obtain the fourier transform from the original sequence , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,12,0,0,122.890,36,37,signalprocessing,and i draw your attention again to the basic point that the synthesis equation essentially corresponds to decomposing the sequence as a linear combination of complex exponentials with amplitudes that are in effect proportional to the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,13,0,0,145.820,4,5,signalprocessing,now the discrete time fourier transform just as the continuous time fourier transform has a number of important and useful properties , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,16,0,0,180.540,7,8,signalprocessing,also as i indicated last time the fourier transform is a periodic function of frequency and the periodicity is with a period of two pi , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,17,0,0,196.030,8,9,signalprocessing,and so it says in effect that the fourier transform if we replace the frequency variable by an integer multiple of two pi the function repeats , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,20,0,0,236.780,6,7,signalprocessing,just as in continuous time the fourier transform has important symmetry properties , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,21,0,0,243.560,14,15,signalprocessing,and in particular if the sequence x sub n is real valued then the fourier transform is conjugate symmetric , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,22,0,0,254.680,18,19,signalprocessing,in other words if we replace omega by minus omega that's equivalent to applying complex conjugation to the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,26,0,0,306.730,4,5,signalprocessing,and that is the fourier transform of a real damped exponential , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,28,0,0,323.590,6,7,signalprocessing,we saw last time that the fourier transform for this sequence algebraically is of this form , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,38,0,0,382.630,7,8,signalprocessing,we have this inherent periodicity in the fourier transform which i'm stressing very heavily because it forms the basic difference between continuous time and discrete time , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,39,0,0,396.170,7,8,signalprocessing,in addition to these properties of the fourier transform there are a number of other properties that are particularly useful in the manipulation of the fourier transform and in fact in using the fourier transform to for example analyze systems represented by linear constant coefficient difference equations , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,42,0,0,433.210,14,15,signalprocessing,and the time shifting property tells us that if x of omega is the fourier transform of x of n then the fourier transform of x of n shifted in time is that same fourier transform multiplied by this factor which is a linear phase factor , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,47,0,0,504.840,22,23,signalprocessing,another important property that we'll want to make use of shortly is linearity which follows in a very straightforward way from the fourier transform definition , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,48,0,0,516.860,8,9,signalprocessing,and the linearity property says simply that the fourier transform of a sum or linear combination is the same linear combination of the fourier transforms , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,50,0,0,532.750,38,39,signalprocessing,and also among other properties there is a parseval's relation for the discrete time case that in effect says something similar to continuous time specifically that the energy in the sequence is proportional to the energy in the fourier transform the energy over one period , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,51,0,0,557.370,30,31,signalprocessing,or said another way in fact or another way that it can be said is that the energy in the time domain is proportional to the power in this periodic fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,55,0,0,593.730,13,14,signalprocessing,the convolution property is the property that tells us how to relate the fourier transform of the convolution of two sequences to the fourier transforms of the individual sequences , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,56,0,0,608.940,14,15,signalprocessing,and not surprisingly what happens and this can be demonstrated algebraically not surprisingly the fourier transform of the convolution is simply the product of the fourier transforms , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,57,0,0,624.960,1,2,signalprocessing,so fourier transform maps convolution in the time domain to multiplication in the frequency domain , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,60,0,0,647.710,12,13,signalprocessing,the convolution property then tells us that in the frequency domain the fourier transform is the product of the fourier transform of the impulse response and the fourier transform of the input , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,61,0,0,665.120,12,13,signalprocessing,now we also saw and have talked about a relationship between the fourier transform the impulse response and what we call the frequency response in the context of the response of a system to a complex exponential , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,64,0,0,705.920,21,22,signalprocessing,and as you saw in the video course manual this eigenvalue this constant multiplier on the exponential is in fact the fourier transform of the impulse response evaluated at that frequency , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,67,0,0,733.280,6,7,signalprocessing,the frequency response interpretation of the fourier transform the impulse response we use that to motivate an intuitive interpretation of the convolution property , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,68,0,0,746.550,15,16,signalprocessing,now formally the convolution property can be developed by taking the convolution sum applying the fourier transform sum to it doing the appropriate substitution of variables interchanging order of summations et cetera and all the algebra works out to show that it's a product , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,71,0,0,783.330,6,7,signalprocessing,specifically the argument was that the fourier transform of a sequence or signal corresponds to decomposing it into a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,73,0,0,801.310,5,6,signalprocessing,it's basically proportional to the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,74,0,0,805.990,25,26,signalprocessing,if we think of pushing through the system that linear combination then each of those complex exponentials gets the amplitude modified or multiplied by the fourier transform of by the frequency response which we saw is the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,76,0,0,841.470,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier transform of the output in effect is an expression expressing the summation or integration of the output as a linear combination of all of these exponentials with the appropriate complex amplitudes , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,111,0,0,1191.140,14,15,signalprocessing,let's now consider generating the solution by taking advantage of the properties of the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,112,0,0,1199.270,13,14,signalprocessing,well just as we did in continuous time we can consider applying the fourier transform to both sides of this equation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,113,0,0,1207.210,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier transform of y of n of course is y of omega , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,114,0,0,1212.680,11,12,signalprocessing,and then using the shifting property the time shifting property the fourier transform of y of n minus one is y of omega multiplied by e to the minus j omega , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,116,0,0,1234.290,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier transform of x of n is x of omega , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,117,0,0,1239.020,8,9,signalprocessing,well we can solve this equation for the fourier transform of the output in terms of the fourier transform of the input and an appropriate complex scale factor , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,120,0,0,1275.860,9,10,signalprocessing,at this point we can recognize that here the fourier transform of the output is the product of the fourier transform of the input and some complex function , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,121,0,0,1288.860,20,21,signalprocessing,and from the convolution property then that complex function must in fact correspond to the frequency response or equivalently the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,122,0,0,1305.620,7,8,signalprocessing,so if we want to determine the fourier transform of the or the impulse response of the system let's say for example then it becomes a matter of having identified the fourier transform of the impulse response which is the frequency response , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,125,0,0,1330.730,16,17,signalprocessing,of course we could do it by attempting to go through the synthesis equation for the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,127,0,0,1345.362,18,19,signalprocessing,and in particular we know that from an example that we worked before this is in fact the fourier transform of a sequence which is a to the n times u of n , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,185,0,0,1983.200,15,16,signalprocessing,in applying the modulation property of course what we need to do is develop the fourier transform of this signal , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,189,0,0,2008.700,6,7,signalprocessing,and recall that to get the fourier transform of a periodic signal one way to do it is to generate the fourier series coefficients for the periodic signal and then identify the fourier transform as an impulse train where the heights of the impulses in the impulse train are proportional with a proportionality factor of two pi proportional to the fourier series coefficients , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,199,0,0,2130.950,8,9,signalprocessing,ok now if we want to get the fourier transform for this we take those coefficients and essentially generate an impulse train where we choose as values for the impulses two pi times the fourier series coefficients , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,201,0,0,2156.630,12,13,signalprocessing,so notice that in the plot that i've shown here of the fourier transform of x one of n we have the zero th coefficient , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,207,0,0,2205.560,26,27,signalprocessing,and of course if we drew this out over a longer frequency axis we would see lots of other impulses because of the fact that the fourier transform periodically repeats or equivalently the fourier series coefficients periodically repeat , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,213,0,0,2259.800,11,12,signalprocessing,let's consider a signal x two of n which has a fourier transform as i've indicated here , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,214,0,0,2267.300,2,3,signalprocessing,then the fourier transform of the product of x one of n and x two of n is the convolution of these two spectra , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,218,0,0,2316.180,8,9,signalprocessing,and so this spectrum finally corresponds to the fourier transform of minus one to the n times x two of n where x two of n is the sequence whose spectrum was x two of omega , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,225,0,0,2376.730,19,20,signalprocessing,let me draw your attention to the fact that when a is positive we have this sequence and its fourier transform is as i show on the right , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,227,0,0,2403.030,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier transform of that you can now see and verify also algebraically if you'd like is identical to this spectrum simply shifted by pi , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,237,0,0,2546.950,15,16,signalprocessing,so it says that the impulse response of the highpass filter or equivalently the inverse fourier transform of the highpass filter frequency response is minus one to the n times the impulse response for the lowpass filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,264,0,0,2809.380,9,10,signalprocessing,we had then generalized that to the continuous time fourier transform and in effect in doing that what happened is that the synthesis equation in the fourier series became an integral relationship in the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,277,0,0,2987.190,9,10,signalprocessing,and this term x of omega which is the fourier transform is given by this summation and of course involves all of the values of x of n , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,285,0,0,3055.900,5,6,signalprocessing,however for the continuous time fourier transform we're talking about aperiodic time functions and aperiodic frequency functions , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,287,0,0,3071.550,9,10,signalprocessing,in other words the time function effectively is the fourier transform of the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,289,0,0,3081.780,16,17,signalprocessing,and in fact we had exploited that duality property when we talked about the continuous time fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,293,0,0,3122.630,5,6,signalprocessing,and finally the discrete time fourier transform loses the duality because of the fact among other things that in the time domain things are inherently discrete whereas in the frequency domain they're inherently continuous , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,297,0,0,3159.610,12,13,signalprocessing,and we can see that first algebraically by comparing the continuous time fourier series and the discrete time fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,302,0,0,3214.990,25,26,signalprocessing,and in fact if you look at the relationship between these two then what we see in fact is a duality between the continuous time fourier series and the discrete time fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,303,0,0,3236.500,32,33,signalprocessing,one way of thinking of that is to kind of think and this is a little bit of a tongue twister which you might want to get straightened out slowly but the fourier transform in discrete time is a periodic function of frequency , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,307,0,0,3262.730,20,21,signalprocessing,well in fact except for an issue of time reversal what it is the original sequence for which that's the fourier transform , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,311,0,0,3295.000,6,7,signalprocessing,also as we've talked about the fourier transform both continuous time and discrete time two important properties that we focused on among many of the properties are the convolution property and the modulation property , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,0,0,101.260,15,16,signalprocessing,both for continuous time and for discrete time the convolution property tells us that the fourier transform of the convolution of two time functions is the product of the fourier transforms , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,0,0,119.190,47,48,signalprocessing,now what this means in terms of linear time invariant filters since we know that in the time domain the output of a linear time invariant filter is the convolution of the input and the impulse response it says essentially then in the frequency domain that the fourier transform of the output is the product the fourier transform of the impulse response namely the frequency response and the fourier transform of the input , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,156.370,7,8,signalprocessing,now recall also that in developing the fourier transform i interpreted the fourier transform as the complex amplitude of a decomposition of the signal in terms of a set of complex exponentials , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,47,0,0,454.760,10,11,signalprocessing,that means as a consequence of the properties of the fourier transform and inverse fourier transform that the impulse response is an even function in the time domain , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,91,0,0,891.480,34,35,signalprocessing,now we can write the differential equation for either of these systems and as we talked about last time in the last several lectures solve that equation using and exploiting the properties of the fourier transform , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,93,0,0,921.740,9,10,signalprocessing,and so just working our way down applying the fourier transform to the differential equation and generating the system function by taking the ratio of the capacitor voltage or its fourier transform to the fourier transform of the source we then have the system function associated with the system for which the output is the capacitor voltage , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,209,0,0,1859.870,5,6,signalprocessing,we've looked previously at the fourier transform of this rectangular sequence , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,210,0,0,1864.240,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier transform of that in fact is of the form of a sine n x over sine x curve , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,253,0,0,2257.540,23,24,signalprocessing,and so interpreting the first order difference equation as a system what we're attempting to generate is the frequency response which is the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,254,0,0,2272.760,23,24,signalprocessing,and from the difference equation we can of course solve for either one of those by using the properties exploiting the properties of fourier transform , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,255,0,0,2283.770,2,3,signalprocessing,applying the fourier transform to the difference equation we will end up with the fourier transform of the output equal to the fourier transform of the input times this factor which we know from the convolution property in fact is the frequency response of the system , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,257,0,0,2307.440,5,6,signalprocessing,and of course the inverse fourier transform of that which i indicate below is the system impulse response , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,258,0,0,2317.910,10,11,signalprocessing,so we have the frequency response obtained by applying the fourier transform to the difference equation the impulse response , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,23,0,0,294.670,28,29,signalprocessing,and what we'll see in particular as we go through today's lecture is that sinusoidal amplitude modulation follows in a fairly straightforward way from the properties of the fourier transform that we've developed in some of the earlier lectures , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,26,0,0,336.040,16,17,signalprocessing,and all of these follow in a very straightforward way from the modulation property for the fourier transform , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,34,0,0,401.640,19,20,signalprocessing,now to analyze this since we have multiplication in the time domain we know from the property of the fourier transform that we've developed previously the modulation property that multiplication in the time domain corresponds to convolution in the frequency domain , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,51,0,0,546.820,6,7,signalprocessing,what i've indicated here for the fourier transform of the input signal or modulating signal x of omega , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,53,0,0,565.760,13,14,signalprocessing,and then the carrier signal since it's a single complex exponential has a fourier transform which is an impulse in the frequency domain , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,351,0,0,3167.180,15,16,signalprocessing,so from what might have seemed like a fairly abstract mathematical property associated with the fourier transform we've begun to develop what should give you the sense of some important practical considerations , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,106,1,0,613.770,3,4,signalprocessing,it computes the fourier transform or the spectrum , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,110,1,0,649.410,24,25,signalprocessing,it's filtered and sampled and captured on a block basis put into a digital memory and then a digital computer or microprocessor computes the fourier transform , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,111,1,0,662.250,3,4,signalprocessing,and then that fourier transform is what we see on the display , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,112,1,0,666.930,10,11,signalprocessing,so what we're computing of course are samples of the fourier transform , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,114,1,0,676.040,5,6,signalprocessing,was a rectangular pulse whose fourier transform is of the form of a sine x over x function what we would in fact see on the display are samples of that at discrete frequencies , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,14,0,0,176.170,12,13,signalprocessing,and it was in continuous time the modulation property associated with the fourier transform that provided the basis for the analysis , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,16,0,0,192.120,17,18,signalprocessing,in particular what we have in discrete time is the modulation property as it relates to the fourier transform which tells us that the fourier transform of the modulated signal is the convolution of the fourier transform of the carrier and the fourier transform of the modulated signal , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,112,0,0,1478.860,14,15,signalprocessing,basically a square wave and as we've seen in previous lectures the spectra or fourier transform associated with that is an impulse train , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,114,0,0,1497.430,1,2,signalprocessing,the fourier transform is impulses , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,121,0,0,1537.780,8,9,signalprocessing,so in the frequency domain we have the fourier transform of the time function convolved with this fourier transform for the pulse train , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,123,0,0,1548.550,8,9,signalprocessing,if we were to consider let's say a fourier transform , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,5,1,0,59.960,50,51,signalprocessing,and just as a quick reminder the sampling theorem said that if we have a continuous time signal and we have equally spaced samples of that signal sampled at a sampling period which i indicate is capital t and if x of t is band limited in other words the fourier transform is zero outside some band where omega sub m is the highest frequency then under the condition that the sampling frequency which is two pi divided by the period is greater than twice the highest frequency , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,1,0,123.830,18,19,signalprocessing,and the sampling theorem developed by examining the consequence of the modulation property in the context of the fourier transform , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,1,0,133.940,70,71,signalprocessing,in particular if we have our signal x of t and if multiplied by an impulse train to give us a sampled signal another impulse train whose values or areas are samples of the original time function as i indicate here then in fact if we examine this equation or equivalently bringing x of t inside this sum if we examine either of these equations in the frequency domain the fourier transform of x of p of t is the convolution of the fourier transform of the original signal and the fourier transform of the impulse train , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,1,0,187.110,1,2,signalprocessing,it's fourier transform , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,13,1,0,193.880,12,13,signalprocessing,and when we do this convolution then using the fact that the fourier transform the impulse train is an impulse train , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,14,1,0,203.480,10,11,signalprocessing,the result of this convolution then tells us that the fourier transform of the sample signal or the impulse train which represents the samples is a sum of frequency shifted replications of the fourier transform of the original signal , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,18,1,0,249.280,72,73,signalprocessing,and again to remind you of the basic picture involved if we have an original signal with a spectrum as i indicated here where it's band limited with the highest frequency omega sub m and if the time function is sampled so that in the frequency domain we convolve this spectrum with the spectrum shown below which is the spectrum of the impulse train the convolution of these two is then the fourier transform or spectrum of the sample time function , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,23,1,0,345.990,1,2,signalprocessing,the fourier transform i show here of the original signal and after modulation with the impulse train the resulting spectrum that we have is that replicated around integer multiples of the sampling frequency , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,34,1,0,479.710,26,27,signalprocessing,if in fact the sampling frequency is not high enough to avoid aliasing then what happens in that case is that the individual replications of the fourier transform of the original signal overlap and what we end up with is some distortion , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,48,1,0,607.490,4,5,signalprocessing,and the spectrum or fourier transform of that is an impulse in the frequency domain at the frequency of the sinusoid , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,68,1,0,823.840,2,3,signalprocessing,and its fourier transform is an impulse in the frequency domain as we've indicated , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,70,1,0,835.670,9,10,signalprocessing,and so its samples in particular will have a fourier transform not only with an impulse at the input sinusoidal frequency but also at ten kilohertz minus that frequency , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,87,1,0,998.480,5,6,signalprocessing,the bottom trace is the fourier transform of the sampled waveform , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,171,0,0,1553.670,35,36,signalprocessing,well instead of the zero order hold if we used the first order hold corresponding to the triangular impulse response in that case then in the frequency domain the associated frequency response would be the fourier transform of the triangle , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,172,0,0,1569.090,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier transform of a triangle is a sine squared x over x squared kind of function , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,251,0,0,2311.670,40,41,signalprocessing,so what i'd like to do as a first step in understanding this process is to analyze it in particular with our attention focused on trying to understand what the relationship is in the frequency domain between the discrete time fourier transform of the sequence discrete time signal and the continuous time fourier transform of the original unsampled and then the sampled signal , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,261,0,0,2403.080,11,12,signalprocessing,so in the frequency domain we have a convolution of the fourier transform of the continuous time signal the original signal and the fourier transform of the impulse train which is itself an impulse train , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,262,0,0,2418.590,7,8,signalprocessing,so in the frequency domain then the fourier transform of the sampled signal which is an impulse train is the convolution of the fourier transform of the sampling function p of t and the fourier transform of the sampled signal , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,263,0,0,2436.440,10,11,signalprocessing,since the sampling signal is a periodic impulse train its fourier transform is an impulse train , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,264,0,0,2444.750,11,12,signalprocessing,and consequently carrying out this convolution in effect says that this fourier transform simply gets replicated at each of the locations of these impulses , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,265,0,0,2457.600,10,11,signalprocessing,and finally what we end up with then is a fourier transform after the sampling process which is the original fourier transform of the continuous signal but added to itself shifted by integer multiples of the sampling frequency , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,274,0,0,2533.840,10,11,signalprocessing,and what we want to relate is the discrete time fourier transform of this and the continuous time fourier transform of this or in fact the continuous time fourier transform of x of c of t , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,276,0,0,2554.930,2,3,signalprocessing,and it's fourier transform we can get by simply evaluating the fourier transform , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,277,0,0,2562.000,3,4,signalprocessing,and since the fourier transform of this since this corresponds to an impulse train the fourier transform by the time we change some sums and integrals will then have this impulse replaced by the fourier transform of the shifted impulse which is this exponential factor , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,278,0,0,2581.570,5,6,signalprocessing,so this expression is the fourier transform of the impulse train the continuous time fourier transform , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,279,0,0,2588.850,7,8,signalprocessing,and alternatively we can look at the fourier transform of the sequence , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,280,0,0,2595.080,8,9,signalprocessing,and this of course is a discrete time fourier transform , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,281,0,0,2601.110,6,7,signalprocessing,so we have the continuous time fourier transform of the impulse train we have the discrete fourier transform of the sequence , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,288,0,0,2669.970,14,15,signalprocessing,and so in fact the relationship that we have is that the discrete time fourier transform of the sequence of samples is equal to the continuous time fourier transform of the impulse train of samples where we associate the continuous time frequency variable and the discrete time frequency variable through a frequency scaling as i indicate here , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,292,0,0,2726.130,9,10,signalprocessing,in the frequency domain that corresponds to replicating the fourier transform of the original continuous time signal , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,310,0,0,2888.470,9,10,signalprocessing,in the frequency domain what we have is the fourier transform of our original continuous signal , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,60,0,0,739.790,23,24,signalprocessing,and so now the spectrum of y of n the output of the digital filter is the product of this spectrum and the fourier transform or frequency response of the digital filter , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,26,0,0,299.680,4,5,signalprocessing,as we know the fourier transform of an impulse train is itself an impulse train , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,27,0,0,305.560,5,6,signalprocessing,and so this is the fourier transform of the sampling sequence , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,28,0,0,311.990,4,5,signalprocessing,and now finally the fourier transform of the resulting sample sequence being the convolution of this with the fourier transform of the sequence that we're sampling , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,29,0,0,326.300,15,16,signalprocessing,gives us then a spectrum which consists of a sum of replicated versions of the fourier transform of the sequence that we're sampling , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,38,0,0,420.460,3,4,signalprocessing,this is its fourier transform with an assumed highest frequency omega sub m highest frequency over a two pi range or over a range of pi rather , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,45,0,0,489.740,34,35,signalprocessing,now when we look at this what we recognize is that we have basically the same issue here as we had in continuous time in the sense that when these individual replications of the fourier transform when the sampling frequency is chosen high enough so that they don't overlap then we see the potential for being able to get one of them back , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,50,0,0,567.160,9,10,signalprocessing,and in this picture the individual replications of the fourier transform of the original signal overlap , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,51,0,0,576.700,7,8,signalprocessing,and we can no longer recover the fourier transform of the original signal , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,54,0,0,598.680,9,10,signalprocessing,so in that case what we have is a fourier transform for the sampled signal which is as i indicated here and the fourier transform for the original signal as i indicate at the top , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,104,0,0,1082.870,10,11,signalprocessing,in particular what we want to develop is how the fourier transform of the decimated sequence is related to the fourier transform of the original sequence or the sample sequence , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,114,0,0,1170.990,7,8,signalprocessing,and we know of course that the fourier transform of the sample sequence is just simply this summation , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,119,0,0,1220.080,5,6,signalprocessing,so this then is the fourier transform all of the sampled signal , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,120,0,0,1225.590,7,8,signalprocessing,and now if we look at the fourier transform of the decimated signal that fourier transform of course is this summation on the decimated sequence , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,125,0,0,1276.740,20,21,signalprocessing,so the consequence of that then what it all boils down to and says is that the relationship between the fourier transform of the decimated sequence and the fourier transform of the sampled sequence is simply a frequency scaling corresponding to dividing the frequency axis by capital n , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,130,0,0,1324.470,9,10,signalprocessing,and in the frequency domain we have again the fourier transform of the original sequence and we have the fourier transform of the sampled sequence , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,131,0,0,1343.350,3,4,signalprocessing,and now the fourier transform of the decimated sequence is simply this spectrum with a linear frequency scaling , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,154,0,0,1566.490,15,16,signalprocessing,and so the result of that the product of the filter frequency response and the fourier transform of x of n would have a shape somewhat like i indicate below , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,244,0,0,2432.370,14,15,signalprocessing,suppose that you have a signal and what you'd like to measure is its fourier transform its spectrum , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,247,0,0,2452.280,14,15,signalprocessing,and so in fact all that you can really calculate or measure is the fourier transform at a set of sample frequencies , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,250,0,0,2471.060,26,27,signalprocessing,and a reasonable question to ask then is when does a set of samples in fact tell you everything that there is to know about the fourier transform , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,253,0,0,2511.160,6,7,signalprocessing,and so we would multiply the fourier transform of the signal whose spectrum is to be sampled by an impulse train in frequency , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,256,0,0,2547.670,3,4,signalprocessing,or correspondingly the fourier transform of the resulting signal is an impulse train in frequency with an envelope which is the original spectrum that we were sampling , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,267,0,0,2611.340,23,24,signalprocessing,so in fact if we look at this in the time domain the resulting picture corresponds to an original signal whose spectrum or fourier transform we've sampled , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,271,0,0,2669.660,10,11,signalprocessing,we know that an impulse train in frequency is the fourier transform of a periodic time function , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,274,0,0,2683.240,10,11,signalprocessing,we know this from way back when we talked about fourier transforms the envelope in fact is the fourier transform of one period , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,276,0,0,2696.620,10,11,signalprocessing,now given that we have this periodic time function whose fourier transform is the samples in the frequency domain how do we get back the original time function , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,284,0,0,2804.820,22,23,signalprocessing,namely if we have a discrete time signal and if the discrete time signal is a finite length if we sample its fourier transform the time function associated with those samples is a periodic replication , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,295,0,0,2916.510,11,12,signalprocessing,beginning in the next lecture what i will introduce is the laplace transform and beyond that the z transform , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,296,0,0,2926.740,10,11,signalprocessing,and what those will correspond to are generalizations of the fourier transform , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,297,0,0,2932.930,20,21,signalprocessing,so we now want to turn our attention back to some analytical tools in particular developing some generalizations of the fourier transform in both continuous time and discrete time , Lecture1IntroductionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,150,0,0,1597.630,23,24,signalprocessing,and in the context of the frequency domain representation some of the kinds of ideas and topics that we'll be exploring are the fourier transform and the laplace transform and a discrete time counterpart of the laplace transform which is the z transform , Lecture1IntroductionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,151,0,0,1619.140,1,2,signalprocessing,the fourier transform discussion we'll get into fairly early in the course , Lecture1IntroductionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,152,0,0,1623.990,11,12,signalprocessing,and the laplace transform and z transform represent extensions of the fourier transform and we'll be getting into that later in the course , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,4,0,0,56.170,19,20,signalprocessing,over the last series of lectures in discussing filtering modulation and sampling we've seen how powerful and useful the fourier transform is , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,5,0,0,66.490,20,21,signalprocessing,beginning with this lecture and over the next several lectures i'd like to develop and exploit a generalization of the fourier transform which will not only lead to some important new insights about signals and systems but also will remove some of the restrictions that we've had with the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,90.300,17,18,signalprocessing,the generalization that we'll be talking about in the continuous time case is referred to as the laplace transform and in the discrete time case is referred to as the z transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,7,0,0,103.680,20,21,signalprocessing,what i'd like to do in today's lecture is begin on the continuous time case namely a discussion of the laplace transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,125.080,20,21,signalprocessing,now to introduce the notion of the laplace transform let me remind you again of what led us into the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,135.380,3,4,signalprocessing,we developed the fourier transform by considering the idea of representing signals as linear combinations of basic signals , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,12,0,0,147.660,3,4,signalprocessing,and in the fourier transform in the continuous time case , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,19,0,0,227.100,18,19,signalprocessing,and this change in amplitude in fact corresponded as we showed as the discussion went along to the fourier transform of the system impulse response , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,20,0,0,240.380,15,16,signalprocessing,so the notion of decomposing signals into complex exponentials was very intimately connected and the fourier transform was very intimately connected with the eigenfunction property of complex exponentials for linear time invariant systems , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,37,0,0,406.660,15,16,signalprocessing,well in fact what that integral corresponds to is what we will define as the laplace transform of the impulse response , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,39,0,0,432.370,15,16,signalprocessing,and so in general it is this transformation on a time function which is the laplace transform of that time function and it's a function of s , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,40,0,0,445.050,5,6,signalprocessing,so the definition of the laplace transform is that the laplace transform of a time function x of t is the result of this transformation on x of t , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,41,0,0,459.990,16,17,signalprocessing,it's denoted as x of s and as a shorthand notation as we had with the fourier transform then we have in the time domain the time function x of t and in the laplace transform domain the function x of s , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,43,0,0,481.560,30,31,signalprocessing,now let me remind you that the development of that mapping is exactly the process the we went through initially in developing a mapping that ended up giving us the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,46,0,0,519.080,22,23,signalprocessing,well the discussion that we've gone through so far of course is very closely related to what we went through for the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,47,0,0,528.020,10,11,signalprocessing,the mapping that we've ended up with is called the laplace transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,48,0,0,531.850,23,24,signalprocessing,and as you can well imagine and perhaps may have recognized already there's a very close connection between the laplace transform and the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,49,0,0,543.500,18,19,signalprocessing,well to see one of the connections what we can observe is that if we look at the fourier transform expression and if we look at the laplace transform expression where s is now a general complex number sigma plus j omega these two expressions in fact are identical if in fact sigma is equal to zero , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,52,0,0,587.530,33,34,signalprocessing,what this then tells us is that if we have the laplace transform and if we look at the laplace transform at s equals j omega then that in fact corresponds to the fourier transform of x of t , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,56,0,0,625.470,15,16,signalprocessing,notice that on the left hand side of this equation x of s representing the laplace transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,58,0,0,644.140,13,14,signalprocessing,on the other hand the right hand side of the equation namely the fourier transform of x of t we've typically written as x of omega , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,61,0,0,667.920,17,18,signalprocessing,and a very straightforward way of dealing with that is to simply change our notation for the fourier transform recognizing that the fourier transform of course is a function of omega but it's also in fact a function of j omega , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,63,0,0,689.440,20,21,signalprocessing,in other words the laplace transform at s equals j omega just simply reduces both mathematically and notationally to the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,64,0,0,699.100,10,11,signalprocessing,so the notation that we'll now be adopting for the fourier transform is the notation whereby we express the fourier transform no longer simply as x of omega but choosing as the argument j omega , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,66,0,0,719.620,8,9,signalprocessing,now here we see one relationship between the fourier transform and the laplace transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,67,0,0,726.560,13,14,signalprocessing,namely that the laplace transform for s equals j omega reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,69,0,0,737.340,13,14,signalprocessing,in particular the fact that the laplace transform can be interpreted as the fourier transform of a modified version of x of t , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,73,0,0,758.225,6,7,signalprocessing,the laplace transform reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,74,0,0,762.540,8,9,signalprocessing,but now let's look at the more general laplace transform expression , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,78,0,0,800.140,17,18,signalprocessing,and now when we look at this what we observe is that this in fact is the fourier transform of something , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,80,0,0,812.160,8,9,signalprocessing,it's not x of t anymore it's the fourier transform of x of t multiplied by e to the minus sigma t , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,81,0,0,820.730,14,15,signalprocessing,so if we think of these two terms together this integral is just the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,82,0,0,826.930,2,3,signalprocessing,it's the fourier transform of x of t multiplied by an exponential , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,85,0,0,845.380,16,17,signalprocessing,so we have then this additional relationship which tells us that the laplace transform is the fourier transform of an exponentially weighted time function , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,87,0,0,866.000,11,12,signalprocessing,in particular recall that there were issues of convergence with the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,88,0,0,871.840,3,4,signalprocessing,in particular the fourier transform may or may not converge , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,91,0,0,896.760,13,14,signalprocessing,but when we multiply it by this exponential factor that's embodied in the laplace transform in fact that brings the function back down for positive time , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,93,0,0,917.190,13,14,signalprocessing,and so the conclusion an important point is that the laplace transform the fourier transform of this product may converge even though the fourier transform of x of t doesn't , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,94,0,0,929.530,11,12,signalprocessing,in other words the laplace transform may converge even when the fourier transform doesn't converge , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,97,0,0,948.720,26,27,signalprocessing,to the fact that this equation in effect provides the basis for us to figure out how to express x of t in terms of the laplace transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,98,0,0,963.100,7,8,signalprocessing,in effect we can apply the inverse fourier transform to this thereby to this account for the exponential factor by bringing it over to the other side , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,101,0,0,1016.160,10,11,signalprocessing,ok well let's just look at some examples of the laplace transform of some time functions , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,106,0,0,1046.329,4,5,signalprocessing,if we take the fourier transform of this exponential , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,110,0,0,1064.680,10,11,signalprocessing,what that really means is that for convergence of the fourier transform this has to be a decaying exponential , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,112,0,0,1076.620,5,6,signalprocessing,if instead we apply the laplace transform to this , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,113,0,0,1081.620,10,11,signalprocessing,applying the laplace transform is the same as taking the fourier transform of x of t times an exponential and the exponent that we would multiply by is e to the minus sigma t , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,114,0,0,1095.710,13,14,signalprocessing,so in effect taking the laplace transform of this is like taking the fourier transform of e to the minus at e to the minus sigma t , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,115,0,0,1109.860,16,17,signalprocessing,and if we carry that through just working through the integral we end up with a laplace transform which is one over s plus a , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,116,0,0,1122.200,5,6,signalprocessing,but just as in the fourier transform the fourier transform won't converge for any a , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,117,0,0,1130.980,13,14,signalprocessing,now what happens is that the laplace transform will only converge when the fourier transform of this converges , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,121,0,0,1159.510,5,6,signalprocessing,so in fact in the laplace transform of this we have an expression one over s plus a , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,123,0,0,1177.430,4,5,signalprocessing,so that essentially the fourier transform of x of t times e to the minus sigma t converges , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,125,0,0,1196.580,14,15,signalprocessing,and so for this example we can summarize it as this exponential has a laplace transform which is one over s plus a where s is restricted to the range the real part of s greater than minus a , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,127,0,0,1220.210,2,3,signalprocessing,with the fourier transform either it converged or it didn't converge , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,128,0,0,1223.880,2,3,signalprocessing,with the laplace transform there are certain values of s , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,130,0,0,1236.360,7,8,signalprocessing,the values of s for which the laplace transform converges is the values are referred to as the region of convergence of the laplace transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,131,0,0,1250.580,9,10,signalprocessing,and it's important to recognize that in specifying the laplace transform what's required is not only the algebraic expression but also the domain or set of values of s for which that algebraic expression is valid , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,134,0,0,1290.040,13,14,signalprocessing,and if you carry through the algebra there you end up with a laplace transform expression which is again one over s plus a , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,143,0,0,1364.280,14,15,signalprocessing,now later on in this lecture and actually also as the discussion of the laplace transform goes on we'll begin to see and understand more about how the region of convergence relates to various properties of the time function , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,146,0,0,1398.620,10,11,signalprocessing,and although we haven't formally talked about properties of the laplace transform yet one of the properties that we'll see and it's relatively easy to develop is the fact that the laplace transform of a sum is the sum of the laplace transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,147,0,0,1413.430,7,8,signalprocessing,so in fact we can get the laplace transform of the sum of these two terms as the sum of the laplace transforms , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,149,0,0,1441.180,6,7,signalprocessing,for this one we have a laplace transform which is one over s plus two with a region of convergence which is the real part of s greater than minus two , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,166,0,0,1584.190,6,7,signalprocessing,well this particular example has the laplace transform as a rational function , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,175,0,0,1642.760,14,15,signalprocessing,the roots of the numerator polynomial are referred to as the zeroes of the laplace transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,177,0,0,1656.790,15,16,signalprocessing,and the roots of the denominator polynomial are referred to as the poles of the laplace transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,178,0,0,1664.900,10,11,signalprocessing,and those are the values of s at which the laplace transform blows up , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,182,0,0,1689.360,18,19,signalprocessing,what we would expect is that wherever that happens there must be some problem with convergence of the laplace transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,183,0,0,1695.930,3,4,signalprocessing,and indeed the laplace transform doesn't converge at the poles , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,186,0,0,1708.120,11,12,signalprocessing,let's examine and talk about the region of convergence of the laplace transform and how it's associated both with properties of the time function and also with the location of the poles of the laplace transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,194,0,0,1786.160,45,46,signalprocessing,and one for example is the statement that if i have a point in the s plane that corresponds to convergence then in fact any line in the s plane with that same real part will also be a set of values for which the laplace transform converges , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,196,0,0,1809.450,24,25,signalprocessing,the reason for that is that s is sigma plus j omega and convergence of the laplace transform is associated with convergence of the fourier transform of e to the minus sigma t times x of t , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,203,0,0,1869.360,15,16,signalprocessing,now finally we can tie together the region of convergence to the convergence of the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,204,0,0,1877.980,12,13,signalprocessing,in particular since we know that the laplace transform reduces to the fourier transform when the complex variable s is equal to j omega the implication is that if we have the laplace transform and if the laplace transform reduces to the fourier transform when sigma equals zero , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,205,0,0,1904.440,12,13,signalprocessing,in other words when s is equal to j omega then the fourier transform of x of t converging is equivalent to the statement that the laplace transform converges for sigma equal to zero , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,211,0,0,1945.240,10,11,signalprocessing,and that is that the region of convergence of the laplace transform is a connected region , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,214,0,0,1970.420,6,7,signalprocessing,let's suppose that i have a laplace transform and the laplace transform that i'm talking about is a rational function which is one over s plus one times s plus two , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,231,0,0,2111.250,7,8,signalprocessing,associate the region of convergence of the laplace transform with some very specific characteristics of the time function , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,236,0,0,2158.230,4,5,signalprocessing,now recall that the fourier transform converges if the time function has the property that it's absolutely integrable , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,238,0,0,2177.830,3,4,signalprocessing,now here the fourier transform will converge , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,239,0,0,2181.040,16,17,signalprocessing,and now the question is what can we say about the region of convergence of the laplace transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,240,0,0,2189.770,6,7,signalprocessing,well the laplace transform is the fourier transform of the time function multiplied by an exponential , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,263,0,0,2425.420,33,34,signalprocessing,in particular we can make the statement that if the time function is right sided and if convergence occurs for some value sigma zero then in fact we will have convergence of the laplace transform for all values of the real part of s greater than sigma zero , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,267,0,0,2493.190,25,26,signalprocessing,if you put those two statements together then we end up with a statement that if x of t is right sided and if its laplace transform is rational then the region of convergence is to the right of the rightmost pole , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,278,0,0,2612.500,27,28,signalprocessing,now similar to the statement that we made for right sided signals if x of t is left sided and in fact we're talking about a rational laplace transform which we most typically will , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,292,0,0,2746.040,27,28,signalprocessing,well if we have a laplace transform we can in principle get the time function back again by recognizing this relationship between the laplace transform and the fourier transform and using the formal fourier transform expression , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,293,0,0,2760.650,5,6,signalprocessing,or equivalently the formal inverse laplace transform expression which is in the text , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,294,0,0,2767.190,14,15,signalprocessing,but more typically what we would do is what we've done also with the fourier transform which is to use simple laplace transform pairs together with the notion of the partial fraction expansion , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,296,0,0,2788.020,6,7,signalprocessing,let's suppose that i have a laplace transform as i indicated here in its pole zero plot and a region of convergence which is to the right of this pole , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,305,0,0,2861.960,24,25,signalprocessing,recognizing that this is to the right of the poles that tells us immediately that each of these two then would correspond to the laplace transform of a right sided time function , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,312,0,0,2909.370,29,30,signalprocessing,if you think back to that example or refer to your notes we know that time function of the form e to the minus a t gives us the laplace transform which is one over s plus a with the real part of s greater than minus a , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,313,0,0,2927.530,5,6,signalprocessing,and so this is the laplace transform of the first , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,314,0,0,2930.620,7,8,signalprocessing,or i'm sorry this is the inverse laplace transform of the first term , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,320,0,0,2983.210,27,28,signalprocessing,and if we simply put the two terms together then adding the one that we have here to what we had before we have a total inverse laplace transform which is that , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,337,0,0,3144.950,13,14,signalprocessing,ok well what we've gone through rather quickly is an introduction to the laplace transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,338,0,0,3152.510,21,22,signalprocessing,and a couple of points to underscore again is the fact that the laplace transform is very closely associated with the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,339,0,0,3162.690,14,15,signalprocessing,and in fact the laplace transform for s equals j omega reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,340,0,0,3169.570,8,9,signalprocessing,but more generally the laplace transform is the fourier transform of x of t with an exponential weighting , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,342,0,0,3185.010,10,11,signalprocessing,there are other exponentials for which that product has a fourier transform that doesn't converge , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,343,0,0,3190.780,8,9,signalprocessing,that then imposes on the discussion of the laplace transform what we refer to as the region of convergence , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,344,0,0,3198.860,10,11,signalprocessing,and it's very important to understand that in specifying a laplace transform it's important to identify not only the algebraic expression but also the values of s for which it's valid , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,345,0,0,3215.620,7,8,signalprocessing,namely the region of convergence of the laplace transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,346,0,0,3219.490,27,28,signalprocessing,finally what we did was to tie together some properties of a time function with things that we can say about the region of convergence of its laplace transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,347,0,0,3232.060,5,6,signalprocessing,now just as with the fourier transform the laplace transform has some very important properties , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,348,0,0,3238.670,12,13,signalprocessing,and out of these properties both are some mechanisms for using the laplace transform for such systems as those described by linear constant coefficient differential equations , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,350,0,0,3257.900,13,14,signalprocessing,as we understand them further will help us in using and exploiting the laplace transform to study and understand linear time invariant systems , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,352,0,0,3274.970,24,25,signalprocessing,in particular talking about properties and then associating with linear time invariant systems much of the discussion that we've had today relating to the laplace transform , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,4,0,0,56.490,12,13,signalprocessing,last time we introduced the laplace transform as a generalization of the fourier transform and just as a reminder the laplace transform expression as we developed it is this integral very much similar to the fourier transform integral except with a more general complex variable , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,5,0,0,79.210,16,17,signalprocessing,and in fact we developed and talked about the relationship between the laplace transform and the fourier transform , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,86.260,18,19,signalprocessing,in particular the laplace transform with the laplace transform variable s purely imaginary in fact reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,7,0,0,98.970,17,18,signalprocessing,or more generally with the laplace transform variable as a complex number the laplace transform is the fourier transform of the corresponding time function with an exponential weighting , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,0,0,115.280,14,15,signalprocessing,and also as you should recall the exponential waiting introduced the notion that the laplace transform may converge for some values of sigma and perhaps not for other values of sigma , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,0,0,130.360,4,5,signalprocessing,so associated with the laplace transform was what we refer to as the region of convergence , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,140.400,5,6,signalprocessing,now just as with the fourier transform there are a number of properties of the laplace transform that are extremely useful in describing and analyzing signals and systems , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,12,0,0,159.200,20,21,signalprocessing,took advantage of in our discussion last time was the linearly the linearity property which says in essence that the laplace transform of the linear combination of two time functions is the same linear combination of the associated laplace transforms , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,14,0,0,183.640,12,13,signalprocessing,which tells us how the derivative of a time function rather the laplace transform of the derivative is related to the laplace transform , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,15,0,0,194.710,3,4,signalprocessing,in particular the laplace transform of the derivative is the laplace transform x of t multiplied by s , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,16,0,0,203.320,20,21,signalprocessing,and as you can see by just setting s equal to j omega in fact this reduces to the corresponding fourier transform property , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,19,0,0,225.700,7,8,signalprocessing,here the convolution property says that the laplace transform of the convolution of two time functions is the product of the associated laplace transforms , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,22,0,0,275.130,25,26,signalprocessing,now the convolution property leads to of course a very important and useful mechanism for dealing with linear time invariant systems very much as the fourier transform did , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,24,0,0,304.390,2,3,signalprocessing,in the laplace transform domain the laplace transform of the output is the laplace transform of the impulse response times the laplace transform of the input , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,26,0,0,324.220,5,6,signalprocessing,in the case of the fourier transform the fourier transform the impulse response we refer to as the frequency response , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,27,0,0,332.430,6,7,signalprocessing,in the more general case with laplace transforms it's typical to refer to the laplace transform of the impulse response as the system function , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,31,0,0,385.390,12,13,signalprocessing,and that in fact is the same condition for convergence of the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,34,0,0,405.710,11,12,signalprocessing,which of course is where the laplace transform reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,53,0,0,554.870,14,15,signalprocessing,and if we apply to this equation the differentiation property then the derivative the laplace transform of the derivative is s times the laplace transform of the time function , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,55,0,0,572.580,5,6,signalprocessing,and so consequently applying the laplace transform to this equation leads us to this algebraic equation and following that through leads us to the statement that the laplace transform of the output is one over s plus a times the laplace transform of the input , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,56,0,0,590.620,8,9,signalprocessing,we know from the convolution property that this laplace transform is the system function times x of s , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,57,0,0,598.020,14,15,signalprocessing,and so one over s plus a is the system function or equivalently the laplace transform of the impulse response , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,58,0,0,607.420,11,12,signalprocessing,so we can determine the impulse response by taking the inverse laplace transform of h of s given by one over s plus a , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,60,0,0,628.620,9,10,signalprocessing,the question is then what time function has a laplace transform which is one over s plus a , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,61,0,0,635.640,21,22,signalprocessing,the problem that we run into is that there are two answers to that one over s plus a is the laplace transform of an exponential for positive time but one over s plus a is also the laplace transform of an exponential for negative time , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,65,0,0,676.740,7,8,signalprocessing,in this case this was the corresponding laplace transform provided that the real part of s is less than minus a , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,84,0,0,832.950,14,15,signalprocessing,we can determine the system function in exactly the same way namely apply the laplace transform to this equation , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,115,0,0,1129.720,7,8,signalprocessing,and that corresponds to looking at the fourier transform of the impulse response which is the laplace transform on the j omega axis , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,249,0,0,2508.940,14,15,signalprocessing,we've been talking for the last several lectures about continuous time systems and the laplace transform , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,250,0,0,2517.230,17,18,signalprocessing,hopefully what you've seen in this lecture and the previous lecture is the powerful tool that the laplace transform affords us in analyzing and understanding system behavior , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,251,0,0,2534.440,74,75,signalprocessing,in the next lecture what i'd like to do is parallel the discussion for discrete time turn our attention to the z transform and as you can imagine simply by virtue of the fact that i have shown you a digital and analog version of very much the same kind of system the discussions parallel themselves very strongly and the z transform will play very much the same role in discrete time that the laplace transform does in continuous time , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,4,0,0,56.890,14,15,signalprocessing,in the last several lectures we've talked about a generalization of the continuous time fourier transform and a very similar strategy also applies to discrete time and that's what we want to begin to deal with in today's lecture , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,5,0,0,72.750,10,11,signalprocessing,so what we want to talk about is generalizing the fourier transform and what this will lead to in discrete time is a notion referred to as the z transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,84.380,10,11,signalprocessing,now just as in continuous time in discrete time the fourier transform corresponded to a representation of a sequence as a linear combination of complex exponentials , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,12,0,0,133.820,22,23,signalprocessing,and the change in complex amplitude which corresponds to the frequency response in fact is what led to the definition of the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,13,0,0,145.640,5,6,signalprocessing,in particular it is the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,14,0,0,151.610,25,26,signalprocessing,well that set of notions is more or less identical to the way we motivated the laplace transform in the continuous time case in the fourier transform in the continuous time case , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,34,0,0,429.260,19,20,signalprocessing,so we've kind of motivated the development in a manner exactly identical to what we had done with the laplace transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,36,0,0,453.750,12,13,signalprocessing,and that corresponds to the z transform here it corresponded to the laplace transform in the continuous time case , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,37,0,0,461.760,17,18,signalprocessing,that same argument is also the kind of argument that we use to lead us into the fourier transform originally , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,38,0,0,471.200,21,22,signalprocessing,and once again what you would expect is that the z transform has a very close and important relationship to the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,40,0,0,486.730,10,11,signalprocessing,identical to the relationship between the laplace transform and the fourier transform in continuous time , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,42,0,0,498.650,12,13,signalprocessing,first of all what we recognize is that if we compare the fourier transform expression for a sequence and the z transform expression for the same sequence that they involve essentially the same operations , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,44,0,0,536.900,20,21,signalprocessing,said another way the z transform when z is e to the j omega is going to reduce to the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,45,0,0,547.900,18,19,signalprocessing,so we have a relationship like the one again that we had between the laplace transform and the fourier transform in continuous time , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,46,0,0,556.710,20,21,signalprocessing,namely that for a certain set of values of the complex variable the transform the z transform reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,49,0,0,592.050,6,7,signalprocessing,then this is equal to the fourier transform of the sequence , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,50,0,0,597.290,15,16,signalprocessing,so the z transform for z equal to e to the j omega is the fourier transform and so this then corresponds to x of omega , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,51,0,0,611.290,2,3,signalprocessing,namely the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,52,0,0,615.000,19,20,signalprocessing,well we now have ourselves in a similar situation again to what we had when we talked about the laplace transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,57,0,0,656.240,4,5,signalprocessing,well in fact the fourier transform is a function of omega , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,59,0,0,662.620,17,18,signalprocessing,and now what we can see is that given the fact that we want to generalize the fourier transform to the z transform it's convenient now to use as notation for the fourier transform x of z with z equal to e to the j omega , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,61,0,0,686.640,14,15,signalprocessing,so just summarizing that our new notation is that the independent variable on the fourier transform is now going to be expressed as e to the j omega rather than as omega , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,63,0,0,715.200,9,10,signalprocessing,it's very similar to what we did with the laplace transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,64,0,0,718.440,26,27,signalprocessing,but let me draw your attention to the fact that in the laplace transform the independent variable that we ended up with in talking about the fourier transform is different than what we're ending up with here , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,67,0,0,758.100,7,8,signalprocessing,so we have one relationship between the fourier transform and the z transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,68,0,0,763.060,18,19,signalprocessing,namely the fact that for the magnitude of z equal to one the z transform reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,69,0,0,773.390,23,24,signalprocessing,now in the laplace transform we also had another important relationship and observation which was the fact that the laplace transform was the fourier transform of x of t modified , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,73,0,0,805.430,23,24,signalprocessing,in particular in addition to the fact that the z transform for z equal to e to the j omega reduces to the fourier transform we'll see that the z transform for other values of z is the fourier transform of the sequence with an exponential weighting , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,79,0,0,875.530,26,27,signalprocessing,well what this says is that the z transform which is this at z equal to r e to the j omega is in fact the fourier transform of what , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,80,0,0,893.200,2,3,signalprocessing,it's the fourier transform of x of n multiplied by r to the minus n , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,82,0,0,906.200,11,12,signalprocessing,and in continuous time we had the laplace transform as the fourier transform of x of t e to the minus sigma t , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,83,0,0,915.710,4,5,signalprocessing,here we have the fourier transform of x of n r to the minus n , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,97,0,0,1016.460,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier transform as we've seen in earlier lectures is one over one minus a e to the minus j omega , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,99,0,0,1028.540,6,7,signalprocessing,in particular for convergence of the fourier transform we would require absolute summability of the original sequence , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,101,0,0,1042.250,2,3,signalprocessing,so the fourier transform is this provided that the magnitude of a is less than one , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,102,0,0,1048.140,4,5,signalprocessing,and what is the fourier transform if the magnitude of a is not less than one , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,112,0,0,1115.710,6,7,signalprocessing,now the z transform is the fourier transform of the sequence a to the n times r to the minus n , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,113,0,0,1128.090,54,55,signalprocessing,and this statement about the z transform converging is exactly identical to the statement that what we're requiring is that the magnitude of a times r to the minus one be less than one where this represents the exponential factor that we have that in effect is applied to the sequence so that the fourier transform becomes the z transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,114,0,0,1163.430,26,27,signalprocessing,and so if we put this condition we can interpret this condition in exactly the same way that we interpret the condition on convergence of the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,121,0,0,1232.820,5,6,signalprocessing,and just as with the laplace transform this range of values is referred to as the region of convergence of the z transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,122,0,0,1247.530,7,8,signalprocessing,now again as we saw with the laplace transform it's important to recognize that in specifying or having worked out the z transform of a sequence it's not just the algebraic expression but also the region of convergence that's required to uniquely specify it , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,129,0,0,1326.230,5,6,signalprocessing,and also as with the laplace transform it's convenient in looking at the z transform to represent it in the complex plane , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,130,0,0,1342.330,21,22,signalprocessing,in this case the complex plane referred to as the z plane whereas in continuous time when we talked about the laplace transform it was the s plane z of course because z is the complex variable in terms of which we're representing the z transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,134,0,0,1379.750,22,23,signalprocessing,recall that in the discussion that we just came from when we talked about the relationship between the z transform and the fourier transform the z transform reduces to the fourier transform when the magnitude of z is equal to one , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,137,0,0,1408.880,17,18,signalprocessing,and so it's on this contour in the z plane that the z transform reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,139,0,0,1423.550,31,32,signalprocessing,just again to emphasize the relationships and differences with continuous time with the laplace transform it's the behavior in the s plane on the j omega axis that corresponds to the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,140,0,0,1438.440,15,16,signalprocessing,here it's the behavior on the unit circle where the z transform corresponds to the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,142,0,0,1448.930,5,6,signalprocessing,as we did with the laplace transform we'll be talking very often about transforms which are rational and rational transforms as we'll see represent systems which are characterized by linear constant coefficient difference equations , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,162,0,0,1655.240,12,13,signalprocessing,and so in fact that would say that the sequence has a fourier transform that converges , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,166,0,0,1679.570,16,17,signalprocessing,and so this example with the magnitude of a less than one does not have a fourier transform that converges , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,167,0,0,1687.950,13,14,signalprocessing,well assuming that the magnitude of a is less than one and the fourier transform converges we can in fact look at the fourier transform by observing what happens as we go around the unit circle , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,168,0,0,1704.460,6,7,signalprocessing,we had seen this with the laplace transform in terms of observing what happened as we move along the j omega axis , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,172,0,0,1744.200,4,5,signalprocessing,and to observe the fourier transform we would observe how those vectors change in length as we move around the unit circle , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,173,0,0,1755.030,26,27,signalprocessing,and as we move around the unit circle what we would trace out in terms of the ratio of the lengths of those vectors is the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,178,0,0,1794.810,8,9,signalprocessing,and so here if we assumed that the fourier transform of the associated sequence converged then again we would look at the behavior of this as we moved around the unit circle , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,180,0,0,1819.060,3,4,signalprocessing,i'm sorry the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,181,0,0,1821.220,2,3,signalprocessing,so the fourier transform magnitude would consist of the ratio of the lengths of the zero vectors divided by the lengths of the pole vectors , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,186,0,0,1865.940,8,9,signalprocessing,so in fact if we looked at the fourier transform associated with this pole zero pattern if this was for example represented the z transform of the impulse response or a linear time invariant system the corresponding frequency response would be what i plotted out below , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,189,0,0,1905.950,11,12,signalprocessing,so as we sweep past this pole then in fact this fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,196,0,0,1958.640,4,5,signalprocessing,and to generate the fourier transform we want to look at the behavior of the pole and zero vectors as we move around the unit circle , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,199,0,0,1978.250,5,6,signalprocessing,and the magnitude of the fourier transform will be as we discussed the magnitude of the length of the zero vector is divided by the magnitude of the length of the pole vectors , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,200,0,0,1990.580,5,6,signalprocessing,shown below will be the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,201,0,0,1994.760,4,5,signalprocessing,and we have the fourier transform displayed here from zero to two pi rather than from minus pi to pi as it was displayed in the transparency , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,202,0,0,2005.640,6,7,signalprocessing,because of the periodicity of the fourier transform both of those are equivalent , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,204,0,0,2020.590,9,10,signalprocessing,and that of course generates a change in the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,206,0,0,2043.370,7,8,signalprocessing,and that generates a residence in the fourier transform very similar to what we saw in continuous time , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,208,0,0,2062.050,8,9,signalprocessing,and so in fact the magnitude of the fourier transform will decrease , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,213,0,0,2104.960,7,8,signalprocessing,and because of the symmetry in the fourier transform what we will see in the magnitude is identical to what we would see if we swept from omega equal to pi back clockwise to omega equals zero , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,218,0,0,2159.400,7,8,signalprocessing,now finally let's also look at the fourier transform associated with the first order example that we discussed earlier in the lecture , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,219,0,0,2171.370,10,11,signalprocessing,and so what we'll want to look at is the fourier transform as the pole and zero vectors change , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,220,0,0,2178.990,3,4,signalprocessing,once again the fourier transform will be displayed on a scale from zero to two pi a frequency scale from zero to two pi rather than minus pi to pi , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,228,0,0,2241.890,9,10,signalprocessing,and so that means that the magnitude of the fourier transform will decrease monotonically until we get past omega equal to pi , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,231,0,0,2281.320,8,9,signalprocessing,since because of the symmetry again of the fourier transform magnitude sweeping from pi to two pi is going to be equivalent with regard to the magnitude to sweeping from pi back to zero , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,232,0,0,2297.400,17,18,signalprocessing,and so now the pole vector begins to decrease in length and correspondingly the magnitude of the fourier transform will increase , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,234,0,0,2318.020,19,20,signalprocessing,and obviously if we continue to sweep around again we would simply trace out other periods associated with the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,236,0,0,2342.760,26,27,signalprocessing,and of course you can see that because the circle is periodic as we go around and around of course what we'll get is a periodic fourier transform which is the way fourier transforms are supposed to be , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,237,0,0,2356.990,5,6,signalprocessing,now just as with the laplace transform the region of convergence of the z transform as we've seen in this example is a very important part of the specification of the z transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,244,0,0,2452.420,4,5,signalprocessing,recall that with the laplace transform the region of convergence consisted of strips in the s plane , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,246,0,0,2472.490,3,4,signalprocessing,whereas with the laplace transform the region of convergence was dependent on the real part of s , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,249,0,0,2496.420,12,13,signalprocessing,furthermore as we've already talked about and exploited actually convergence of the fourier transform is equivalent to the statement that the region of convergence includes the unit circle in the z plane , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,252,0,0,2532.550,18,19,signalprocessing,if we have a finite duration sequence so that the sequence is absolutely summable and therefore has a fourier transform that converges then because of the fact that it's zero outside some interval i can multiply it by an exponentially decaying sequence or by an exponentially growing sequence , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,259,0,0,2639.300,32,33,signalprocessing,if we combine that statement with the fact that there are no poles in the region of convergence then we end up with a statement similar to what we had with the laplace transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,274,0,0,2771.130,10,11,signalprocessing,in other words it's the only one for which the fourier transform converges , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,276,0,0,2779.830,15,16,signalprocessing,and i've emphasized the fact that it parallels very closely what we did with the laplace transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,279,0,0,2806.580,21,22,signalprocessing,and the algebra for this is gone through in the text and you went through something similar to this with the laplace transform in the video course manual , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,281,0,0,2819.350,20,21,signalprocessing,but basically what we can use to develop a formal expression is the fact that the z transform is the fourier transform of the sequence exponentially weighted , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,285,0,0,2865.390,14,15,signalprocessing,and so there's a formal expression just as there's a formal expression for the laplace transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,287,0,0,2887.350,35,36,signalprocessing,so if we had a z transform as i indicate here and if we expand it out in a partial fraction expansion then we can recognize as we did in a similar style with the laplace transform we can recognize that each term together with the identified region of convergence corresponds to an exponential factor , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,300,0,0,3030.330,17,18,signalprocessing,on the other hand i've stressed that it's very similar to what we went through for the laplace transform except for a very important difference , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,301,0,0,3041.320,31,32,signalprocessing,the principal difference really being that with the laplace transform it was the j omega axis in the s plane that we focused attention on when we were thinking about the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,303,0,0,3058.580,27,28,signalprocessing,what we'll see when we continue this in the next lecture is that there are properties of the z transform just as there were properties of the laplace transform , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,5,0,0,61.240,16,17,signalprocessing,as with the laplace transform in continuous time we developed it as a generalization of the fourier transform , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,8,0,0,87.660,14,15,signalprocessing,but we focused in particular on the relationship between the z transform and the fourier transform pointing out first of all that the z transform when we choose the magnitude of z equal to one so the magnitude of z of the form e to the j omega just simply reduces to the fourier transform of the sequence , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,10,0,0,122.640,34,35,signalprocessing,in the discrete time z transform case we expressed that complex number in polar form as r e to the j omega and recognize that the z transform expression in fact corresponds to the fourier transform of the sequence exponentially weighted , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,13,0,0,177.900,15,16,signalprocessing,now they z transform has a number of important and useful properties just as the laplace transform does , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,23,0,0,317.580,25,26,signalprocessing,again very much the same as what we had in continuous time and also what we had in the context of the discussion with the fourier transform , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,24,0,0,329.410,12,13,signalprocessing,in fact because of the relationship between the z transform and the fourier transform the z transform of the impulse response evaluated on the unit circle in other words for the magnitude of z equal to one in fact corresponds to the frequency response of the system , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,32,0,0,451.450,6,7,signalprocessing,furthermore when we talked about the fourier transform , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,33,0,0,455.640,1,2,signalprocessing,the fourier transform of a sequence converges if the sequence is absolutely summable , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,34,0,0,464.500,17,18,signalprocessing,so in fact the condition for stability of a system and the condition for convergence of the fourier transform of its impulse response are the same condition namely absolute summability , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,36,0,0,482.750,7,8,signalprocessing,what it means is that if the fourier transform converges , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,39,0,0,505.210,9,10,signalprocessing,in other words the impulse response must have a fourier transform that converges , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,66,0,0,842.670,12,13,signalprocessing,well we have the same issue here as we had with the laplace transform namely the point that the difference equation tells us in essence what the algebraic expression is for the system function but doesn't specify the region of convergence , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,97,0,0,1148.500,5,6,signalprocessing,we in fact evaluated the fourier transform associated with this pole zero pattern last time , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,101,0,0,1189.020,17,18,signalprocessing,this is now a look at the z transform and we see very strong parallels to the laplace transform , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,104,0,0,1227.460,49,50,signalprocessing,what i'd like to do now is turn our attention to another very important reason for mapping from continuous time to discrete time and in the process of doing this what we'll need to do is exploit fairly heavily the insight intuition and procedures that we've developed for the laplace transform and the z transform , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,140,0,0,1656.560,10,11,signalprocessing,now what we can use are the properties of the laplace transform and the z transform to see what this means in terms of a mapping in particular using the differentiation property for laplace transforms , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,141,0,0,1672.390,2,3,signalprocessing,in the laplace transform domain we would have this , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,175,0,0,2114.030,16,17,signalprocessing,remembering the issues of sampling the discrete time frequency response then since the frequency responses the fourier transform of the impulse response is related to the continuous time impulse response as i indicate here what this says is that it is the superposition of replications of the continuous time frequency response linearly scaled in frequency and shifted and added to each other , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,183,0,0,2208.200,27,28,signalprocessing,if we expand this in a partial fraction expansion and we look at the impulse response associated with this we know how to take the inverse of laplace transform of this where i'm just naturally assuming causality throughout the discussion the continuous time impulse response then is the sum of exponentials with these amplitudes and at these complex exponential frequencies , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,22,0,0,244.910,20,21,signalprocessing,and in order to convert this to an expression describing the system function or in terms of the more general laplace transform variable s what we recognize is that j omega in the more general setting simply corresponds to the laplace transform variable s , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,23,0,0,265.860,7,8,signalprocessing,so this product in fact is the laplace transform for s equal to j omega , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,126,0,0,1524.430,28,29,signalprocessing,the bilinear transformation which i won't try to derive here in any detail is a mapping of continuous time filters to discrete time filters corresponding to taking the laplace transform variable s in the continuous time filter and replacing it by what is referred to as a bilinear function of z , Lecture25FeedbackMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,118,0,0,1138.460,17,18,signalprocessing,in generating the equivalent system function for the overall system it's best done in the frequency or laplace transform domain rather than in the time domain , Lecture25FeedbackMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,121,0,0,1158.480,25,26,signalprocessing,but basically if we look at this feedback system we can label of course since the output is y of t we can label the laplace transform of the output as y of s , Lecture25FeedbackMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,123,0,0,1175.330,7,8,signalprocessing,because this is the system function the laplace transform of r of t is simply the laplace transform of this input which is y of s times g of s , Lecture25FeedbackMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,126,0,0,1195.940,3,4,signalprocessing,and so the laplace transform of the error signal is simply x of s minus r of s which is y of s g of s , Lecture25FeedbackMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,128,0,0,1212.440,2,3,signalprocessing,that's the laplace transform of the error signal , Lecture25FeedbackMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,129,0,0,1215.580,1,2,signalprocessing,the laplace transform of the output of this system is simply this expression times h of s , Lecture25FeedbackMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,165,0,0,1553.060,14,15,signalprocessing,and we want to look at frequency response so we'll look specifically at the fourier transform , Lecture25FeedbackMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,166,0,0,1558.620,16,17,signalprocessing,and of course the frequency response of the overall system is the frequency response of the fourier transform of the output divided by the input , Lecture25FeedbackMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,192,0,0,1763.610,3,4,signalprocessing,namely has a laplace transform or system function which is one over p of s , Lecture26FeedbackExampleTheInvertedPendulumMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,60,1,0,530.900,5,6,signalprocessing,and if we apply the laplace transform to this equation and solve for the system function then the basic equation that we're left with expresses the laplace transform of the angle equal to the system function the open loop system function times the laplace transform of the combined inputs , Lecture26FeedbackExampleTheInvertedPendulumMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,118,1,0,991.720,6,7,signalprocessing,then the overall expression for the laplace transform of the output angle is as i indicate here namely that theta of s is proportional through this system function , Lecture26FeedbackExampleTheInvertedPendulumMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,119,1,0,1008.170,2,3,signalprocessing,so the laplace transform of the input x of t and let me remind you that x of t the external disturbances now represent the only input since the other input corresponding to the applied acceleration to the cart is now controlled only through the feedback loop , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,9,0,0,129.380,12,13,signalprocessing,later on in the course when we've developed the concept of the fourier transform after that the laplace transform we'll see some very efficient and useful ways of generating solutions both for differential and difference equations , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,272,0,0,2775.560,13,14,signalprocessing,and beginning with the next set of lectures we'll be talking about the fourier transform and much later in the course what's referred to as the laplace transform for continuous time and the z transform for discrete time , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,273,0,0,2790.070,8,9,signalprocessing,and what we'll see is that with the fourier transform and later with the laplace and z transform we'll have a number of efficient and very useful ways of generating the solution for differential and difference equations under the assumption that the system is causal linear and time invariant , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,56,0,0,689.770,19,20,signalprocessing,and the representation that's developed in terms of linear combinations of complex exponentials is what's referred to as the fourier transform , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,294,0,0,3035.520,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier series representation then becomes what we'll refer to the fourier transform , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,296,0,0,3050.140,17,18,signalprocessing,in the next lecture we'll develop this a little more carefully and more fully moving from the fourier series which we've used for periodic signals to develop the fourier transform which will then be representation for aperiodic signals , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,48,0,0,576.900,6,7,signalprocessing,and we have then the corresponding fourier transform analysis equation which tells us how we arrive at that envelope in terms of x of t , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,69,0,0,826.300,8,9,signalprocessing,so what we have then is now our fourier transform representation the continuous time fourier transform with the synthesis equation expressed as an integral as i've indicated here and this integral is what the fourier series sum went to as we let the period go to infinity or the frequency go to zero , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,72,0,0,870.620,12,13,signalprocessing,and in shorthand notation we would think of x of t and fourier transform as a pair as i've indicated here , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,73,0,0,880.380,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier transform as we'll emphasize in several examples and certainly as is consistent with the fourier series is a complex valued function even when x of t is real , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,74,0,0,895.730,11,12,signalprocessing,so with x of t real we end up with a fourier transform which is a complex function , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,77,0,0,912.420,2,3,signalprocessing,express the fourier transform in terms of it's real part and imaginary part or alternatively in terms of its magnitude and its angle , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,78,0,0,928.270,14,15,signalprocessing,all right now let's look at an example of a time function in its fourier transform , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,82,0,0,949.520,1,2,signalprocessing,it's fourier transform is the integral from minus infinity to plus infinity x of t e to the minus j omega t dt , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,86,0,0,998.870,9,10,signalprocessing,and so what we have finally is for the fourier transform expression one over a plus j omega , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,87,0,0,1012.700,2,3,signalprocessing,now this fourier transform as i indicated is a complex valued function , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,89,0,0,1024.210,6,7,signalprocessing,we have the expression for the fourier transform pair e to the minus a t times , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,90,0,0,1032.839,2,3,signalprocessing,and its fourier transform is one over a plus j omega , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,92,0,0,1042.609,42,43,signalprocessing,now in the expression that we just worked out if a is less than zero in fact the expression doesn't converge e to the minus a t for a negative as t goes to infinity blows up and so in fact the fourier transform doesn't converge except for the case where a is greater than zero and in fact there is a more detailed discussion of convergence issues in the text , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,93,0,0,1074.990,10,11,signalprocessing,the convergence issues are very much the same for the fourier transform as they are for the fourier series , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,94,0,0,1080.860,10,11,signalprocessing,and in fact that's not surprising because we developed the fourier transform out of a consideration of the fourier series , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,96,0,0,1102.290,6,7,signalprocessing,ok now if we plot the fourier transform let's first consider the shape of the time function , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,99,0,0,1122.920,4,5,signalprocessing,the magnitude of the fourier transform is as i indicate here and the phase below it , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,100,0,0,1133.970,17,18,signalprocessing,and there are a number of things we can see about the magnitude and phase of the fourier transform for this example which in fact we'll see in the next lecture are properties that apply more generally , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,101,0,0,1150.210,6,7,signalprocessing,for example the fact that the fourier transform magnitude is an even function of frequency and the phase is an odd function of frequency , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,103,0,0,1172.830,8,9,signalprocessing,in other words in our expression for the fourier transform it requires both omega positive and omega negative , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,107,0,0,1214.700,14,15,signalprocessing,so it's important to keep in mind that in our case both with the fourier series and the fourier transform we deal and require both positive and negative frequencies in order to build our signals , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,109,0,0,1240.360,7,8,signalprocessing,and that's one graphical representation for the fourier transform that we'll typically use , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,120,0,0,1330.190,10,11,signalprocessing,and i indicated that there is a symmetry to the fourier transform and so in fact we can infer from this particular picture what it looks like for the negative frequencies as well as for the positive frequencies , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,121,0,0,1349.560,10,11,signalprocessing,now what we've done so far is to develop the fourier transform on the basis the fourier transform of an aperiodic signal on the basis of periodically repeating it and recognizing that the fourier series coefficients are samples of an envelope and that these become more finely spaced as frequency increases , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,123,0,0,1402.920,7,8,signalprocessing,we then defined this envelope as the fourier transform of this aperiodic signal , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,125,0,0,1424.810,22,23,signalprocessing,now suppose that we have instead a periodic signal are there in fact some statements that we can make about how the fourier series coefficients of that are related to the fourier transform of something , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,127,0,0,1447.390,9,10,signalprocessing,what this statement says is that in fact the fourier series coefficients are samples of the fourier transform of one period , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,128,0,0,1459.180,14,15,signalprocessing,so if we now consider a periodic signal we can in fact get the fourier series coefficients of that periodic signal by considering the fourier transform of one period , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,129,0,0,1478.630,4,5,signalprocessing,said another way the fourier series coefficients are proportional to samples of the fourier transform of one period , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,130,0,0,1487.670,10,11,signalprocessing,so if we consider this a periodic signal computed as fourier transform and selected these samples that i indicate here namely samples equally spaced in omega by integer multiples of omega zero then in fact those would be the fourier series coefficients , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,132,0,0,1527.190,25,26,signalprocessing,and now in this case we could argue that if in fact it was the periodic signal that we started with we could get the fourier series coefficients of that by thinking about the fourier transform of one period which i indicate here , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,134,0,0,1564.710,10,11,signalprocessing,all right now we have a way of getting the fourier series coefficients from the fourier transform of one period , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,135,0,0,1574.930,4,5,signalprocessing,we originally derived the fourier transform of one period from the fourier series , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,136,0,0,1581.420,12,13,signalprocessing,what would in fact be nice is if we could incorporate the fourier series and the fourier transform within a common framework , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,138,0,0,1598.040,21,22,signalprocessing,essentially if we consider what the equation for the synthesis looks like in both cases we can in effect define a fourier transform for the periodic signal which we know is represented by its fourier series coefficients , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,139,0,0,1619.360,4,5,signalprocessing,we can define a fourier transform and the definition of the fourier transform is as an impulse train where the coefficients in the impulse train are proportional with a proportionality factor of two pi for a more or less a bookkeeping reason proportional to the fourier series coefficients , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,141,0,0,1650.860,9,10,signalprocessing,specifically here is then the synthesis equation for the fourier transform if we substitute this definition for the fourier transform of the periodic signal into this expression then when we do the appropriate bookkeeping and interchange the order of summation and integration the impulse integrates out to the exponential factor that we want , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,144,0,0,1687.990,24,25,signalprocessing,the two pis take care of each other and what we're left with is the synthesis equation for aperiodic signal in terms of the fourier transform or in terms of its fourier series coefficients , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,148,0,0,1744.790,7,8,signalprocessing,if we simply redefine or define the fourier transform of the periodic signal as an impulse train where the weights of the impulses are two pi times the corresponding fourier series coefficients then this in fact is what we would use as the fourier transform of the periodic signal , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,157,0,0,1845.550,12,13,signalprocessing,and as its period increases that approaches the aperiodic signal and the fourier series of that approaches the fourier transform of the original aperiodic signal , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,159,0,0,1865.700,16,17,signalprocessing,now the second thing that we recognize is that once we have the concept of the fourier transform we can in fact relate the fourier series coefficients to the fourier transform of one period , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,160,0,0,1882.210,23,24,signalprocessing,so the second statement that we made was that if in fact we're trying to represent a periodic signal we can get the fourier series coefficients of that by computing the fourier transform of one period and then samples of that fourier transform are in fact the fourier series coefficients for the periodic signal , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,161,0,0,1913.210,16,17,signalprocessing,then the third step that we took was to inquire as to whether there is a fourier transform that can appropriately be defined for the periodic signal and the mechanism for doing that was to recognize that if we simply defined the fourier transform of the periodic signal as an impulse train where the impulse heights or areas were proportional to the fourier series coefficients then in fact the fourier transform synthesis equation reduced to the fourier series synthesis equation , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,163,0,0,1957.960,1,2,signalprocessing,the fourier transform of that periodic signal defined as an impulse train where the heights or areas of the impulses are proportional to the fourier series coefficients provides us with a mechanism for combining it together the concepts or notation of the fourier series and fourier transform , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,164,0,0,1980.900,27,28,signalprocessing,so if we just took a very simple example here is an example in which we have an aperiodic signal which is just an impulse and its fourier transform is just a constant , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,167,0,0,2012.300,1,2,signalprocessing,the fourier transform of this is a constant , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,169,0,0,2018.970,2,3,signalprocessing,so the fourier transform of the original impulse is just a constant , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,170,0,0,2026.170,1,2,signalprocessing,the fourier transform of the periodic signal is an impulse train where the heights of the impulses are proportional to the fourier series coefficients , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,173,0,0,2059.199,15,16,signalprocessing,and both of these simply represent samples of what we have above which is the fourier transform of the original aperiodic signal , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,175,0,0,2088.810,21,22,signalprocessing,basically what we've tried to do is incorporate within one framework a representation for both aperiodic and periodic signals and the fourier transform provides us with a mechanism to do that , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,176,0,0,2104.410,13,14,signalprocessing,in the next lecture i'll continue with the discussion of the continuous time fourier transform in particular focusing on a number of its properties some of which we've already seen namely the symmetry properties , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,177,0,0,2118.000,13,14,signalprocessing,we'll see lots of other properties that relate of course both to the fourier transform and to the fourier series , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,4,0,0,64.440,5,6,signalprocessing,and this led to the fourier series representation in the periodic case and it led to the fourier transform representation in the aperiodic case , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,5,0,0,74.950,11,12,signalprocessing,and then in fact what we did was to incorporate the fourier series within the framework of the fourier transform , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,85.480,12,13,signalprocessing,what i'd like to do in today's lecture is look at the fourier transform more closely in particular with regard to some of its properties , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,7,0,0,95.050,15,16,signalprocessing,so let me begin by reminding you of the analysis and synthesis equations for the fourier transform as i've summarized them here , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,127.970,25,26,signalprocessing,so essentially in the decomposition of x of t as a linear combination of complex exponentials the complex amplitudes of those are in effect the fourier transform scaled by the differential and scaled by one over two pi , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,146.670,6,7,signalprocessing,as i indicated last time the fourier transform is a complex function of frequency , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,13,0,0,164.770,4,5,signalprocessing,the symmetry of the fourier transform when x of t is real is what is referred to as conjugate symmetric , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,16,0,0,184.930,16,17,signalprocessing,and a consequence of that if we think in terms of the real part of the fourier transform the real part is an even function of frequency and the magnitude is an even function of frequency , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,18,0,0,211.170,25,26,signalprocessing,so we have this symmetry relationship that for x of t real if we think of either the real part or the magnitude of the fourier transform it's even symmetric , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,21,0,0,233.740,18,19,signalprocessing,let's look at an example in the context of an example that we worked last time for the fourier transform , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,23,0,0,251.550,2,3,signalprocessing,and the fourier transform as we found was of the algebraic form one over a plus j omega , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,24,0,0,260.089,3,4,signalprocessing,and incidentally the fourier transform integral only converged for a greater than zero , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,28,0,0,294.050,56,57,signalprocessing,so in fact although i stressed last time that the complex exponentials is required to build a time function require exponentials of both positive and negative frequencies for x of t real what we see is that because of these symmetry properties either for the real and imaginary or magnitude and angle we can specify the fourier transform for let's say only positive frequencies , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,29,0,0,324.630,10,11,signalprocessing,and the symmetry then implies or tells us what the fourier transform then would be for the negative frequencies , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,31,0,0,339.480,9,10,signalprocessing,demonstrates another important and often useful property of the fourier transform , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,33,0,0,354.350,7,8,signalprocessing,so we have again the exponential whose fourier transform is one over a plus j omega , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,38,0,0,401.300,2,3,signalprocessing,whereas its fourier transform or the magnitude of its fourier transform has the inverse property that as a gets smaller in fact this scales down in frequency , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,39,0,0,416.840,8,9,signalprocessing,well this is a general property of the fourier transform namely the fact that a linear scaling in time generates the inverse linear scaling in frequency , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,69,0,0,754.590,24,25,signalprocessing,you can look at the algebra more carefully at your leisure but essentially what this says is that if x of omega is the fourier transform of a time function x of t then in fact x of t is very much like the fourier transform of x of omega , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,70,0,0,780.180,4,5,signalprocessing,in fact it's the fourier transform of x of minus omega to account for this minus sign , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,72,0,0,790.550,24,25,signalprocessing,so the duality relationship which follows from these two equations in fact says that if x of t and x of omega are a fourier transform pair if x and x are a fourier transform pair then x in fact has a fourier transform which is proportional to x turned around , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,73,0,0,815.910,6,7,signalprocessing,this duality in the continuous time fourier transform is very important , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,76,0,0,848.580,21,22,signalprocessing,and we'll see also that in the discrete time case one of the important differences between continuous time and discrete time fourier transforms is the fact that in continuous time we have duality in the discrete time fourier transform we don't , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,78,0,0,872.400,7,8,signalprocessing,here are in fact two examples of fourier transform pairs taken from examples in the text , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,80,0,0,892.310,2,3,signalprocessing,and its fourier transform corresponds to a rectangular shape in the frequency domain , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,82,0,0,911.590,13,14,signalprocessing,and in example four point ten we begin with a rectangle and its fourier transform is of the form of a sine x over x function , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,87,0,0,970.830,14,15,signalprocessing,one thing this says of course is that essentially any time you've calculated the fourier transform of one time function then you've actually calculated the fourier transform of two time functions , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,89,0,0,992.370,17,18,signalprocessing,also somewhat related to duality is what is referred to as parseval's relation for the continuous time fourier transform , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,91,0,0,1007.880,18,19,signalprocessing,as a summary of it says that the energy in a time function and the energy in its fourier transform are proportional the proportionality factor being a factor of two pi , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,95,0,0,1045.770,4,5,signalprocessing,although we've incorporated the fourier series within a framework of the fourier transform parseval's relation needs to be modified slightly for fourier series because of the fact that a periodic signal has an infinite amount of energy in it and essentially that form of parseval's relationship for the periodic case would say infinity equals infinity which isn't too useful , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,102,0,0,1144.600,14,15,signalprocessing,and the time shifting property says if i have a time function with a fourier transform x of omega if i shift that time function in time then that corresponds to multiplying the fourier transform by this factor , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,105,0,0,1201.110,31,32,signalprocessing,another property and in fact a pair of properties that we'll make reference to as we turn our attention toward the end of this lecture to solving differential equations using the fourier transform is what's referred to as the differentiation property and its companion which is the integration property , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,106,0,0,1226.600,12,13,signalprocessing,the differentiation property says again if we have a time function with fourier transform x of omega the fourier transform of the time derivative of that corresponds to multiplying the fourier transform by a linear function of frequency , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,114,0,0,1295.300,47,48,signalprocessing,so the integration property which is the inverse of the differentiation property says that we divide the transform by j omega and then if in fact there was a constant added to x of t we have to account for that by inserting an impulse into the fourier transform , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,115,0,0,1318.220,42,43,signalprocessing,and the final property that i want to draw your attention to on this view graph is the linearity property which is very straightforward to demonstrate from the analysis and synthesis equations which simply says if x one of omega is the fourier transform x one of t and x two of omega is the fourier transform of x two of t then the fourier transform of a linear combination is a linear combination of the fourier transforms , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,116,0,0,1352.700,14,15,signalprocessing,let me emphasize also that these properties for the most part apply both to fourier series and fourier transforms because in fact what we've done is to incorporate the fourier series within the framework of the fourier transform , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,123,0,0,1438.450,10,11,signalprocessing,and what the convolution property tells us is that the fourier transform of the convolution of two time functions is the product of their fourier transforms , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,124,0,0,1459.620,49,50,signalprocessing,so it says for example that if i have a linear time invariant system and i have an input x of t an impulse response h of t and the output of course being the convolution then in fact if i look at this in the frequency domain the fourier transform of the output is the fourier transform of the input times the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,125,0,0,1493.190,15,16,signalprocessing,you can demonstrate this property algebraically by essentially taking the convolution integral and applying the fourier transform and doing the appropriate interchanging of the order of integration et cetera , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,127,0,0,1516.560,10,11,signalprocessing,and the intuitive interpretation stems from the relationship between the fourier transform of the impulse response and what we've referred to as the frequency response , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,131,0,0,1557.510,16,17,signalprocessing,and in fact the expression for the frequency response is identical to the expression for the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,132,0,0,1567.710,8,9,signalprocessing,in other words the frequency response is the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,143,0,0,1721.580,26,27,signalprocessing,and this is a topic that we'll be treating in a considerable amount of detail after we've also gone through a discussion of the discrete time fourier transform in the next several lectures , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,152,0,0,1829.680,8,9,signalprocessing,recall that the differentiation property said that the fourier transform of the differentiated signal is the fourier transform of the original signal multiplied by j omega , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,154,0,0,1852.490,4,5,signalprocessing,in other words the fourier transform of the output is j omega times the fourier transform of the input , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,194,0,0,2230.080,36,37,signalprocessing,and what the modulation property as we'll see when we explore it in more detail tells us is that if we have a signal with a certain spectrum and we multiply by a sinusoidal signal whose fourier transform is a set of impulses then in a frequency domain we convolve , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,197,0,0,2272.960,25,26,signalprocessing,we've seen a number of properties and i indicated sometime earlier when we talked about differential equations that in fact it's the properties of the fourier transform that provide us with a very useful and important mechanism for solving linear constant coefficient differential equations , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,203,0,0,2362.320,37,38,signalprocessing,and it's because of the fact that we're assuming that it's a linear time invariant system that we can describe it in the frequency domain through the convolution property and we can use the properties of the fourier transform , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,207,0,0,2397.080,2,3,signalprocessing,if we fourier transform this entire expression the differentiation property tells us that the fourier transform of the derivative of the output is the fourier transform of the output multiplied by j omega , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,208,0,0,2414.560,7,8,signalprocessing,and linearity will let us write the fourier transform of this as a times y of omega , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,210,0,0,2429.330,6,7,signalprocessing,and x of omega is the fourier transform of x of t , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,213,0,0,2452.980,1,2,signalprocessing,the fourier transform of the output in terms of x of omega , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,214,0,0,2457.420,1,2,signalprocessing,the fourier transform of the input and a simple algebraic step gets us to this expression , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,215,0,0,2465.430,2,3,signalprocessing,so the fourier transform of the output is one over j omega plus a times the fourier transform of the input , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,218,0,0,2487.540,5,6,signalprocessing,well we know that the fourier transform of the output is the fourier transform of the input times the fourier transform of the impulse response of the system namely the frequency response , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,219,0,0,2501.830,16,17,signalprocessing,so in fact if we think of h of t and h of omega as a fourier transform pair it's the convolution property that lets us equate this term with h of omega , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,221,0,0,2526.170,5,6,signalprocessing,so we know what the fourier transform of the impulse response is namely one over j omega plus a , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,224,0,0,2548.690,8,9,signalprocessing,we can attempt to go through the inverse fourier transform expression , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,228,0,0,2571.000,25,26,signalprocessing,so what that says is remember that we worked an example and in fact i showed you the example earlier in the lecture that the fourier transform of e to the minus at times the step is one over j omega plus a , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,232,0,0,2606.940,7,8,signalprocessing,i've drawn graphically the magnitude of the fourier transform here , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,239,0,0,2687.620,13,14,signalprocessing,just to illustrate one additional step in both evaluating inverse transforms and using fourier transform properties to solve linear constant coefficient differential equations let's take the same example and rather than finding the impulse response let's find the response to another exponential input , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,246,0,0,2746.030,3,4,signalprocessing,and again we fourier transform the equation , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,247,0,0,2751.700,6,7,signalprocessing,and we can remember this particular fourier transform pair , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,250,0,0,2765.430,29,30,signalprocessing,and now if we want to determine what the output y of t is we can do that by solving for y of omega and then generating the inverse fourier transform , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,252,0,0,2785.460,5,6,signalprocessing,and this is not a fourier transform that we've worked out before , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,254,0,0,2796.190,5,6,signalprocessing,what we have is a fourier transform which is a product of two terms each of which we can recognize , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,256,0,0,2812.160,8,9,signalprocessing,because of the linearity property associated with the fourier transform the inverse transform is then the sum of the inverse transform of each of those terms , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,259,0,0,2835.440,17,18,signalprocessing,we now have the sum of two terms and if we now recognize by inspection the inverse fourier transform of this we see that it's simply minus e to the minus two t times the unit step , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,263,0,0,2901.110,15,16,signalprocessing,hopefully you're beginning to get some sense now of how powerful and also beautiful the fourier transform is ]

of algebraic manipulations we end up then with the analysis equation , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,78,0,0,875.290,2,3,signalprocessing,and the analysis equation which tells us how to get the coefficients a sub k from x of n is what i've indicated here , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,86,0,0,944.280,2,3,signalprocessing,and the analysis equation was an integration as opposed to the synthesis equation which is a summation , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,89,0,0,976.050,11,12,signalprocessing,so we have then to summarize the synthesis equation and the analysis equation for the discrete time fourier series , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,96,0,0,1022.820,8,9,signalprocessing,and in fact if we look at the analysis equation as we let k vary outside the range from zero to n minus one what you can easily verify by substitution in here is that this sequence will in fact periodically repeat , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,195,0,0,1952.800,5,6,signalprocessing,and we have the corresponding analysis equation which is shown below where this tells us the fourier transform , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,198,0,0,1973.550,4,5,signalprocessing,so we have the analysis equation and synthesis equation , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,226,0,0,2214.670,8,9,signalprocessing,basically if we substitute into the fourier transform analysis equation it's this sum that we evaluate , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,101.310,9,10,signalprocessing,it of course involves a synthesis equation and an analysis equation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,107.040,17,18,signalprocessing,the synthesis equation expressing x of n the sequence in terms of the fourier transform and the analysis equation telling us how to obtain the fourier transform from the original sequence , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,261,0,0,2775.710,4,5,signalprocessing,and we saw an analysis equation which tells us how to get these fourier series coefficients through an integration on the original time function , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,266,0,0,2855.850,7,8,signalprocessing,and we had of course the corresponding analysis equation that told us how to get x of omega , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,15,0,0,176.980,9,10,signalprocessing,and of course associated with this was the corresponding analysis equation that in effect gave us the amplitudes associated with the complex exponentials , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,0,0,105.430,7,8,signalprocessing,and of course there is the corresponding analysis equation , Lecture25FeedbackMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,290,0,0,2602.800,11,12,signalprocessing,ok so what we've seen in today's lecture is the basic analysis equation and a few of the applications , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,117,0,0,1400.540,12,13,signalprocessing,so that in effect then is what we refer to as the analysis equation the equation that begins with x t and tells us how to get the fourier series coefficients , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,120,0,0,1433.070,3,4,signalprocessing,we have the analysis equation which is the equation that we just developed , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,0,0,123.090,15,16,signalprocessing,then the other side of the fourier series is what i referred to as the analysis equation , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,130.380,2,3,signalprocessing,and the analysis equation was the equation that told us how we get the fourier series coefficients from x of t , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,26,0,0,304.370,2,3,signalprocessing,and the analysis equation tells us what the relationship is for the coefficients in terms of the periodic signal , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,38,0,0,443.770,8,9,signalprocessing,and that in effect will correspond to an analysis equation to represent the aperiodic signal , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,48,0,0,576.900,8,9,signalprocessing,and we have then the corresponding fourier transform analysis equation which tells us how we arrive at that envelope in terms of x of t , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,49,0,0,589.930,5,6,signalprocessing,so we now have an analysis equation and a synthesis equation which in effect expresses for us how to build x of t in terms of infinitesimally finely spaced complex exponentials , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,70,0,0,854.720,2,3,signalprocessing,the corresponding analysis equation which we have here , Lecture8ContinuousTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,71,0,0,859.080,1,2,signalprocessing,the analysis equation being the expression for the envelope of the fourier series coefficients for the periodically replicated signal , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,0,0,117.060,2,3,signalprocessing,and the analysis equation telling us how to get the amplitudes of those complex exponentials from the associated time function , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,68,0,0,723.790,15,16,signalprocessing,in particular if we look at the synthesis equation which i repeat here and the analysis equation which i repeat below it what we observe is that in fact these equations are basically identical except for the fact that in the top integral we have things as a function of omega in the bottom integral as a function of t and there's a factor of one over two pi and by the way a minus sign ]

Keyword = [Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,5,0,0,72.280,19,20,signalprocessing,and also as we'll see as these lectures go along a particular form of modulation referred to as pulse amplitude modulation and eventually impulse modulation or impulse train modulation forms a very important bridge between continuous time signals and discrete time signals , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,0,0,124.730,18,19,signalprocessing,and what that leads to is a notion which we'll develop in some detail referred to as sinusoidal amplitude modulation and would correspond to a sinusoidal signal referred to as the carrier and it's amplitude being varied on the basis of another signal , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,23,0,0,294.670,15,16,signalprocessing,and what we'll see in particular as we go through today's lecture is that sinusoidal amplitude modulation follows in a fairly straightforward way from the properties of the fourier transform that we've developed in some of the earlier lectures , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,24,0,0,316.920,10,11,signalprocessing,so our focus in today's lecture will be on sinusoidal amplitude modulation in continuous time , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,25,0,0,326.580,23,24,signalprocessing,in the next lecture we'll consider the same set of notions related to discrete time and also a concept referred to as pulse amplitude modulation , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,30,0,0,364.060,14,15,signalprocessing,so what i'd like to do is focus for now on the concept of amplitude modulation , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,32,0,0,383.460,5,6,signalprocessing,the basic structure for an amplitude modulation system is one in which there is the modulating signal let's say for example voice and a carrier signal what's referred to as the carrier , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,35,0,0,420.550,19,20,signalprocessing,and it's this basic property or equation that lets us analyze in some detail in fact the notions of amplitude modulation , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,38,0,0,444.910,11,12,signalprocessing,and that leads to among other things the concept of pulse amplitude modulation , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,43,0,0,484.900,7,8,signalprocessing,so let's first begin the discussion of amplitude modulation by considering a complex exponential carrier and then moving on to a discussion of a sinusoidal carrier , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,106,0,0,983.540,7,8,signalprocessing,now there are lots of applications of amplitude modulation , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,229,0,0,2086.020,4,5,signalprocessing,now the kind of amplitude modulation that i've talked about so far is what's referred to as synchronous modulation , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,254,0,0,2337.760,7,8,signalprocessing,now recall that what we've done in amplitude modulation is to take the carrier signal and vary its amplitude with the signal that eventually we want to get back , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,313,0,0,2831.900,12,13,signalprocessing,there also is a somewhat different issue related to inefficiency in sinusoidal amplitude modulation , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,318,0,0,2865.960,4,5,signalprocessing,and in a sinusoidal amplitude modulation system we would center it around plus and minus the carrier frequency , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,349,0,0,3129.030,29,30,signalprocessing,it's important to recognize and to be somewhat pleased by the fact that not only with the mathematical foundations that we've developed can we understand the basics of sinusoidal amplitude modulation , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,352,0,0,3185.000,22,23,signalprocessing,and as we'll see the next lecture very much the same kinds of notions apply for discrete time sinusoidal and complex exponential amplitude modulation , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,353,0,0,3199.000,24,25,signalprocessing,and also as i indicated at the beginning of the lecture in the next lecture we'll also talk about what's referred to as pulse amplitude modulation , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,96.510,13,14,signalprocessing,over to the right is a device that will allow us to study amplitude modulation and the various flavors of it , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,22,1,0,158.550,9,10,signalprocessing,and we'll be using that actually when we demonstrate amplitude modulation , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,203,1,0,1224.170,8,9,signalprocessing,well as we've discussed in a previous lecture amplitude modulation basically consists of multiplying the modulating signal by an appropriate carrier illustrated here as we've seen previously for the case of a sinusoidal carrier , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,204,1,0,1241.870,5,6,signalprocessing,and then specifically for sinusoidal amplitude modulation we may or may not inject some carrier signal , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,226,1,0,1422.100,18,19,signalprocessing,well sandy maybe to begin you can just point out what some of the controls are on the modulator box , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,287,1,0,1711.190,6,7,signalprocessing,and let's do that on the modulator box , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,123.260,28,29,signalprocessing,and the second is the introduction and analysis of another kind of carriers specifically a pulse kind of carrier in continuous time leading to the notions of pulse amplitude modulation and eventually a very powerful theorem and result called the sampling theorem , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,73,0,0,973.110,20,21,signalprocessing,ok now there is another application that we have discussed for both continuous time and actually previously for discrete time amplitude modulation with sinusoidal complex exponential carriers , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,89,0,0,1259.130,19,20,signalprocessing,ok well so what we've done so far for continuous time and discrete time is to talk about modulation amplitude modulation with complex exponential and sinusoidal carriers , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,98,0,0,1347.030,28,29,signalprocessing,so what we have now is a modulated signal that is a chopped or sliced version of the original waveform and that is what's referred to as pulse amplitude modulation , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,107,0,0,1425.010,44,45,signalprocessing,first just comment very briefly that all of the analysis we go through as has been true in the case of sinusoidal modulation all of the analysis then we go through holds just as well with essentially minor analytical modifications to discrete time pulse amplitude modulation as it does to continuous time pulse amplitude modulation , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,172,0,0,2176.430,13,14,signalprocessing,and that would be true also in a more general case of pulse amplitude modulation with pulses of non zero width , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,187,0,0,2384.410,9,10,signalprocessing,we ended the discussion by talking about first pulse amplitude modulation and then showing how under the right set of conditions you can in fact take a wave form and sample it with a set of instantaneous samples , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,193,0,0,2214.390,15,16,signalprocessing,the modulation property as i've summarized it here in fact is the entire basis for

Keyword = [Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,62,0,0,646.470,7,9,signalprocessing,but i'd now like to turn to discrete time sinusoids , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,63,0,0,651.720,5,7,signalprocessing,what we'll see is that discrete time sinusoids are very much like continuous time ones but also with some very important differences , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,68,0,0,699.820,5,8,signalprocessing,and i've illustrated here several discrete time sinusoidal signals , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,108,0,0,1031.839,10,12,signalprocessing,now one of the things i've said so far about discrete time sinusoids is that a time shift corresponds to a phase change , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,164,0,0,1467.180,13,16,signalprocessing,well we've seen then some important distinctions between continuous time sinusoidal signals and discrete time sinusoidal signals , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,178,0,0,1629.670,12,15,signalprocessing,and the statement that i'm making is that if i have two discrete time sinusoidal signals at two different frequencies and if these frequencies are separated by an integer multiple of two pi namely if omega two is equal to omega one point two pi times an integer m when i substitute this into this expression because of the fact that n is also an integer i'll have m n as an integer multiple of two pi ]

Keyword = [Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,297,0,0,2999.950,7,7,signalprocessing,and then beyond that the concepts of filtering and modulation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,78,0,0,887.230,24,24,signalprocessing,now what we saw in continuous time is that this interpretation and the convolution property led to an important concept namely the concept of filtering , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,81,0,0,923.160,13,13,signalprocessing,so again just as in continuous time we can talk about an ideal filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,82,0,0,932.130,13,13,signalprocessing,and what i show here is the frequency response of an ideal lowpass filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,83,0,0,939.990,3,3,signalprocessing,the ideal lowpass filter of course passes exactly with a gain of one frequencies around zero and eliminates totally other frequencies , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,84,0,0,955.030,25,25,signalprocessing,however an important distinction here between continuous time and discrete time is the fact that whereas in continuous time when we talked about an ideal filter we passed a band of frequencies and totally eliminated everything else out to infinity , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,86,0,0,978.210,11,11,signalprocessing,so obviously the frequency response must periodically repeat for the lowpass filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,88,0,0,986.700,6,6,signalprocessing,if we look at the lowpass filter then we've eliminated some frequencies , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,91,0,0,1019.670,3,3,signalprocessing,so it's lowpass filtering interpreted in terms of frequencies over a range from minus pi to pi , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,92,0,0,1029.180,8,8,signalprocessing,well just as we talk about a lowpass filter we can also talk about a highpass filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,93,0,0,1035.609,3,3,signalprocessing,and a highpass filter of course would pass high frequencies , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,98,0,0,1065.400,9,9,signalprocessing,if we think in the context of the lowpass filter these are low frequencies , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,101,0,0,1089.030,6,6,signalprocessing,in particular then an ideal highpass filter in the discrete time case would be a filter that eliminates these frequencies and passes frequencies around pi , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,102,0,0,1103.620,13,13,signalprocessing,ok so we've seen the convolution property and its interpretation in terms of filtering , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,134,0,0,1412.140,33,33,signalprocessing,and one of the things that we notice and this is drawn for a positive between zero and one what we notice in fact is that it is an approximation to a lowpass filter because it tends to attenuate the high frequencies and retain and in fact amplify the low frequencies , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,137,0,0,1452.980,8,8,signalprocessing,and that becomes an approximation to a highpass filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,138,0,0,1459.790,28,28,signalprocessing,so in fact a first order difference equation as we see has a frequency response depending on the value of a that either looks approximately like a lowpass filter for a positive or a highpass filter for a negative very much like the first order differential equation looked like a lowpass filter in the continuous time case , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,139,0,0,1483.710,10,10,signalprocessing,and in fact what i'd like to illustrate is the filtering characteristics or an example of filtering using a first order difference equation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,140,0,0,1495.600,8,8,signalprocessing,and the example that i'll illustrate is a filtering of a sequence that in fact is filtered very often for very practical reasons namely a sequence which represents the dow jones industrial average over a fairly long period , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,144,0,0,1548.270,17,17,signalprocessing,so let's watch the filtering first with a positive and we'll see it behave as a lowpass filter and then with a negative and we'll see the difference equation behaving as a highpass filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,154,0,0,1653.180,7,7,signalprocessing,correspondingly we'll get more and more lowpass filtering as the coefficient a increases from zero toward one , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,158,0,0,1682.480,13,13,signalprocessing,and in fact i'm sure there are many people who wish that through filtering we could in fact have avoided the stock market crash altogether , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,160,0,0,1699.490,12,12,signalprocessing,and as we do that we will be taking out the lowpass filtering , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,161,0,0,1705.930,11,11,signalprocessing,and when a finally reaches zero the impulse response of the filter will again be an impulse and so the output will be once again identical to the input , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,164,0,0,1731.160,13,13,signalprocessing,and what we will see in that case is more and more highpass filtering on the output in relation to the input , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,167,0,0,1758.740,25,25,signalprocessing,we see that the high frequencies or rapid variations are emphasized and finally let's move from minus one back towards zero taking out the highpass filtering and ending up with a equal to zero corresponding to an impulse response which is an impulse in other words an identity system , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,169,0,0,1799.650,14,14,signalprocessing,ok so we see that in fact a first order difference equation is a filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,171,0,0,1810.270,11,11,signalprocessing,and it's used very often to do approximate lowpass and highpass filtering , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,231,0,0,2443.060,19,19,signalprocessing,now it's interesting that what that says is that if we have a system which corresponds to a lowpass filter as i indicate here with an impulse response h of n , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,232,0,0,2463.320,9,9,signalprocessing,and it can be any approximation to a lowpass filter and even an ideal lowpass filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,233,0,0,2469.860,9,9,signalprocessing,if we want to convert that to a highpass filter we can do that by generating a new system whose impulse response is minus one to the n times the impulse response of the lowpass filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,235,0,0,2504.600,12,12,signalprocessing,this also says incidentally that if we look at an ideal lowpass filter and an ideal highpass filter and we choose the cutoff frequencies for comparison or the bandwidth of the filter to be equal , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,236,0,0,2524.650,4,4,signalprocessing,since this ideal highpass filter is this ideal lowpass filter with the frequency response shifted by pi the modulation property tells us that in the time domain what that corresponds to is an impulse response multiplied by minus one to the n , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,237,0,0,2546.950,10,10,signalprocessing,so it says that the impulse response of the highpass filter or equivalently the inverse fourier transform of the highpass filter frequency response is minus one to the n times the impulse response for the lowpass filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,240,0,0,2571.710,11,11,signalprocessing,that modulation can be used to implement or convert from lowpass filtering to highpass filtering , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,244,0,0,2604.520,11,11,signalprocessing,suppose we have a system that we know is a lowpass filter and it's a good lowpass filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,245,0,0,2611.410,8,8,signalprocessing,how might we use it as a highpass filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,246,0,0,2614.800,51,51,signalprocessing,well one way to do it instead of shifting its frequency response is to take the original signal shift its low frequencies to high frequencies and its high frequencies to low frequencies by multiplying the input signal the original signal by minus one to the n process that with a lowpass filter where now what's sitting at the low frequencies were the high frequencies , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,249,0,0,2650.060,10,10,signalprocessing,let's suppose for example that this system was a lowpass filter and so it lowpass filters whatever comes into it , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,251,0,0,2672.460,3,3,signalprocessing,doing the lowpass filtering which , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,253,0,0,2679.990,5,5,signalprocessing,and then after the lowpass filtering moving the frequencies back where they belong by again modulating with minus one to the n , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,254,0,0,2688.560,17,17,signalprocessing,and that in fact turns out to be a very useful notion for applying a fixed lowpass filter to do highpass filtering and vice versa , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,312,0,0,3309.950,14,14,signalprocessing,we've also shown that the convolution property leads to a very important concept namely filtering , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,315,0,0,3335.000,12,12,signalprocessing,in the next several lectures we'll focus in more specifically first on filtering and then on modulation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,316,0,0,3342.570,5,5,signalprocessing,and as we'll see the filtering and modulation concepts form really the cornerstone of many many signal processing ideas , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,82.260,14,14,signalprocessing,in today's lecture though i'd like to review and expand on the notion of filtering which as i had mentioned flows more or less directly from the convolution property , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,0,0,119.190,26,26,signalprocessing,now what this means in terms of linear time invariant filters since we know that in the time domain the output of a linear time invariant filter is the convolution of the input and the impulse response it says essentially then in the frequency domain that the fourier transform of the output is the product the fourier transform of the impulse response namely the frequency response and the fourier transform of the input , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,13,0,0,185.320,7,7,signalprocessing,now this led to the notion of filtering where the basic concept was that since we can modify the amplitudes of each of the complex exponential components separately we can for example retain some of them and totally eliminate others , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,14,0,0,205.040,7,7,signalprocessing,and this is the basic notion of filtering , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,15,0,0,207.810,17,17,signalprocessing,so we have as you recall first of all the notion in continuous time of an ideal filter for example i illustrate here an ideal lowpass filter where we pass exactly frequency components in one band and reject totally frequency components in another band , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,17,0,0,240.030,5,5,signalprocessing,i illustrated here a lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,19,0,0,248.930,8,8,signalprocessing,and that then corresponds to an ideal highpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,21,0,0,257.810,13,13,signalprocessing,and so i show below what is referred to commonly as a bandpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,24,0,0,275.200,8,8,signalprocessing,namely we have an ideal discrete time lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,27,0,0,292.260,6,6,signalprocessing,we show also an ideal highpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,28,0,0,296.630,3,3,signalprocessing,and a highpass filter as i indicated last time passes frequencies around pi , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,29,0,0,302.740,9,9,signalprocessing,and finally below that i show an ideal bandpass filter passing frequencies someplace in the range between zero and pi , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,31,0,0,329.960,13,13,signalprocessing,now let's look at these ideal filters and in particular the ideal lowpass filter in the time domain , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,32,0,0,339.320,9,9,signalprocessing,we have the frequency response of the ideal lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,34,0,0,349.580,16,16,signalprocessing,so here is the frequency response and below it the impulse response of the ideal lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,37,0,0,379.150,19,19,signalprocessing,and notice also since i want to refer back to this that the impulse response of an ideal lowpass filter in fact is non causal , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,40,0,0,401.680,8,8,signalprocessing,so the impulse response of the ideal lowpass filter is symmetric and continues to have tails off to plus and minus infinity , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,42,0,0,419.610,16,16,signalprocessing,let's look at the frequency response and associated impulse response for an ideal discrete time lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,43,0,0,428.200,12,12,signalprocessing,so once again here is the frequency response of the ideal lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,52,0,0,499.010,7,7,signalprocessing,on the other hand there are many filtering problems in which generally we don't have a sharp distinction between the frequencies we want to pass and the frequencies we want to reject , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,53,0,0,511.260,27,27,signalprocessing,one example of this that's elaborated on in the text is the design of an automotive suspension system which in fact is the design of a lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,54,0,0,522.490,13,13,signalprocessing,and basically what you want to do in a case like that is filter out or attenuate very rapid road variations and keep the lower variations in of course elevation of the highway or road , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,57,0,0,564.300,9,9,signalprocessing,for example let's look back at the ideal lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,60,0,0,577.090,13,13,signalprocessing,let's now look at the step response of the discrete time ideal lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,64,0,0,599.100,12,12,signalprocessing,let's look at the step response of the continuous time ideal lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,69,0,0,641.790,22,22,signalprocessing,we can see either in continuous time or discrete time which is that even if we want it to have an ideal filter the ideal filter has another problem if we want to attempt to implement it in real time , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,72,0,0,670.190,9,9,signalprocessing,so if in fact we want to build a filter and the filter is restricted to operate in real time then in fact we can't build an ideal filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,73,0,0,683.920,38,38,signalprocessing,so what that says is that in practice although ideal filters are nice to think about and perhaps relate to practical problems more typically what we consider are nonideal filters and in the discrete time case a nonideal filter then we would have a characteristic somewhat like i've indicated here , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,82,0,0,786.280,10,10,signalprocessing,even if causality is not an issue what happens in filter design and implementation in fact is that the sharper you attempt to make the cutoff the more expensive in some sense the filter becomes either in terms of components in continuous time or in terms of computation in discrete time , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,84,0,0,821.790,22,22,signalprocessing,now just to illustrate as an example let me remind you of one example of what in fact is a nonideal lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,98,0,0,981.430,17,17,signalprocessing,and as you can see and as we saw last time is an approximation to a lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,99,0,0,987.630,7,7,signalprocessing,it is in fact and nonideal lowpass filter whereas the resistor output is an approximation to a highpass filter or in effect a nonideal highpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,100,0,0,1002.200,12,12,signalprocessing,so in one case just comparing the two we have a lowpass filter as the capacitor output associated with the capacitor output and a highpass filter associated with the resistor output , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,107,0,0,1085.550,14,14,signalprocessing,and if we consider either one of these looking back again at the lowpass filter if we were to cascade several filters with this frequency response then because we have things plotted on a bode plot the bode plot for the cascade would simply be summing these , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,119,0,0,1215.280,8,8,signalprocessing,and what we have in the way of filtering is first of all , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,127,0,0,1287.090,9,9,signalprocessing,so you can change the overall shaping of the filter by moving the switches up and down , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,130,0,0,1298.480,6,6,signalprocessing,and now i put in this filtering characteristic , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,131,0,0,1302.000,7,7,signalprocessing,and what i'd like to demonstrate is filtering with this when we do things that are a little more dramatic than what would normally be done in a typical audio recording setting , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,137,0,0,1338.430,10,10,signalprocessing,and so now what we have effectively is a lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,138,0,0,1343.940,5,5,signalprocessing,and now with the lowpass filter let me now bring the highs back up , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,154,0,0,1450.310,20,20,signalprocessing,there are also with each of the filters a selector switch that lets us adjust the center frequency of the filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,161,0,0,1481.820,12,12,signalprocessing,but before i do let me draw your attention to one other filter which is this white switch , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,162,0,0,1489.660,6,6,signalprocessing,and this switch is a highpass filter that essentially cuts out frequencies below about one hundred cycles , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,189,0,0,1673.280,11,11,signalprocessing,one class is referred to a non recursive or moving average filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,190,0,0,1680.930,8,8,signalprocessing,and the basic idea with a moving average filter is something that perhaps you're somewhat familiar with intuitively , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,204,0,0,1821.410,17,17,signalprocessing,and in fact it's easy to verify that this indeed corresponds to the impulse response of the filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,211,0,0,1872.300,12,12,signalprocessing,and as you can see that is some approximation to a lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,212,0,0,1878.860,15,15,signalprocessing,and so this again is the impulse response and frequency response of a nonideal lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,214,0,0,1906.510,22,22,signalprocessing,let me just show the result of choosing the weights for the design of a two hundred fifty one point moving average filter where the weights are chosen using an optimum algorithm to generate as sharp a cutoff as can possibly be generated , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,215,0,0,1926.070,13,13,signalprocessing,and so what i show here is the frequency response of the resulting filter on a logarithmic amplitude scale and a linear frequency scale , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,221,0,0,1963.770,8,8,signalprocessing,now the notion of a moving average for filtering is something that is very commonly used , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,222,0,0,1973.010,10,10,signalprocessing,i had shown last time actually the result of some filtering on a particular data sequence the dow jones industrial average , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,227,0,0,2026.940,15,15,signalprocessing,and let me now show you what the result of filtering with a moving average filter would look like on the same dow jones industrial average sequence that i showed last time , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,237,0,0,2091.690,9,9,signalprocessing,now let's increase the length of the moving average filter much more rapidly and watch how the output is more and more smooth in relation to the input , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,239,0,0,2116.450,7,7,signalprocessing,and once again through the magic of filtering we've been able to eliminate the one thousand nine hundred twenty nine stock market crash , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,247,0,0,2198.610,14,14,signalprocessing,for example just to interpret this focus on the interpretation of this as a filter let's look at a first order difference equation which we've talked about and generated the solution to previously , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,251,0,0,2240.970,22,22,signalprocessing,but what we want to examine now for this first order recursion is the frequency response and see its interpretation as a filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,260,0,0,2336.990,18,18,signalprocessing,and recall that depending on whether the factor a is positive or negative we either get a lowpass filter or a highpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,261,0,0,2347.840,27,27,signalprocessing,and if in fact we look at the frequency response for the factor a being positive then we see that this is an approximation to a lowpass filter whereas below it i show the frequency response for a negative , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,262,0,0,2366.390,7,7,signalprocessing,and there this corresponds to a highpass filter because we're attenuating low frequencies and retaining the high frequencies , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,263,0,0,2379.350,13,13,signalprocessing,and recall also that we illustrated this characteristic as a lowpass or highpass filter for the first order recursion by looking at how it worked as a filter in both cases when the input was the dow jones average , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,264,0,0,2399.030,11,11,signalprocessing,and indeed we saw that it generated both lowpass and highpass filtering in the appropriate cases , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,267,0,0,2421.390,9,9,signalprocessing,basically what happens is that for the moving average filter for a given set a filter specifications there are many more multiplications required than for a recursive filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,268,0,0,2433.190,15,15,signalprocessing,but there are in certain contexts some very important compensating benefits for the moving average filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,269,0,0,2441.450,13,13,signalprocessing,now this concludes pretty much what i want to say in detail about filtering the concept of filtering in the set of lectures , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,271,0,0,2465.250,14,14,signalprocessing,as the lectures go on what we'll find is that the basic concept of filtering both ideal and nonideal filtering will be a very important part of what we do , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,273,0,0,2495.340,38,38,signalprocessing,and what we'll find when we do that is that a very important part of that discussion and in fact a very important part of the use of modulation also just naturally incorporates the concept and properties of filtering , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,110,0,0,1009.540,21,21,signalprocessing,and that is the notion of using modulation to permit the application of a very well designed and implemented low pass filter to be used as a band pass filter and in fact as a set of band pass filters , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,112,0,0,1031.680,8,8,signalprocessing,the idea is if we have a fixed filter let's say we have a signal , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,113,0,0,1039.990,7,7,signalprocessing,and we want to think of a filter which we want to move along the signal one way to do it is to somehow have filters that move along the signal , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,114,0,0,1050.950,7,7,signalprocessing,the other possibility is to keep the filter fixed and let the signal move in frequency in front of the filter , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,118,0,0,1076.490,12,12,signalprocessing,and the output of that is then processed with a low pass filter and then we demodulate the result , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,122,0,0,1129.530,13,13,signalprocessing,and the dotted line corresponds to the pass band of the low pass filter , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,123,0,0,1135.430,6,6,signalprocessing,well the result of low pass filtering rejects all the spectrum except the part around low frequencies , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,128,0,0,1171.140,19,19,signalprocessing,if we can look back at the top spectrum this is equivalent to having extracted with a band pass filter a section out of this part of the spectrum , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,129,0,0,1183.860,32,32,signalprocessing,so in terms of tracking through the spectrum and looking at the equivalent filtering operation then what we accomplished was to pull out this part of the spectrum using a low pass filter and modulation , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,130,0,0,1203.950,9,9,signalprocessing,but equivalently what we implemented was a band pass filter as i indicated here , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,132,0,0,1220.620,2,2,signalprocessing,equivalently this filter doesn't correspond to a filter whose impulse response is real , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,134,0,0,1243.080,3,3,signalprocessing,and the equivalent filter that we would end up with then is the filter that i indicate at the bottom which is a band pass filter , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,137,0,0,1263.860,7,7,signalprocessing,why not just build a band pass filter , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,138,0,0,1266.520,15,15,signalprocessing,and one of the reasons is that it's often much easier to build a fixed filter a filter with a fixed center frequency for example a low pass filter than it is to build a filter that has variable components in it so that when you vary them the filter's center frequency shifts around , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,140,0,0,1297.660,23,23,signalprocessing,and so the idea here which is really the basis for many spectrum analyzers is to build a really good quality low pass filter and then use modulation which is often easier to implement , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,141,0,0,1311.260,11,11,signalprocessing,use modulation to shift the signal essentially in front of the filter , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,181,0,0,1647.990,2,2,signalprocessing,that's called filtering , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,182,0,0,1649.320,15,15,signalprocessing,so what we would do is put the result of this through a low pass filter , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,183,0,0,1657.035,3,3,signalprocessing,the low pass filter route would retain the part of the spectrum around dc and eliminate the remaining part of the spectrum , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,194,0,0,1751.870,9,9,signalprocessing,we need to process that with a low pass filter that extracts the part of the spectrum around dc and throws away the upper part of the spectrum that gets generated in the second modulation process , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,216,0,0,1956.890,11,11,signalprocessing,and as you can see essentially by doing appropriate band pass filtering we can pull out whatever part of the spectrum we choose to and then demodulate that in the appropriate way , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,222,0,0,2011.060,12,12,signalprocessing,demultiplexing corresponding to pulling out the appropriate channel with a band pass filter , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,225,0,0,2032.340,15,15,signalprocessing,and the demodulation of course involves multiplying by the carrier and doing appropriate low pass filtering to finally get the signal back , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,228,0,0,2069.760,25,25,signalprocessing,and of course you can see that not only is modulation an important part of that but as i alluded to in the last lecture filtering also becomes important part of these practical systems , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,241,0,0,2211.280,22,22,signalprocessing,and if you track through the details and the algebra then what you'll find is that the output of the low pass filter rather than being x of t the signal that we want is x of t multiplied by a scale factor , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,337,0,0,3027.690,13,13,signalprocessing,the simplest way at least conceptually is to think about doing it with filtering , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,339,0,0,3041.810,12,12,signalprocessing,and if that modulated signal is simply put through a high pass filter then the result will be to eliminate the lower sideband if we choose the high pass filter to have a characteristic as i indicate here , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,340,0,0,3059.530,8,8,signalprocessing,so this conceptually is a very sharp cutoff filter , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,345,0,0,3082.180,28,28,signalprocessing,it's clearly more efficient than double sideband transmission but also has the complication or additional issue that the modulator becomes a little more complicated because you need this filtering operation or some equivalent operation to get rid of the unwanted sideband , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,95,1,0,518.929,16,16,signalprocessing,so the overall system block diagram first consists of a system which is a low pass filter , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,96,1,0,528.280,4,4,signalprocessing,and this low pass filter is used in advance of the sampling process to basically reduce the artifacts that are introduced due to sampling , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,98,1,0,559.990,4,4,signalprocessing,so this low pass filter is referred to and will be in later lectures as an anti aliasing filter , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,284,0,0,1695.380,4,4,signalprocessing,and then you simply filter out the higher order harmonics , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,56,0,0,693.010,34,34,signalprocessing,and as long as the carrier frequency is large enough compared with the width of the original signal then as you can see by extracting this part of the spectrum with a low pass filter we can in principle recover the spectrum associated with the original signal , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,57,0,0,714.810,24,24,signalprocessing,and again just as in continuous time because this amplitude is a half we would want to choose for scaling purposes a low pass filter amplitude which is two to compensate for this factor of a half , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,60,0,0,748.010,24,24,signalprocessing,and we have the demodulator which consists of taking a modulated signal multiplying by the carrier and then processing that with a low pass filter to extract the portion of the spectrum which is around zero frequency as i indicate in the spectrum below and the result then that this low pass filter having a gain of two is that we've recovered the original spectrum x of omega which is the spectrum that we started with , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,75,0,0,996.980,15,15,signalprocessing,and that is the notion of using modulation together with fixed filtering to implement a filter which either has a variable cut off or converts let's say a low pass filter to a high pass filter , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,76,0,0,1014.580,20,20,signalprocessing,we had originally talked about this when we introduce the modulation property in the context of converting a low pass filter to a high pass filter , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,78,0,0,1048.000,11,11,signalprocessing,and if after modulation that is processed with a low pass filter and then the result is demodulated using exactly the same carrier namely a carrier which is minus one to the n then the effect of that is equivalent to high pass filtering on the original signal , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,80,0,0,1096.590,38,38,signalprocessing,and as i've represented it here and as we had talked about it when we talked about the modulation property for discrete time signals we had specifically chosen the conversion of a low pass to a high pass filter , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,83,0,0,1173.900,9,9,signalprocessing,well if that's processed now with a low pass filter and this dashed line indicates the low pass filter then the result that we get is shown here where we've extracted the low frequency portion of the modulated signal , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,86,0,0,1208.780,40,40,signalprocessing,so if we just compare this spectrum with the original spectrum at the top what we can see is that in effect what we've done is to extract a portion of the spectrum equivalent to processing with a high pass filter , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,126,0,0,1585.530,48,48,signalprocessing,and as long as the frequency of the pulse train is large enough compared with the maximum frequency in the original signal x of t so that there's no overlap between these triangles then what you can see in fact somewhat amazingly is that simply by low pass filtering the result we can get back except for amplitude factor we can get back to the original signal , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,137,0,0,1734.920,25,25,signalprocessing,and then as long as the frequency of the impulse train was such that i was able to do this reconstruction by simply low pass filtering then i would be able to demodulate , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,169,0,0,2121.130,37,37,signalprocessing,and as long as the frequency of the impulse train is large enough compared with the bandwidth of the signal so that these triangles don't overlap i can extract this portion of the spectrum by low pass filtering in fact would then give us back the original signal , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,175,0,0,2202.090,32,32,signalprocessing,but going back to the case in which we've chosen the frequency of the impulse train high enough then we would recover the original signal by processing it through a low pass filter , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,176,0,0,2220.050,34,34,signalprocessing,and in that case what this says is that if we have a signal and we modulate it with an impulse train if we then process that impulse train through an idea low pass filter given the right conditions on the frequency of impulse train and the bandwidth of the signal we can recover the original signal back again , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,183,0,0,2333.890,9,9,signalprocessing,and when that is processed through a low pass filter to extract this part of the spectrum then after the low pass filter we can recover the original signal back again , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,189,0,0,2414.280,73,73,signalprocessing,what in fact the formal statement that is is refer to as the sampling theorem a very powerful theorem that says if we're given equally spaced samples of a time function and if that time function is band limited and if the bandwidth and if the sampling frequency is chosen in the right way in relation to the bandwidth then in fact the original time function is uniquely recoverable with a low pass filter , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,20,1,0,295.750,35,35,signalprocessing,and then as you recall to recover the original time function from this as long as these individual triangles don't overlap to recover it just simply involves passing the impulse train through a low pass filter in effect extracting just one of these replications of the original spectrum , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,24,1,0,364.460,31,31,signalprocessing,and then finally to recover the original signal or to generate a reconstructed signal we then multiply this in the frequency domain by the frequency response of an ideal low pass filter , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,26,1,0,388.290,48,48,signalprocessing,now in this picture an important point that i raised last time relates to the fact that in doing the reconstruction well we've assumed is that in replicating these individual versions of the original signal those replications don't overlap and so by passing this through a low pass filter in fact we can recover the original signal , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,33,1,0,464.840,24,24,signalprocessing,in particular if we look back at our original example we are here we were able to recover our original spectrum by low pass filtering , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,35,1,0,504.500,14,14,signalprocessing,as you can see if we try to pass this through a low pass filter to recover the original signal in fact we won't recover the original signal since these individual replications have overlapped , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,39,1,0,539.880,8,8,signalprocessing,what would come out of the low pass filter is the reflection of some higher frequencies into lower frequencies , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,51,1,0,646.620,11,11,signalprocessing,we then carry out a reconstruction with an ideal low pass filter , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,52,1,0,652.490,5,5,signalprocessing,and the ideal low pass filter is set at half the sampling frequency or five kilohertz , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,54,1,0,669.840,12,12,signalprocessing,and then the reconstructed signal is the output from the low pass filter which i denote as x of r of t , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,60,1,0,720.650,13,13,signalprocessing,the replication of the negative frequency has crossed into the passband of the filter and the reconstructed sinusoid will now be the frequency associated with this impulse rather than the frequency associated with the original sinusoid , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,61,1,0,740.520,30,30,signalprocessing,and to dramatize that even further here is the example where now the input frequency has moved up close to ten kilohertz but what comes out of the low pass filter is a much lower frequency , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,64,1,0,776.910,16,16,signalprocessing,and what we'll see is the effect of reconstructing from the samples using a low pass filter for an input which changes in frequency and with a sampling rate of ten kilohertz , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,71,1,0,849.260,13,13,signalprocessing,now for the reconstruction we passed the samples through an ideal low pass filter , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,72,1,0,854.690,9,9,signalprocessing,i picked the cutoff frequency of the low pass filter at half the sampling frequency namely five kilohertz , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,75,1,0,884.480,28,28,signalprocessing,at that point we have aliasing and while the input frequency is increasing the output frequency in fact is decreasing because that's what's inside the passband of the filter , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,81,1,0,935.900,14,14,signalprocessing,in particular we've reconstructed the signal whose spectrum falls within the passband of the filter , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,98,1,0,1099.640,4,4,signalprocessing,now the low pass filter is interpolating in between those samples with a sinusoid that falls within the passband of the low pass filter which no longer matches the frequency of the input sinusoid , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,109,1,0,1202.330,11,11,signalprocessing,and the output of the sampler goes into a low pass filter , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,110,1,0,1206.460,21,21,signalprocessing,so the input from the oscillator goes into the sampler and the output of the sampler goes into the low pass filter , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,112,1,0,1223.600,5,5,signalprocessing,and so the low pass filter has a cutoff frequency as i indicate here of five kilohertz , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,124,1,0,1327.540,18,18,signalprocessing,so to summarize if we sample a signal and then reconstruct from the samples using a low pass filter as long as the sampling frequency is greater than twice the highest frequency in the signal we reconstruct exactly , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,127,1,0,1350.310,20,20,signalprocessing,in other words higher frequencies get folded or reflected down into lower frequencies as they come through the low pass filter , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,147,1,0,1583.460,7,7,signalprocessing,the eye essentially is a low pass filter and so there are things that happen at frequencies above which your eye can track , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,4,0,0,55.220,39,39,signalprocessing,in discussing the sampling theorem we saw that for a band limited signal which is sampled at a frequency that is at least twice the highest frequency we can implement exact reconstruction of the original signal by low pass filtering an impulse train whose areas are identical to the sample values , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,5,0,0,79.640,5,5,signalprocessing,well essentially this low pass filtering operation provides for us an interpolation in between the sampled values , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,88.440,9,9,signalprocessing,in other words the output of a low pass filter in fact is a continuous curve which fits between the sampled values some continuous function , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,0,0,108.810,38,38,signalprocessing,and in fact in today's lecture what i would like to do is first of all developed the interpretation of the reconstruction as an interpolation process and then also see how this exact interpolation using a low pass filter relates to other kinds of interpolation such as linear interpolation that you may already be familiar with , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,12,0,0,158.960,15,15,signalprocessing,and then the reconstruction process corresponds to processing that impulse train with a low pass filter , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,14,0,0,182.020,13,13,signalprocessing,and this replicated spectrum for reconstruction is then processed through a low pass filter , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,15,0,0,190.610,13,13,signalprocessing,and so in fact if this frequency response is an ideal low pass filter as i indicate on the diagram below then multiplying the spectrum of the sample signal by this extracts for us just the portion of the spectrum centered around the origin , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,17,0,0,216.920,14,14,signalprocessing,finally of the reconstructed signal which for the case of an ideal low pass filter is exactly equal to the spectrum of the original signal , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,26,0,0,303.410,13,13,signalprocessing,now in the reconstruction we process that impulse train with a low pass filter , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,28,0,0,313.880,22,22,signalprocessing,and so in the time domain the reconstructed signal is related to the impulse train of samples through a convolution with the filter impulse response , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,34,0,0,400.310,27,27,signalprocessing,and then i've shown here what might be a typical impulse response particularly typical in the case where we're talking about reconstruction with an ideal low pass filter , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,35,0,0,413.280,31,31,signalprocessing,now what happens in the reconstruction is that the convolution of these impulses with this impulse response means that in the reconstruction we superimpose one of these impulse responses whatever the filter impulse response happens to be at each of these time instance , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,38,0,0,443.660,8,8,signalprocessing,of course for the case in which the filter is an ideal low pass filter then what we know is that in that case the impulse response is of the form of a sync function , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,51,0,0,533.930,9,9,signalprocessing,for the particular case of an ideal low pass filter for the reconstruction placed successively at the locations of these impulses , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,55,0,0,558.740,25,25,signalprocessing,so let's take a look at first of all that reconstruction where the impulse response corresponds to the impulse response of an ideal low pass filter , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,56,0,0,569.800,25,25,signalprocessing,shown here first is the continuous time signal which we want to sample and then reconstruct using band limited interpolation or equivalently ideal low pass filtering on the set of samples , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,85,0,0,762.260,14,14,signalprocessing,and let me stress that this reconstruction process by putting the impulses through a filter follows this relationship whether or not this impulse response in fact corresponds to an ideal low pass filter , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,88,0,0,807.120,39,39,signalprocessing,and the ideal reconstruction is often referred to as band limited interpolation because we're interpolating in between the samples by making the assumption that the signal is band limited and using the impulse response for an ideal low pass filter which has a cut off frequency consistent with the assumed bandwidth for the signal , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,101,0,0,956.670,15,15,signalprocessing,in particular the processing of the impulse train of samples by a linear time invariant filter , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,102,0,0,965.520,26,26,signalprocessing,specifically if we consider a system where the impulse response is a rectangular function then in fact if we processed the train of samples through a filter with this impulse response exactly the reconstruction that we would get is what i've shown here , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,106,0,0,1026.540,24,24,signalprocessing,which holds the value or linear interpolation can likewise be interpreted as a process of convulving the impulse train of samples with an appropriate filter impulse response , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,136,0,0,1264.920,32,32,signalprocessing,and notice in this case as in the previous case that what we're basically watching dynamically is the convolution of the impulse train of samples with the impulse response of the interpolating filter which in this particular case is just a rectangular pulse , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,154,0,0,1403.730,22,22,signalprocessing,and what you're watching once again is essentially the convolution process convulving the impulse train with the impulse response of the interpolating filter , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,161,0,0,1467.190,21,21,signalprocessing,well in the frequency domain what we know of course is that for exact interpolation what we want as our interpolating filter is an ideal low pass filter , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,162,0,0,1480.780,12,12,signalprocessing,now keep in mind by the way that an ideal low pass filter is an abstraction as i've stressed several times in the past , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,163,0,0,1487.850,4,4,signalprocessing,an ideal low pass filter is a non causal filter and in fact infinite extent which is one of the reasons why in any case we would use some approximation to it , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,164,0,0,1498.710,9,9,signalprocessing,but here what we have is the exact interpolating filter , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,165,0,0,1505.700,8,8,signalprocessing,and that corresponds to an ideal low pass filter , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,169,0,0,1540.230,9,9,signalprocessing,now notice that it does some approximate low pass filtering , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,170,0,0,1544.930,13,13,signalprocessing,but of course it permits significant energy outside the past band of the filter , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,174,0,0,1587.750,15,15,signalprocessing,and the fact that there's somewhat more attenuation outside the past band of the ideal filter is what suggests in fact that the first order hold or linear interpolation gives us a somewhat smoother approximation to the original signal than the zero order hold does , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,175,0,0,1609.620,17,17,signalprocessing,and so in fact just to compare these two we can see that here is the ideal filter , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,178,0,0,1632.500,22,22,signalprocessing,now in fact in many sampling systems in any sampling system really we need to use some approximation to the low pass filter , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,179,0,0,1643.520,33,33,signalprocessing,and very often in fact what is done in many sampling systems is to first use just the zero order hold and then follow the zero order hold with some additional low pass filtering , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,180,0,0,1657.830,34,34,signalprocessing,well to illustrate some of these ideas and the notion of doing a reconstruction with a zero order hold or first order hold and then in fact adding to that some additional low pass filtering what i'd like to do is demonstrate or illustrate sampling and interpolation in the context of some images , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,191,0,0,1750.490,20,20,signalprocessing,ok now going back to the original sample picture we know that a picture can be reconstructed by low pass filtering from the samples , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,205,0,0,1850.870,29,29,signalprocessing,a very common procedure with computer generated images is to first do a zero order hold as we've done here and then follow that with some additional low pass filtering , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,206,0,0,1862.460,8,8,signalprocessing,and fact we can do that low pass filtering now again by defocusing the camera , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,207,0,0,1867.930,16,16,signalprocessing,and you can begin to see that with the zero order hold plus the low pass filtering the reconstruction is not that bad , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,209,0,0,1883.930,8,8,signalprocessing,and again now the effect of low pass filtering will be somewhat better , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,212,0,0,1899.370,17,17,signalprocessing,with the mosaic in fact with this back in focus you can apply your own low pass filtering to it either by squinting or if you have the right or wrong kind of eyeglasses either taking them off or putting them on , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,222,0,0,1989.970,11,11,signalprocessing,and so the result of the reconstructions with some low pass filtering will be a much more low pass filtered image , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,33,0,0,451.910,27,27,signalprocessing,this is the conversion from continuous time to discreet time what we want to consider now is the overall system which implements not just the conversion but filtering and then coming back out of the conversion back to continuous time , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,36,0,0,493.530,9,9,signalprocessing,that sequence is then processed through our discreet time filter , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,39,0,0,517.980,15,15,signalprocessing,and then finally we carry out the desampling process by simply using a low pass filter with a cutoff associated with the sampling frequency that we used , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,42,0,0,560.160,23,23,signalprocessing,although a fairly typical thing to do in addition to this sampling process is to include what is referred to an anti aliasing filter , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,43,0,0,573.440,6,6,signalprocessing,in other words this is a filter that would band limit the input at at least half the sampling frequency so that we are guaranteed then that there is no aliasing that's carried out in this process , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,48,0,0,628.500,22,22,signalprocessing,and of course what's important about it is that the spectrum we choose is band limited or that there's an anti aliasing filter , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,54,0,0,690.750,7,7,signalprocessing,we now want to carry out some filtering and then after that filtering convert back to a continuous time signal , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,56,0,0,709.040,13,13,signalprocessing,and now the processing that we're carrying out is linear time and variant filtering in the discreet time domain , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,57,0,0,717.380,12,12,signalprocessing,and what that corresponds to then is multiplying this spectrum by the filter frequency response , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,60,0,0,739.790,14,14,signalprocessing,and so now the spectrum of y of n the output of the digital filter is the product of this spectrum and the fourier transform or frequency response of the digital filter , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,61,0,0,756.320,14,14,signalprocessing,now in working our way through we're going to take the output of the filter and undo the two step process , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,62,0,0,763.880,26,26,signalprocessing,so we now want to take that sequence convert it to an impulse train and then take that impulse train and desample through a low pass filter , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,63,0,0,773.460,11,11,signalprocessing,so here we are now at the output of the digital filter , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,67,0,0,792.080,44,44,signalprocessing,in particular we're dividing the frequency axis by capital t whereas this point in y of omega was two pi now it's two pi over capital t what that means is that equivalently we're multiplying this spectrum by the frequency response of the digital filter but now linearly scaled in frequency so that what was a cutoff frequency of omega sub c is now cutoff frequency of omega sub c divided by capital t , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,68,0,0,828.590,13,13,signalprocessing,so now the next step in the process is the reconstructing low pass filter , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,70,0,0,842.020,29,29,signalprocessing,and so finally then the spectrum of the output of the overall system will be the spectrum of the input multiplied by a frequency response which is the digital filter frequency response frequency scaled by dividing that digital filter frequency axis by capital t , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,76,0,0,904.200,18,18,signalprocessing,what we have is an output spectrum which is the product of the input spectrum and the digital filter frequency characteristic frequency scaled , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,77,0,0,916.150,9,9,signalprocessing,and so in fact the resulting continuous time time filter is simply the digital filter with an appropriate frequency scaling , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,78,0,0,929.120,26,26,signalprocessing,in other words with the frequency axis divided by capital t so said another way if we show here the frequency response of the original digital filter then the corresponding continuous time filter would be this frequency scaled , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,79,0,0,959.470,8,8,signalprocessing,and then because of the associated low pass filtering and the reconstruction we would select out just one of these periods in particular the portion around the origin , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,80,0,0,970.070,12,12,signalprocessing,and the essential consequence of that is that the corresponding continuous time filter then is given by this , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,82,0,0,985.840,6,6,signalprocessing,and note that where the digital filter has a cutoff frequency of omega sub c the continuous time filter has a cutoff frequency of omega sub c divided by capital t , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,84,0,0,1001.750,22,22,signalprocessing,and by the way plant away for now and we'll return to this point later the observation that even if the digital filter frequency response is fixed which we would assume it is by changing the sampling frequency in fact what we're able to do is affect a linear scaling all of the equivalent continuous time filter , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,88,0,0,1070.980,13,13,signalprocessing,in the demonstration the specific impulse response that is used for the digital filter or discreet time filter is the one that i show here , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,89,0,0,1086.160,15,15,signalprocessing,and the associated frequency response is the frequency response of a discreet time low pass filter as i indicate below , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,90,0,0,1098.800,6,6,signalprocessing,and the cutoff frequency of that filter , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,91,0,0,1101.520,4,4,signalprocessing,as i indicate the filter was designed as a discreet time filter with a cutoff frequency of pi over five , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,93,0,0,1119.200,9,9,signalprocessing,and so in fact the digital or discreet time filter cutoff frequency is a ten th of two pi , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,97,0,0,1153.040,28,28,signalprocessing,now the equivalent continuous time system in terms of the impulse response is of course a band limited interpolation of the impulse response associated with the discreet time filter , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,101,0,0,1211.000,20,20,signalprocessing,following the discussion that we've previously gone through is a frequency scaled version of the one associated with the digital filter , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,109,0,0,1302.170,9,9,signalprocessing,and so what we'll see after the low pass filter for the impulse response is a smooth curve like this , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,111,0,0,1317.320,13,13,signalprocessing,just to show the zero order hold is to take the low pass filter out temporarily and then put it back in , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,112,0,0,1325.610,7,7,signalprocessing,so first let's just look at the filter impulse response , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,115,0,0,1341.620,8,8,signalprocessing,in other words corresponds to a linear phase filter , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,116,0,0,1345.170,13,13,signalprocessing,we could also look at the impulse response before the desampling low pass filter let's take out the desampling low pass filter slowly and what we observe is basically the output of the digital to analog converter , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,119,0,0,1371.590,5,5,signalprocessing,we can put the desampling filter back in now and notice that the effect of the desampling filter is basically to smooth out the rough edges in the boxcar output from the d to a converter , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,125,0,0,1428.670,5,5,signalprocessing,that goes through the digital filter and gets attenuated or amplified appropriately , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,127,0,0,1448.000,23,23,signalprocessing,theoretically as i indicate here but again as we just saw really represented by a zero order hold followed by a low pass filter , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,129,0,0,1465.310,9,9,signalprocessing,in this particular diagram i've included and anti aliasing filter , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,130,0,0,1472.540,10,10,signalprocessing,in fact in the demonstration there is no anti aliasing filter , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,131,0,0,1477.510,21,21,signalprocessing,and so in fact the input is a sinusoidal input which is not band limited by virtue of an anti aliasing filter , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,133,0,0,1497.530,6,6,signalprocessing,so there is no anti aliasing filter and this is the system , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,142,0,0,1581.870,23,23,signalprocessing,another way of thinking about that is that when we watch the frequency response of the system as we look at the digital filter frequency response what we're sweeping as we go from zero up to ten kilohertz in the input frequency is this portion of the frequency response , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,146,0,0,1636.190,22,22,signalprocessing,and then sweeping from ten kilohertz to twenty kilohertz on the input really because of the aliasing reflects itself in the digital filter by looking back toward lower frequencies , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,147,0,0,1651.590,5,5,signalprocessing,and so the continuous time filter sweeps back down from ten kilohertz back to zero , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,149,0,0,1666.560,10,10,signalprocessing,so now let's look at the frequency response of the filter , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,150,0,0,1671.930,15,15,signalprocessing,now what we'd like to illustrate is the frequency response of the equivalent continuous time filter , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,151,0,0,1678.610,8,8,signalprocessing,and we can do that by sweeping the filter with sinusoidal input , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,153,0,0,1696.420,15,15,signalprocessing,in other words a sweep from zero to effectively pi in terms of the digital filter , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,154,0,0,1703.320,26,26,signalprocessing,so what we'll observe as the input frequency increases is that the output sinusoid will have essentially constant amplitude up to the cutoff frequency of the filter and then approximately zero amplitude past , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,155,0,0,1718.170,5,5,signalprocessing,so let's now sweep the filter frequency response , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,156,0,0,1726.580,4,4,signalprocessing,and there is the filter cutoff frequency , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,157,0,0,1735.300,6,6,signalprocessing,now we can also observe the filter frequency response in several other ways , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,162,0,0,1766.800,27,27,signalprocessing,and in addition to observing the frequency response let's also listen to the output sinusoid and observe the attenuation in the output as we go from the filter passband to the filter stopband , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,164,0,0,1793.290,6,6,signalprocessing,now of course we're in the filter stopband , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,165,0,0,1798.360,33,33,signalprocessing,now if we increase the sweep range from ten kilohertz the twenty kilohertz so that the sweep range is equal to the sampling frequency in essence that corresponds to sweeping out the digital filter from zero to two pi , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,166,0,0,1815.110,15,15,signalprocessing,and in that case we'll begin to see some of the periodicity in the digital filter frequency response , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,169,0,0,1841.140,25,25,signalprocessing,and finally back to a zero to ten kilohertz sweep so that we're again sweeping only from zero to pi with regard to the digital filter , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,170,0,0,1865.070,12,12,signalprocessing,now an important observation is that with the digital or discreet time filter cutoff frequency fixed as i've indicated here and i remind you that what the cutoff frequency is is a ten th of two pi with that cutoff frequency fixed because of the normalization that we get as we come back to a continuous time filter in fact what we have is a cutoff frequency that is dependent on the sampling frequency or on the sampling period , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,172,0,0,1906.580,0,0,signalprocessing,filter or has a cutoff frequency which is a ten th of two pi the normalization as you recall is that two pi in discreet time frequency corresponds to omega sub s the sampling frequency in terms of continuous time frequency , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,174,0,0,1940.180,18,18,signalprocessing,so consequently as we change the sampling frequency what will happen is that even with the discreet time filter cutoff fixed the cutoff frequency of the equivalent continuous time filter will change , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,176,0,0,1960.570,21,21,signalprocessing,but let me again stress and ask you to keep in mind that this demonstration is done without an anti aliasing filter in , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,177,0,0,1969.480,50,50,signalprocessing,and we are going to be changing the sampling frequency and so keep in mind that as we look at this as the input frequency sweeps past half the sampling frequency whatever sampling frequency we happen to be looking at then because of the fact that there's no anti aliasing filter we'll get aliasing , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,178,0,0,1994.360,8,8,signalprocessing,in other words the frequency and the digital filter or discreet time filter as we sweep the input frequency up will move up in frequency until we get past half the sampling frequency and then essentially will move back down in frequency , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,181,0,0,2020.910,10,10,signalprocessing,all right so now let's look at the same digital filter , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,184,0,0,2038.450,6,6,signalprocessing,and we know that the effective filter cutoff frequency is tied to the sampling frequency and for this particular filter corresponds to a ten th of the sampling frequency , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,185,0,0,2052.719,12,12,signalprocessing,consequently if we double the sampling frequency we should double the effective filter passband width or double the filter cutoff frequency , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,188,0,0,2074.690,6,6,signalprocessing,and we should observe that the filter cutoff frequency has now doubled out to four kilohertz , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,189,0,0,2083.469,6,6,signalprocessing,now let's begin to decrease the filter sampling frequency , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,201,0,0,2154.610,14,14,signalprocessing,now let's conclude this demonstration of the effect of the sampling frequency on the filter cutoff frequency by carrying out some filtering on some live audio , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,204,0,0,2186.100,8,8,signalprocessing,and in each of those cases the effective filter cutoff frequency then is cut in half from four kilohertz to two kilohertz to one kilohertz and then to five hundred cycles , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,205,0,0,2197.080,12,12,signalprocessing,so let's begin with a forty kilohertz sampling frequency or an effective filter cutoff frequency of four kilohertz , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,206,0,0,2209.950,13,13,signalprocessing,now let's reduce that a twenty kilohertz sampling frequency or a two kilohertz filter , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,208,0,0,2227.950,15,15,signalprocessing,and finally a five kilohertz sampling frequency corresponding to a five hundred cycle equivalent analog filter , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,211,0,0,2276.160,36,36,signalprocessing,and as you may be aware and as i've tried to indicate previously in the past this in fact is one very important but not the only but one very important context in which discreet time filtering is used , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,217,0,0,2361.170,30,30,signalprocessing,where in fact one step that we might want to take in addition to the steps so we've talked about here is an additional sampling process following whatever kinds of filtering that we do , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,7,0,0,83.000,18,18,signalprocessing,if we've converted from a continuous time signal to a sequence and we then carry out some additional filtering then there's the possibility that we can resample that sequence and as we'll see as we go through the discussion save something in the way of storage or whatever , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,0,0,102.300,21,21,signalprocessing,so discrete time sampling as i indicated has important application in a context referred to here namely resampling after discrete time filtering , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,56,0,0,623.590,21,21,signalprocessing,well the way that we do that just as we did in a continuous time case is by a low pass filtering , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,57,0,0,631.010,18,18,signalprocessing,in particular processing in the time domain or in the frequency domain this with an ideal low pass filter has the effect of extracting that part of the spectrum that in fact we identify with the original signal that we began with , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,59,0,0,658.460,16,16,signalprocessing,as long as there's no aliasing we can recover the original signal by ideal low pass filtering , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,61,0,0,682.960,12,12,signalprocessing,and then that is going to be processed with a low pass filter , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,64,0,0,710.320,6,6,signalprocessing,this is now processed through a filter which for exact reconstruction is an ideal low pass filter , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,73,0,0,767.550,33,33,signalprocessing,consequently the sample sequence is an impulse train whose values are samples of x of at integer multiples of capital n for the reconstruction this is now processed through an ideal low pass filter , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,75,0,0,793.900,14,14,signalprocessing,and so the reconstructed signal is the convolution of the sample sequence and the filter impulse response , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,77,0,0,809.250,22,22,signalprocessing,and so it says then that the reconstruction is carried out by replacing the impulses here these impulses by versions of the filter impulse response , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,78,0,0,827.300,3,3,signalprocessing,well if the filter is an ideal low pass filter then that corresponds in the time domain to sine nx over sine x kind of function , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,144,0,0,1481.810,9,9,signalprocessing,and we then carry out some additional discrete time filtering , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,146,0,0,1492.710,10,10,signalprocessing,and after that conversion we carry out some discrete time filtering , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,152,0,0,1547.220,10,10,signalprocessing,but now if we go through some additional low pass filtering then let's see what happens , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,153,0,0,1553.580,5,5,signalprocessing,if i now low pass filter the sequence x of n then in effect i'm multiplying the sequence spectrum by this filter , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,154,0,0,1566.490,10,10,signalprocessing,and so the result of that the product of the filter frequency response and the fourier transform of x of n would have a shape somewhat like i indicate below , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,155,0,0,1580.130,12,12,signalprocessing,now notice that in this spectrum although in the input to the filter this entire band was filled up in the output of the filter there is a band that in fact has zero energy in it , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,156,0,0,1600.190,13,13,signalprocessing,so what i can consider doing is taking the output sequence from the filter and in fact resampling it in other words sampling it which would be more or less associated with a different sampling rate for the continuous time signals involved , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,160,0,0,1647.400,8,8,signalprocessing,but since i've done some additional low pass filtering as i indicate here there's no problem with aliasing , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,171,0,0,1764.890,25,25,signalprocessing,and that would consist of converting the decimated sequence back to an impulse train and then processing that impulse train by an ideal low pass filter to do the interpolation or reconstruction filling in the values which in this impulse train are equal to zero , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,174,0,0,1798.950,12,12,signalprocessing,and then we desample that by processing it through a low pass filter , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,183,0,0,1879.950,17,17,signalprocessing,and then finally we interpolate between the non zero values here by going through a low pass filter to reconstruct the original sequence , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,195,0,0,1978.610,4,4,signalprocessing,and the low pass filtering would consist of throwing away this replication accounting for a factor which is the factor capital n and extracting the portion of the spectrum which is associated with the spectrum of the original signal which we began with , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,227,0,0,2252.260,22,22,signalprocessing,in the other case what we're going to do is take our sequence put in zeros put it through a low pass filter to interpolate , Lecture1IntroductionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,103,0,0,1084.780,7,7,signalprocessing,and you can see that here by filtering through by eye the rapid variations in the index , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,4,0,0,56.170,8,8,signalprocessing,over the last series of lectures in discussing filtering modulation and sampling we've seen how powerful and useful the fourier transform is , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,109,0,0,1306.690,18,18,signalprocessing,so it would be natural in a setting like that to think of mapping the desired continuous time filter to a discrete time filter , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,114,0,0,1338.440,16,16,signalprocessing,we may or may not be processing a sample continuous time signal with our discrete time filter it may just be discrete time signals that we're working with , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,115,0,0,1348.630,13,13,signalprocessing,but in that situation still we need to design the appropriate discrete time filter , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,127,0,0,1485.450,9,9,signalprocessing,in particular if we are mapping a continuous time filter with let's say a desired or desirable frequency response to a discrete time filter and we would like to preserve the good qualities of that frequency response as we look at the discrete time frequency response then it's important what happens in the s plane for the continuous time filter along the j omega axis relate in a nice way to what happens in the z plane around the unit circle because it's this over here that represents the frequency response in continuous time and this contour over here that represents the frequency response in discrete time , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,130,0,0,1544.370,23,23,signalprocessing,another more or less natural condition to impose is a condition that if we are assured in some way that our continuous time filter is stable then we would like to concentrate on design procedures that more or less preserve that and will give us stable digital filters , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,164,0,0,1918.320,13,13,signalprocessing,what would happen then is that if we saw in the continuous time filter a very sharp resonance the discrete time filter in fact might very well have that resonance broadened considerably because the poles are so far away from the unit circle , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,171,0,0,2037.000,22,22,signalprocessing,it's a very important useful method which kind of can be motivated by thinking along the lines of mapping the continuous time filter to a discrete time filter in such a way that the shape of the impulse response is preserved and in fact more specifically so that the discrete time impulse response corresponds to samples of the continuous time impulse response , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,173,0,0,2075.260,9,9,signalprocessing,so what impulse invariance corresponds to is designing the filter in such a way that the discrete time filter impulse response is simply a sample version of the continuous time filter impulse response with a sampling period which i denote here as capital t that will turn into a slightly confusing parameter shortly and perhaps carried over into the next lecture , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,189,0,0,2266.550,24,24,signalprocessing,let's manipulate this further and eventually what we want to get is a relationship a mapping from the continuous time to the discrete time filter , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,193,0,0,2329.730,6,6,signalprocessing,we now have the discrete time filter in this form , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,194,0,0,2334.200,13,13,signalprocessing,consequently then this procedure of impulse invariance corresponds to mapping the continuous time filter to a discrete time filter by mapping the poles in the continuous time filter , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,195,0,0,2350.080,7,7,signalprocessing,according to this mapping the continuous time filter pole at s sub k gets mapped to a pole e to the s sub k capital t and the coefficients a sub k are preserved , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,201,0,0,2421.190,15,15,signalprocessing,so if this is the continuous time frequency response just simply an ideal low pass filter with a cutoff frequency of omega sub c then the frequency scaling operation would keep the same basic shape but linearly scale the frequency axis so that we now have omega sub c times t then the discrete time frequency response would be a superposition of these added together at multiples of two pi in discrete time frequency , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,204,0,0,2481.210,8,8,signalprocessing,we know that for an ideal low pass filter that looks just fine , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,207,0,0,2506.710,10,10,signalprocessing,so in fact if instead of the ideal low pass filter we had taken a filter that was an approximation to a low pass filter then the corresponding frequency scale version would look as i've shown here , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,214,0,0,2606.540,32,32,signalprocessing,also because of the mapping the fact that poles at s sub k get mapped to poles at e to the s sub k capital t if the analog or continuous time filter is stable meaning that the real part of s sub k is negative then the discrete time filter is guaranteed to be stable , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,220,0,0,2682.850,7,7,signalprocessing,and now to design the discrete time filter using impulse invariance you would carry out a partial fraction expansion of this and that partial fraction expansion is shown below , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,222,0,0,2702.130,6,6,signalprocessing,and to determine the discrete time filter based on impulse invariance we would map the poles and preserve the coefficients a sub k referred to as the residues , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,223,0,0,2714.480,5,5,signalprocessing,and so the discrete time filter that we would end up with as a system function which i indicate here and we have as i said preserved the residue and the pole is now at a to the minus alpha t e to the minus j omega sub r t that's one term and the other term in the sum has a pole at the complex conjugate location , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,232,0,0,2861.790,22,22,signalprocessing,in other words what's happened is that in the process so applying impulse invariance the frequency response of the original continuous time filter is approximately preserved except for some distortion that distortion corresponding to aliasing , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,235,0,0,2895.100,13,13,signalprocessing,if we took the same example and mapped it to a discrete time filter by replacing derivatives by backward differences what happens in that case is that we get a frequency response that i indicate here , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,236,0,0,2912.030,9,9,signalprocessing,notice that the resonance in the original continuous time filter is totally lost , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,240,0,0,2931.810,3,3,signalprocessing,the continuous time filter had a pair of resident poles close to the j omega axis , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,244,0,0,2977.630,22,22,signalprocessing,next time what i would like to do is look at impulse invariance for another example namely the design of a butterworth filter and i'll talk more specifically about what butterworth filters are at the beginning of that lecture , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,0,0,114.390,9,9,signalprocessing,and i'm using capital b to denote a butterworth filter , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,0,0,118.530,13,13,signalprocessing,and by definition the magnitude squared of the frequency response of a butterworth filter is given by this expression , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,14,0,0,164.820,22,22,signalprocessing,at a frequency equal to the parameter omega sub c up here which is referred to as the cutoff frequency the butterworth filter frequency response always goes through the same point namely zero point seven hundred seven , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,15,0,0,180.100,7,7,signalprocessing,and as the order of the butterworth filter capital n , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,19,0,0,216.060,16,16,signalprocessing,and we can infer those from our definition of what the frequency response for the butterworth filter is , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,25,0,0,282.830,22,22,signalprocessing,consequently comparing this expression with this statement leads us to the conclusion that the transfer function b of s of the butterworth filter times b of minus s is given by the expression that i indicate here simply replacing j omega by s , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,27,0,0,310.540,11,11,signalprocessing,that's what we'll want to get as we design a butterworth filter , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,36,0,0,386.020,8,8,signalprocessing,to get the system function for the butterworth filter we'd like to get b of s and the question now is how do we get that , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,43,0,0,456.440,29,29,signalprocessing,so in fact out of each of these pairs we would associate the left half plane pole with b of s and so the transfer function for the butterworth filter for this particular case where the this designates the parameter omega sub c and capital n is three namely a third order butterworth filter is this set of pole locations , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,46,0,0,496.700,16,16,signalprocessing,and now what i'd like to do is talk about the design of a digital butterworth filter using the design technique that we introduced last time namely impulse invariance , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,47,0,0,511.680,31,31,signalprocessing,and the context in which i will phrase the design is the context of mapping a continuous time signal to a discrete time signal carrying out filtering using the discrete time filter that we're designing and then mapping back , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,48,0,0,531.150,8,8,signalprocessing,so we're talking about now a discrete time filter that we want to design through impulse invariance from continuous time butterworth filters and we're going to get our design specifications in the context of having considered discrete time processing of continuous time signals where we will map from a continuous time signal to a sequence carry out the filtering with the discrete time filter that we're going to design , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,50,0,0,579.920,4,4,signalprocessing,but this discrete time filter is the one that we're talking about designing , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,55,0,0,608.470,13,13,signalprocessing,we want to first look at our specifications on the desired continuous time filter and then map those to appropriate specifications on the discrete time filter , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,56,0,0,624.540,12,12,signalprocessing,and what i'll pick for the desired specifications on the continuous time filter is that at one kilohertz i will ask that the continuous time frequency response be down by no more than one db in comparison with its value at omega equals zero , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,58,0,0,660.480,9,9,signalprocessing,and for the stop band i'll specify that the filter is down by fifteen db by the time we've gotten to one point five kilohertz , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,60,0,0,683.850,8,8,signalprocessing,and since we're talking about designing a butterworth filter we know that the butterworth filter is monotonic in the pass band and stop band and so we'll have a filter specification something as i show here , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,64,0,0,713.460,5,5,signalprocessing,essentially we're looking for a filter then that always stays between the specified boundaries here , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,65,0,0,727.580,16,16,signalprocessing,now what we have to figure out is what the corresponding specifications are for the digital filter , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,67,0,0,751.850,7,7,signalprocessing,that imposes specifications on our discrete time filter and then we want to design the discrete time filter using impulse invariance and that's the discrete time filter that we'll use in the overall system , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,68,0,0,767.360,10,10,signalprocessing,all right now we want specifications on the discrete time filter and we want the continuous overall equivalent system to meet certain specifications at certain frequencies related to continuous time frequencies , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,75,0,0,834.620,10,10,signalprocessing,so what this says is that for the discrete time filter we would like the same behavior but at frequencies or the same specifications but at frequencies normalized to the discrete time frequency axis , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,78,0,0,885.680,9,9,signalprocessing,and we now want to design the discrete time filter using impulse invariance , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,79,0,0,894.260,51,51,signalprocessing,now in impulse invariance as you recall it corresponds to generating an impulse response which is a sampled version of the continuous time impulse response and there is a temptation naturally to think all of this parameter capital t as necessarily identical to the sampling in the system in which the filter is going to be used , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,83,0,0,968.850,32,32,signalprocessing,all right but let's now look then at where we are in our design procedure and specifically what it is that we need to do in order to design the digital butterworth filter , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,84,0,0,986.000,22,22,signalprocessing,now we have a set of specifications that we've generated relating essentially to how we want the pass band of the digital filter and the stop band of the digital filter to behave , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,85,0,0,1001.050,7,7,signalprocessing,of course since this isn't an ideal filter it has some transition from pass band to stop band and as we discussed last time there is aliasing which we need to at least be aware of , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,87,0,0,1041.040,53,53,signalprocessing,and in particular now if we were to simply pick that parameter in the impulse invariant design capital t as equal to unity and i indicated just a minute ago that we can pick it arbitrarily if i pick it as unity then the procedure would consist of designing the continuous time butterworth filter with meeting or exceeding the appropriate specifications and then going through the impulse invariant procedure , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,92,0,0,1119.550,12,12,signalprocessing,and so what we need to do then is design a butterworth filter , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,93,0,0,1124.000,14,14,signalprocessing,i'm using capital b here again to denote the frequency response of the butterworth filter , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,94,0,0,1129.400,2,2,signalprocessing,the butterworth filter to have a magnitude which is greater than or equal to minus one db prior to the frequency zero point two pi and less than or equal to minus fifteen at a frequency beyond zero point three pi , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,97,0,0,1190.320,10,10,signalprocessing,and this obviously isn't satisfactory as parameters for the butterworth filter , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,101,0,0,1222.510,9,9,signalprocessing,and that means that we'll end up with a filter that does even better than the specifications , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,110,0,0,1324.720,10,10,signalprocessing,now what that gives us is a butterworth continuous time filter which we are then mapping through impulse invariance with capital t equal to one to a discrete time filter , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,111,0,0,1342.960,3,3,signalprocessing,that discrete time filter to be used in a system which has an associated sampling frequency which is ten kilohertz , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,112,0,0,1354.620,6,6,signalprocessing,so to get the discrete time filter then we first determine b of s as we just did or at least i indicated how to do it , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,115,0,0,1392.860,13,13,signalprocessing,and this then will give us the transfer function for the discrete time filter , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,118,0,0,1422.580,8,8,signalprocessing,and as we had originally specified the digital filter is supposed to be greater than or equal to minus one db at point two pi and less than or equal to minus fifteen db at zero point three pi , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,120,0,0,1454.090,29,29,signalprocessing,now this is an illustration of the impulse invariant procedure and it has a number of very nice properties one of which is that it takes a continuous time filter frequency response and it converts it to a discrete time frequency response which in the absence of aliasing looks identical except for a linear frequency scale change , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,123,0,0,1489.950,8,8,signalprocessing,and for some problems for example if the filter that we're trying to design is not band limited or low pass then the aliasing will naturally become intolerable , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,126,0,0,1524.430,36,36,signalprocessing,the bilinear transformation which i won't try to derive here in any detail is a mapping of continuous time filters to discrete time filters corresponding to taking the laplace transform variable s in the continuous time filter and replacing it by what is referred to as a bilinear function of z , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,130,0,0,1573.570,37,37,signalprocessing,and let me just say quickly and in passing that although we won't go through this the notion that the bilinear transformation can be tied to the concept of taking the differential equation for the continuous time filter converting it to an integral equation by integrating enough times on both sides and then converting that to a difference equation by approximating the integrals with the trapezoidal rule , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,131,0,0,1610.200,11,11,signalprocessing,and that in effect will correspond to mapping the continuous time filter to a discrete time filter with the bilinear transformation , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,146,0,0,1822.544,23,23,signalprocessing,all right now that means that there is a nonlinear distortion of the frequency axis if we were to take a continuous time filter and convert it to a discrete time filter with the bilinear transformation , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,149,0,0,1854.300,9,9,signalprocessing,suppose that i want to design a discrete time filter and what is going to happen is that it will be mapped to a continuous time filter or the relationship between the two frequency axes will be given by this curve , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,151,0,0,1887.900,12,12,signalprocessing,if this were mapped through the bilinear transformation to a discrete time filter then this cutoff frequency would fall over here which is related through this curve and this cutoff frequency the stop band edge would be here , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,153,0,0,1916.930,15,15,signalprocessing,so let's suppose now that what i'd like to do is design a discrete time filter where the discrete time filter has certain frequency specifications which is what our previous example has , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,155,0,0,1943.070,20,20,signalprocessing,the design procedure would then correspond to mapping those frequencies to the corresponding continuous time frequencies designing the continuous time filter to meet the specifications based on those critical frequencies then taking the continuous time design and mapping it back to a discrete time filter through the bilinear transformation , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,156,0,0,1977.101,13,13,signalprocessing,all right now what we want to do is again map a butterworth filter continuous time butterworth filter to a digital filter in such a way that the digital filter approximately meets the specifications that we had before , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,160,0,0,2021.800,9,9,signalprocessing,so we want to design the same discrete time filter as we did before with impulse invariance , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,167,0,0,2075.070,13,13,signalprocessing,and that means then that the corresponding critical frequencies of the continuous time filter are at twice the tangent of zero point two pi over two and twice the tangent of zero point three pi over two , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,168,0,0,2094.920,11,11,signalprocessing,so that means then that the specifications on our continuous time filter are given by this essentially pass band and stop band edges warped through that nonlinear curve this nonlinear curve , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,169,0,0,2112.620,16,16,signalprocessing,and i'm using capital g here to denote the system function for the resulting continuous time filter , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,170,0,0,2124.350,10,10,signalprocessing,and so now we could think of designing a butterworth filter that let's say exactly meets these specifications , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,172,0,0,2149.770,20,20,signalprocessing,and again we have the issue that if we want to meet or exceed the specifications we can't make the filter order lower we have to make it higher , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,173,0,0,2160.440,15,15,signalprocessing,and so we would make it instead of five point three we would make the filter order equal to six , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,178,0,0,2206.910,10,10,signalprocessing,and the result of doing that is to choose a filter order capital n equal to six and the parameter omega sub c in the butterworth filter is given by zero point seventy six thousand six hundred twenty two , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,179,0,0,2224.350,13,13,signalprocessing,all right so now we have the parameters for the continuous time butterworth filter which when mapped to the discrete time filter through the bilinear transformation will exceed our requirements in the pass band and just meet the stop band cutoff , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,181,0,0,2252.950,7,7,signalprocessing,and given the parameters of the butterworth filter we can draw our appropriate circle in the s plane which happens to be the same circle as before but with a different radius , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,185,0,0,2296.810,18,18,signalprocessing,and once we have the transfer function b of s we then map that to a discrete time filter by mapping through the bilinear transformation , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,188,0,0,2324.260,23,23,signalprocessing,here i show again on both a linear magnitude scale and on a logarithmic or db scale the frequency response of the resulting filter , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,197,0,0,2403.870,11,11,signalprocessing,and notice in fact something very interesting which is that the filter that we obtained by mapping the butterworth filter to a digital filter through the bilinear transformation in fact falls off in frequency much more rapidly than the one that we got through impulse invariance , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,205,0,0,2492.920,28,28,signalprocessing,so in fact what we're looking at as we look out along this frequency axis is we're seeing higher and higher and higher frequencies in the continuous time filter , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,206,0,0,2508.520,16,16,signalprocessing,by the time we get to pi we should in fact be in the continuous time filter equivalently off to infinity which sounds like a pretty uncomfortable place to be , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,211,0,0,2580.830,18,18,signalprocessing,and i stress again that you may want to do that mapping whether or not the discrete time filter is eventually going to be used for processing continuous time signals , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,212,0,0,2595.970,39,39,signalprocessing,now impulse invariance had the very nice characteristic that it corresponds to a linear mapping between the two frequency axes except for the issue of aliasing and that's a problem with it and in particular limits its usefulness to filter designs or for mapping continuous time filters that are band limited , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,213,0,0,2626.610,33,33,signalprocessing,on the other hand we have the bilinear transformation as a design procedure which totally avoids aliasing but has the disadvantage or difficulty that it represents a nonlinear mapping from the continuous time filter to the discrete time filter , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,215,0,0,2656.400,21,21,signalprocessing,it's not acceptable if for example we had a linear frequency characteristic that we wanted to map to a discrete time filter and end up with a linear frequency characteristic , Lecture25FeedbackMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,65.970,3,3,signalprocessing,for example for filtering for modulation et cetera , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,119,0,0,1393.780,23,23,signalprocessing,and in fact the convolution property as i'm about to introduce it forms the mathematical and conceptual basis for the whole notion of filtering which in fact will be a topic by itself in a set of lectures and in fact is a chapter by itself in the textbook , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,142,0,0,1713.930,14,14,signalprocessing,as i indicated the convolution property forms the basis for what's referred to as filtering , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,145,0,0,1744.560,3,3,signalprocessing,essentially conceptually what filtering as it's typically referred to corresponds to is modifying separately the individual frequency components in a signal , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,147,0,0,1779.570,21,21,signalprocessing,for example what i've illustrated here is the frequency response of what is commonly referred to as an ideal low pass filter , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,148,0,0,1790.220,5,5,signalprocessing,what an ideal low pass filter does is to pass exactly frequencies in one frequency range and eliminate totally frequencies outside that range , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,149,0,0,1804.350,1,1,signalprocessing,another filter which is not so ideal might for example , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,151,0,0,1819.650,19,19,signalprocessing,in terms of filtering we can think back to the differentiation property and in fact interpret differentiator as a filter , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,166,0,0,1957.810,8,8,signalprocessing,and so for example we could low pass filter this picture simply by asking the video crew if they could be slightly defocus it , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,169,0,0,1985.020,9,9,signalprocessing,and now let's take out the defocusing low pass filter and go back to a focused image , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,175,0,0,2027.490,10,10,signalprocessing,or if we interpret differentiation in the context of our filter then what we're saying is that in effect what's happening is that the differentiator is accentuating the high frequencies because of the frequency shape of the differentiator , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,179,0,0,2072.610,6,6,signalprocessing,and so either viewed as a filter or viewed intuitively , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,184,0,0,2127.270,12,12,signalprocessing,i've emphasized that we'll be returning to a much broader discussion of filtering at a later point in the course , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,192,0,0,2209.040,10,10,signalprocessing,the convolution property is the basis as i indicated for filtering , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,236,0,0,2636.240,13,13,signalprocessing,and given just the little bit of discussion that we had previously about filtering you should be able to infer something about the filtering characteristics of this simple first order differential equation , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,238,0,0,2668.160,29,29,signalprocessing,so in fact you could think of the defocusing that we did on the image of fourier you could think of that approximately as similar to the kind of filtering action that you would get by passing a signal through a first order differential equation , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,264,0,0,2909.190,12,12,signalprocessing,we've seen already a glimpse of how it plays a role in filtering modulation how its properties help us with linear constant coefficient differential equations et cetera , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,267,0,0,2940.190,32,32,signalprocessing,and then after we have the continuous time and discrete time fourier transforms we'll then see how the concepts involved and the properties involved lead to very important and powerful notions of filtering modulation sampling and other signal processing ideas ]

Concept = C211
Keyword = [Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,68,0,0,746.550,3,4,signalprocessing,now formally the convolution property can be developed by taking the convolution sum applying the fourier transform sum to it doing the appropriate substitution of variables interchanging order of summations et cetera and all the algebra works out to show that it's a product , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,25,0,0,291.370,10,11,signalprocessing,and we can justify that simply by substitution into the convolution integral , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,17,0,0,202.630,10,11,signalprocessing,so we can see that by substituting that into the convolution sum and recognizing again very strongly paralleling the continuous time argument that we can rewrite this factor as z to the n z to the minus k , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,27,0,0,322.520,25,29,signalprocessing,so let's begin with a discussion of discrete time signals and in particular the issue of how discrete time signals can be decomposed as a linear combination of delayed impulses , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,47,0,0,603.600,7,8,signalprocessing,and this is referred to as the convolution sum , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,100,0,0,1212.380,35,36,signalprocessing,so for a linear time invariant system quite amazingly actually if you know its response to an impulse at t zero or n zero depending on discrete or continuous time then in fact through the convolution sum in discrete time or the convolution integral in continuous time you can generate the response to an arbitrary input , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,102,0,0,1241.560,5,6,signalprocessing,again reminding you of the convolution sum in the discrete time case which looks as i've indicated here the sum of x k h n k will have the requirement of making such frequent reference to convolution that it's convenient to notationally represent it as i have here with an asterisk , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,104,0,0,1277.060,31,35,signalprocessing,and correspondingly in the continuous time case we have the convolution integral which here is the sifting integral as we talked about representing x t in terms of itself as a linear combination of delayed impulses , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,105,0,0,1294.800,4,5,signalprocessing,here we have the convolution integral and again we'll use the asterisk to denote convolution , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,107,0,0,1307.750,2,4,signalprocessing,there are properties of convolution which tell us about properties of linear time invariant systems , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,110,0,0,1345.960,7,8,signalprocessing,so returning to the expression for the convolution sum as i show here the sum of x k h n k let's focus in on an example where we choose x n as a unit step and h n as a real exponential times the a unit step , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,197,0,0,2236.960,3,4,signalprocessing,in general the convolution sum is as i've indicated here , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,198,0,0,2243.490,10,11,signalprocessing,this is just our expression from before which is the convolution sum , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,252,0,0,2815.010,4,5,signalprocessing,again we have the convolution integral which is the integral indicated at the top , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,275,0,0,3098.950,11,13,signalprocessing,in the next lecture what we'll turn to are some general properties of convolution and show how this rather amazing representation of linear time invariant systems in fact leads to a variety of properties of linear time invariant systems , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,0,0,0,42.500,14,15,signalprocessing,last time we talked about the representation of linear time invariant systems through the convolution sum in the discrete time case and the convolution integral in the continuous time case , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,9,0,0,141.240,18,19,signalprocessing,let me begin by reminding you of the basic result that we developed last time which is the convolution sum in discrete time as i indicate here and the convolution integral in continuous time , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,10,0,0,160.820,3,4,signalprocessing,and what the convolution sum or the convolution integral , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,15,0,0,231.000,3,5,signalprocessing,one of the properties of convolution is that it is what is referred to as commutative , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,109,0,0,1059.860,8,9,signalprocessing,and we have here as a reminder the convolution integral which tells us how x tau and h t tau are combined to give us y t , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,202,0,0,1943.860,17,18,signalprocessing,while i won't work through it in detail it essentially boils down to recognizing that in the convolution sum or in the convolution integral if in fact that condition is satisfied on the impulse response then the upper limit on the sum in the discrete time case changes to n , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,15,0,0,199.100,13,14,signalprocessing,the output into the corresponding linear combination of these then led to the convolution sum in the discrete time case , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,16,0,0,208.430,30,31,signalprocessing,and in the continuous time case a similar kind of decomposition in terms of impulses and associated representation of the output in terms of the impulse response led to the convolution integral , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,37,0,0,496.020,24,25,signalprocessing,now more or less the justification for this or the proof follows by simply looking at the response to a complex exponential using the convolution integral , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,125,0,0,1493.190,10,11,signalprocessing,you can demonstrate this property algebraically by essentially taking the convolution integral and applying the fourier transform and doing the appropriate interchanging of the order of integration et cetera , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,141,0,0,1688.630,25,26,signalprocessing,i understand that going through that involves a little bit of sorting out and i strongly encourage you to try to understand and interpret the convolution property in those conceptual terms rather than simply by applying the mathematics to the convolution integral and seeing the terms match up on both sides , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,241,0,0,2714.950,13,14,signalprocessing,we've just gotten the impulse response and we could put that through the convolution integral to get the response to this input ]

Concept = ZT31
Keyword = [Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,295,0,0,2916.510,17,18,signalprocessing,beginning in the next lecture what i will introduce is the laplace transform and beyond that the z transform , Lecture1IntroductionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,150,0,0,1597.630,41,42,signalprocessing,and in the context of the frequency domain representation some of the kinds of ideas and topics that we'll be exploring are the fourier transform and the laplace transform and a discrete time counterpart of the laplace transform which is the z transform , Lecture1IntroductionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,152,0,0,1623.990,5,6,signalprocessing,and the laplace transform and z transform represent extensions of the fourier transform and we'll be getting into that later in the course , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,90.300,30,31,signalprocessing,the generalization that we'll be talking about in the continuous time case is referred to as the laplace transform and in the discrete time case is referred to as the z transform , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,0,0,111.010,11,12,signalprocessing,continue that into the next lecture and following that develop the z transform for discrete time , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,251,0,0,2534.440,21,22,signalprocessing,in the next lecture what i'd like to do is parallel the discussion for discrete time turn our attention to the z transform and as you can imagine simply by virtue of the fact that i have shown you a digital and analog version of very much the same kind of system the discussions parallel themselves very strongly and the z transform will play very much the same role in discrete time that the laplace transform does in continuous time , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,5,0,0,72.750,28,29,signalprocessing,so what we want to talk about is generalizing the fourier transform and what this will lead to in discrete time is a notion referred to as the z transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,25,0,0,311.150,10,11,signalprocessing,and it is this summation which is defined as the z transform of the sequence h of n , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,29,0,0,356.990,30,31,signalprocessing,now we have a mapping here from the impulse response to the amplitude or the eigenvalue associated with that input and this mapping is what is referred to as the z transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,30,0,0,376.130,3,4,signalprocessing,so h of z is in fact the z transform of the impulse response , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,31,0,0,383.060,43,44,signalprocessing,and if we consider applying this mapping as we did in continuous time in a similar argument applying this mapping to a sequence whether or not it corresponds to the impulse response or a linear time invariant system that leads then to the z transform of a general sequence x of n , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,32,0,0,406.270,1,2,signalprocessing,the z transform being defined by this relationship , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,33,0,0,411.410,11,12,signalprocessing,and again notationally we'll often represent a time function and a z transform through a shorthand notation just indicating that x of z is the z transform of x of n , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,36,0,0,453.750,5,6,signalprocessing,and that corresponds to the z transform here it corresponded to the laplace transform in the continuous time case , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,38,0,0,471.200,10,11,signalprocessing,and once again what you would expect is that the z transform has a very close and important relationship to the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,42,0,0,498.650,20,21,signalprocessing,first of all what we recognize is that if we compare the fourier transform expression for a sequence and the z transform expression for the same sequence that they involve essentially the same operations , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,44,0,0,536.900,4,5,signalprocessing,said another way the z transform when z is e to the j omega is going to reduce to the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,46,0,0,556.710,15,16,signalprocessing,namely that for a certain set of values of the complex variable the transform the z transform reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,47,0,0,568.470,6,7,signalprocessing,so if we have x of z the z transform and we look at that for z equal to e to the j omega and z equal to e to the j omega is similar to saying that we're looking at that for the magnitude of z equal to one , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,50,0,0,597.290,2,3,signalprocessing,so the z transform for z equal to e to the j omega is the fourier transform and so this then corresponds to x of omega , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,59,0,0,662.620,21,22,signalprocessing,and now what we can see is that given the fact that we want to generalize the fourier transform to the z transform it's convenient now to use as notation for the fourier transform x of z with z equal to e to the j omega , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,67,0,0,758.100,11,12,signalprocessing,so we have one relationship between the fourier transform and the z transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,68,0,0,763.060,8,9,signalprocessing,namely the fact that for the magnitude of z equal to one the z transform reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,72,0,0,801.210,9,10,signalprocessing,well we have a very similar situation with the z transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,73,0,0,805.430,9,10,signalprocessing,in particular in addition to the fact that the z transform for z equal to e to the j omega reduces to the fourier transform we'll see that the z transform for other values of z is the fourier transform of the sequence with an exponential weighting , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,75,0,0,830.180,8,9,signalprocessing,here we have the general expression for the z transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,79,0,0,875.530,7,8,signalprocessing,well what this says is that the z transform which is this at z equal to r e to the j omega is in fact the fourier transform of what , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,92,0,0,982.060,9,10,signalprocessing,well let's just look at some examples of the z transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,104,0,0,1060.310,5,6,signalprocessing,now let's look at the z transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,105,0,0,1062.740,1,2,signalprocessing,the z transform is the sum from minus infinity to plus infinity of a to the n z to the minus n times the unit step , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,112,0,0,1115.710,2,3,signalprocessing,now the z transform is the fourier transform of the sequence a to the n times r to the minus n , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,113,0,0,1128.090,5,6,signalprocessing,and this statement about the z transform converging is exactly identical to the statement that what we're requiring is that the magnitude of a times r to the minus one be less than one where this represents the exponential factor that we have that in effect is applied to the sequence so that the fourier transform becomes the z transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,115,0,0,1176.920,13,14,signalprocessing,so from what we've worked out here then what we have is the z transform of a to the n times u of n is one over one minus a z to the minus one , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,120,0,0,1220.040,4,5,signalprocessing,so associated with the z transform of this sequence is this algebraic expression and this set of values on z for which that algebraic expression is valid , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,121,0,0,1232.820,21,22,signalprocessing,and just as with the laplace transform this range of values is referred to as the region of convergence of the z transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,122,0,0,1247.530,21,22,signalprocessing,now again as we saw with the laplace transform it's important to recognize that in specifying or having worked out the z transform of a sequence it's not just the algebraic expression but also the region of convergence that's required to uniquely specify it , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,124,0,0,1277.500,14,15,signalprocessing,and if you work that one through what you find is that algebraically the z transform of this sequence is one over one minus a z to the minus one , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,129,0,0,1326.230,13,14,signalprocessing,and also as with the laplace transform it's convenient in looking at the z transform to represent it in the complex plane , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,130,0,0,1342.330,10,11,signalprocessing,in this case the complex plane referred to as the z plane whereas in continuous time when we talked about the laplace transform it was the s plane z of course because z is the complex variable in terms of which we're representing the z transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,131,0,0,1357.910,6,7,signalprocessing,so we will be representing the z transform in terms of representations in the complex plane real part and imaginary part , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,134,0,0,1379.750,18,19,signalprocessing,recall that in the discussion that we just came from when we talked about the relationship between the z transform and the fourier transform the z transform reduces to the fourier transform when the magnitude of z is equal to one , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,137,0,0,1408.880,8,9,signalprocessing,and so it's on this contour in the z plane that the z transform reduces to the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,140,0,0,1438.440,10,11,signalprocessing,here it's the behavior on the unit circle where the z transform corresponds to the fourier transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,145,0,0,1487.920,5,6,signalprocessing,and with this sequence the z transform is one divided by one minus a z to the minus one , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,152,0,0,1554.160,17,18,signalprocessing,let me just indicate that as you'll see as you work examples it's very typical for the z transform to come out as a function of z to the minus one , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,171,0,0,1731.510,11,12,signalprocessing,for example if we were looking at the magnitude of the z transform the magnitude of the z transform would be the ratio of the length of this vector to the length of this vector , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,174,0,0,1766.910,13,14,signalprocessing,well let's focus on that also in the context of a slightly different z transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,175,0,0,1777.855,2,3,signalprocessing,in the z transform here as we'll see in a later lecture , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,176,0,0,1783.260,2,3,signalprocessing,is the z transform associated with a second order difference equation , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,186,0,0,1865.940,23,24,signalprocessing,so in fact if we looked at the fourier transform associated with this pole zero pattern if this was for example represented the z transform of the impulse response or a linear time invariant system the corresponding frequency response would be what i plotted out below , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,237,0,0,2356.990,13,14,signalprocessing,now just as with the laplace transform the region of convergence of the z transform as we've seen in this example is a very important part of the specification of the z transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,242,0,0,2427.940,22,23,signalprocessing,for example we recognize that the region of convergence does not contain any poles because of the fact that at poles the z transform in fact blows up and of course can't converge at that point , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,245,0,0,2461.720,2,3,signalprocessing,with the z transform the region of convergence consists of a ring basically because of the fact that the region of convergence is dependent on the magnitude of z , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,277,0,0,2787.570,24,25,signalprocessing,what i'd like to do is just conclude with a discussion of how we get the time function back again when we have the z transform including its region of convergence , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,281,0,0,2819.350,16,17,signalprocessing,but basically what we can use to develop a formal expression is the fact that the z transform is the fourier transform of the sequence exponentially weighted , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,284,0,0,2846.020,30,31,signalprocessing,after we've taken care of a few of the epsilons and deltas we'll end up with an expression that expresses formally the sequence x of n in terms of the z transform where this in fact is a contour integral in the complex plane , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,287,0,0,2887.350,5,6,signalprocessing,so if we had a z transform as i indicate here and if we expand it out in a partial fraction expansion then we can recognize as we did in a similar style with the laplace transform we can recognize that each term together with the identified region of convergence corresponds to an exponential factor , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,293,0,0,2971.370,10,11,signalprocessing,but it's kind of the idea of developing the inverse z transform by recognizing that this z transform formula in fact is a power series , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,298,0,0,3017.650,8,9,signalprocessing,particularly if we want to get the inverse z transform for a z transform expression which is not rational , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,303,0,0,3058.580,18,19,signalprocessing,what we'll see when we continue this in the next lecture is that there are properties of the z transform just as there were properties of the laplace transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,304,0,0,3070.630,10,11,signalprocessing,and those properties allow us to develop and exploit the z transform in the context of systems describable by linear constant coefficient difference equations , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,305,0,0,3084.250,12,13,signalprocessing,so in the next lecture we'll focus on some properties of the z transform and then we'll see how to use those properties to help us in getting further insight and working with systems describable by difference equations , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,4,0,0,55.444,8,9,signalprocessing,last time we began the discussion of the z transform , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,6,0,0,69.000,7,8,signalprocessing,the expression that we got for the z transform is the sum that i indicate here , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,7,0,0,77.050,7,8,signalprocessing,we also briefly talked about an inverse z transform integral and some other informal methods of computing the inverse z transform , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,8,0,0,87.660,10,11,signalprocessing,but we focused in particular on the relationship between the z transform and the fourier transform pointing out first of all that the z transform when we choose the magnitude of z equal to one so the magnitude of z of the form e to the j omega just simply reduces to the fourier transform of the sequence , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,9,0,0,115.210,6,7,signalprocessing,then in addition we explored the z transform for z a more general complex number , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,10,0,0,122.640,4,5,signalprocessing,in the discrete time z transform case we expressed that complex number in polar form as r e to the j omega and recognize that the z transform expression in fact corresponds to the fourier transform of the sequence exponentially weighted , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,11,0,0,145.400,6,7,signalprocessing,because of the exponential weighting the z transform converges for some values of r corresponding to some exponential waiting and perhaps not for others and that led to a notion which corresponded to the region of convergence associated with the z transform , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,13,0,0,177.900,2,3,signalprocessing,now they z transform has a number of important and useful properties just as the laplace transform does , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,16,0,0,207.570,16,17,signalprocessing,in particular there is as with continuous time a linearity property that tells us that the z transform of a linear combination of sequences is the same linear combination of the z transforms a shifting property that indicates that the z transform of x of n shifted is the z transform of x of n multiplied by a factor z to the minus n zero , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,17,0,0,239.780,7,8,signalprocessing,then the convolution property for which the z transform of a convolution of sequences is the product of the associated z transforms , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,22,0,0,302.770,8,9,signalprocessing,because of the convolution property associated with the z transform the z transform of the output is the z transform of the input times the z transform of the impulse response , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,24,0,0,329.410,8,9,signalprocessing,in fact because of the relationship between the z transform and the fourier transform the z transform of the impulse response evaluated on the unit circle in other words for the magnitude of z equal to one in fact corresponds to the frequency response of the system , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,25,0,0,350.060,7,8,signalprocessing,more generally when we talk about the z transform of the impulse response we will refer to it as the system function associated with the system , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,28,0,0,403.510,8,9,signalprocessing,i'm sorry the region of convergence of a z transform , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,29,0,0,407.080,14,15,signalprocessing,and the issue of where that is in relation to the poles of the z transform , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,37,0,0,487.870,4,5,signalprocessing,that means that the z transform converges on the unit circle , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,38,0,0,493.640,11,12,signalprocessing,consequently if the system is stable then the system function the z transform or the impulse response must also converge on the unit circle , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,43,0,0,545.980,12,13,signalprocessing,for a sequence that's right sided the region of convergence of its z transform must be outside the outermost pole , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,53,0,0,676.540,13,14,signalprocessing,now what i'd like to do is look at the properties of the z transform and in particular exploit these properties in the context of systems that are described by linear constant coefficient difference equations , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,59,0,0,737.900,12,13,signalprocessing,we can use the linearity property so that if we take the z transform of both sides of this expression that will then be the z transform of this term plus the z transform of this term , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,60,0,0,754.180,17,18,signalprocessing,so using those properties and together with the shifting property the property that tells us that the z transform of y of n minus one is z to the minus one times the z transform of y of n we then convert the difference equation to an algebraic expression , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,61,0,0,775.400,9,10,signalprocessing,and we can solve this algebraic expression for the z transform of the output in terms of the z transform of the input , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,62,0,0,786.100,14,15,signalprocessing,now what we know from the convolution property is that for a system the z transform of the output is the system function times the z transform of the input , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,63,0,0,798.440,16,17,signalprocessing,so this factor that we have then must correspond to the system function or equivalently the z transform of the impulse response of the system , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,64,0,0,812.360,7,8,signalprocessing,in fact then if we have this z transform we could figure out what the impulse response of the system is by computing or determining what the inverse z transform except for the fact that expression is an algebraic expression and doesn't yet totally specify the z transform because we don't yet know what the region of convergence is , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,75,0,0,957.320,18,19,signalprocessing,in any case given this region of convergence then the impulse response is the inverse transform of that z transform which is a to the n times u of n , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,78,0,0,989.880,5,6,signalprocessing,again i can apply the z transform to this expression and i've skipped an algebraic step or two here , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,101,0,0,1189.020,7,8,signalprocessing,this is now a look at the z transform and we see very strong parallels to the laplace transform , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,104,0,0,1227.460,53,54,signalprocessing,what i'd like to do now is turn our attention to another very important reason for mapping from continuous time to discrete time and in the process of doing this what we'll need to do is exploit fairly heavily the insight intuition and procedures that we've developed for the laplace transform and the z transform , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,140,0,0,1656.560,14,15,signalprocessing,now what we can use are the properties of the laplace transform and the z transform to see what this means in terms of a mapping in particular using the differentiation property for laplace transforms , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,142,0,0,1676.970,5,6,signalprocessing,using the properties for the z transform the z transform of this expression would be this , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,191,0,0,2299.100,4,5,signalprocessing,we can compute the z transform of this and the z transform that we get i show here it's simply a sub k over one minus e to the s sub k capital t z to the minus one simply carrying this term or this parameter down , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,272,0,0,2775.560,33,34,signalprocessing,and beginning with the next set of lectures we'll be talking about the fourier transform and much later in the course what's referred to as the laplace transform for continuous time and the z transform for discrete time , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,273,0,0,2790.070,16,17,signalprocessing,and what we'll see is that with the fourier transform and later with the laplace and z transform we'll have a number of efficient and very useful ways of generating the solution for differential and difference equations under the assumption that the system is causal linear and time invariant ]

Keyword = [Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,68,0,0,746.550,3,4,signalprocessing,now formally the convolution property can be developed by taking the convolution sum applying the fourier transform sum to it doing the appropriate substitution of variables interchanging order of summations et cetera and all the algebra works out to show that it's a product , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,25,0,0,291.370,10,11,signalprocessing,and we can justify that simply by substitution into the convolution integral , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,17,0,0,202.630,10,11,signalprocessing,so we can see that by substituting that into the convolution sum and recognizing again very strongly paralleling the continuous time argument that we can rewrite this factor as z to the n z to the minus k , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,27,0,0,322.520,25,29,signalprocessing,so let's begin with a discussion of discrete time signals and in particular the issue of how discrete time signals can be decomposed as a linear combination of delayed impulses , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,47,0,0,603.600,7,8,signalprocessing,and this is referred to as the convolution sum , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,100,0,0,1212.380,35,36,signalprocessing,so for a linear time invariant system quite amazingly actually if you know its response to an impulse at t zero or n zero depending on discrete or continuous time then in fact through the convolution sum in discrete time or the convolution integral in continuous time you can generate the response to an arbitrary input , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,102,0,0,1241.560,5,6,signalprocessing,again reminding you of the convolution sum in the discrete time case which looks as i've indicated here the sum of x k h n k will have the requirement of making such frequent reference to convolution that it's convenient to notationally represent it as i have here with an asterisk , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,104,0,0,1277.060,31,35,signalprocessing,and correspondingly in the continuous time case we have the convolution integral which here is the sifting integral as we talked about representing x t in terms of itself as a linear combination of delayed impulses , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,105,0,0,1294.800,4,5,signalprocessing,here we have the convolution integral and again we'll use the asterisk to denote convolution , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,107,0,0,1307.750,2,4,signalprocessing,there are properties of convolution which tell us about properties of linear time invariant systems , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,110,0,0,1345.960,7,8,signalprocessing,so returning to the expression for the convolution sum as i show here the sum of x k h n k let's focus in on an example where we choose x n as a unit step and h n as a real exponential times the a unit step , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,197,0,0,2236.960,3,4,signalprocessing,in general the convolution sum is as i've indicated here , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,198,0,0,2243.490,10,11,signalprocessing,this is just our expression from before which is the convolution sum , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,252,0,0,2815.010,4,5,signalprocessing,again we have the convolution integral which is the integral indicated at the top , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,275,0,0,3098.950,11,13,signalprocessing,in the next lecture what we'll turn to are some general properties of convolution and show how this rather amazing representation of linear time invariant systems in fact leads to a variety of properties of linear time invariant systems , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,0,0,0,42.500,14,15,signalprocessing,last time we talked about the representation of linear time invariant systems through the convolution sum in the discrete time case and the convolution integral in the continuous time case , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,9,0,0,141.240,18,19,signalprocessing,let me begin by reminding you of the basic result that we developed last time which is the convolution sum in discrete time as i indicate here and the convolution integral in continuous time , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,10,0,0,160.820,3,4,signalprocessing,and what the convolution sum or the convolution integral , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,15,0,0,231.000,3,5,signalprocessing,one of the properties of convolution is that it is what is referred to as commutative , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,109,0,0,1059.860,8,9,signalprocessing,and we have here as a reminder the convolution integral which tells us how x tau and h t tau are combined to give us y t , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,202,0,0,1943.860,17,18,signalprocessing,while i won't work through it in detail it essentially boils down to recognizing that in the convolution sum or in the convolution integral if in fact that condition is satisfied on the impulse response then the upper limit on the sum in the discrete time case changes to n , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,15,0,0,199.100,13,14,signalprocessing,the output into the corresponding linear combination of these then led to the convolution sum in the discrete time case , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,16,0,0,208.430,30,31,signalprocessing,and in the continuous time case a similar kind of decomposition in terms of impulses and associated representation of the output in terms of the impulse response led to the convolution integral , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,37,0,0,496.020,24,25,signalprocessing,now more or less the justification for this or the proof follows by simply looking at the response to a complex exponential using the convolution integral , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,125,0,0,1493.190,10,11,signalprocessing,you can demonstrate this property algebraically by essentially taking the convolution integral and applying the fourier transform and doing the appropriate interchanging of the order of integration et cetera , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,141,0,0,1688.630,25,26,signalprocessing,i understand that going through that involves a little bit of sorting out and i strongly encourage you to try to understand and interpret the convolution property in those conceptual terms rather than simply by applying the mathematics to the convolution integral and seeing the terms match up on both sides , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,241,0,0,2714.950,13,14,signalprocessing,we've just gotten the impulse response and we could put that through the convolution integral to get the response to this input ]

Concept = S0
Keyword = [Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,227,0,0,2222.830,4,5,signalprocessing,because we have a unit step here which shuts this off for n less than zero we can change the limits on the sum , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,7,0,0,106.110,3,4,signalprocessing,for example a sinusoidal signal has three parameters amplitude frequency and phase , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,0,0,114.520,18,19,signalprocessing,and we could think for example of using one signal to vary let's say the amplitude of a sinusoidal signal , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,0,0,124.730,17,18,signalprocessing,and what that leads to is a notion which we'll develop in some detail referred to as sinusoidal amplitude modulation and would correspond to a sinusoidal signal referred to as the carrier and it's amplitude being varied on the basis of another signal , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,147.700,15,16,signalprocessing,now alternatively we could think of varying either the frequency or the phase of a sinusoidal signal again with another signal , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,20,0,0,237.480,47,48,signalprocessing,now also a notion that that leads to and we'll be developing in some detail is the idea that you can simultaneously transmit more than one signal by in essence taking several voice signals or other signals using them to modulate either the frequency or amplitude of sinusoidal signals at different frequencies adding all those together that's a process called multiplexing and then at the other end of the transmission system taking those sinusoidal signals apart , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,151,0,0,1412.410,12,13,signalprocessing,so we are talking about a carrier signal which is simply a sinusoidal signal with some phase , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,152,0,0,1422.920,13,14,signalprocessing,and of course we can write that as the sum of two complex exponential signals , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,267,0,0,2430.660,24,25,signalprocessing,well to indicate where the tradeoff comes from or where the issue surfaces notice that what we're doing is tracking the envelope of the sinusoidal signal , Lecture14DemonstrationofAmplitudeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,262,0,0,1586.130,12,13,signalprocessing,another thing we can do is to vary the frequency of the sinusoidal signal that's modulating it , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,92,0,0,1287.650,15,16,signalprocessing,and the carrier signal in this particular case is a pulse train rather than a sinusoidal signal , Lecture15DiscreteTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,95,0,0,1312.490,10,11,signalprocessing,and previously we've talked about a carrier signal which is sinusoidal signal , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,41,1,0,552.290,32,33,signalprocessing,and in order to both understand that term better and to understand in fact the effect better it's useful to examine this a little more closely for the specific example of a sinusoidal signal , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,43,1,0,569.500,18,19,signalprocessing,and what we want to look at is the effect of aliasing when our input signal is a sinusoidal signal , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,47,1,0,600.530,10,11,signalprocessing,well what we have is an input signal is a sinusoidal signal , Lecture16SamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,106,1,0,1184.490,8,9,signalprocessing,so we've seen the effect of aliasing for sinusoidal signals in terms of waveforms , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,319,0,0,2971.870,23,24,signalprocessing,and the inverse transform of this is now again referring to the same example minus e to the minus two t times the unit step , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,332,0,0,3090.970,64,65,signalprocessing,and so in fact the answer that we will get when we decompose this use the partial fraction expansion being very careful about associating the region of convergence of this pole to the right and of this pole to the left we'll have then when we're all done a time function which will be of the form e to the minus t times the unit step for t positive , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,95,0,0,1004.280,18,19,signalprocessing,let's consider first of all an exponential sequence x of n equals a to the n times the unit step , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,105,0,0,1062.740,24,25,signalprocessing,the z transform is the sum from minus infinity to plus infinity of a to the n z to the minus n times the unit step , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,106,0,0,1076.480,1,2,signalprocessing,the unit step will change the lower limit to zero , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,188,0,0,2255.440,17,18,signalprocessing,we're sampling at t equals n capital t and so we've replaced that here and then the unit step to truncate things for negative time , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,5,0,0,81.020,8,9,signalprocessing,let's begin with one signal the continuous time sinusoidal signal which perhaps you're already somewhat familiar with , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,89.650,4,5,signalprocessing,mathematically the continuous time sinusoidal signal is expressed as i've indicated here , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,0,0,114.950,5,6,signalprocessing,and graphically the continuous time sinusoidal signal has the form shown here , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,124.440,2,3,signalprocessing,now the sinusoidal signal has a number of important properties that we'll find it convenient to exploit as the course goes along one of which is the fact that the sinusoidal signal is what is referred to as periodic , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,13,0,0,171.420,15,16,signalprocessing,and we can demonstrate it mathematically by simply substituting into the mathematical expression for the sinusoidal signal t t zero in place of t , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,21,0,0,248.750,5,6,signalprocessing,and going back to our sinusoidal signal we can see that and i've indicated here then the period as two pi omega zero , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,23,0,0,270.160,8,9,signalprocessing,now in addition a useful property of the sinusoidal signal is the fact that a time shift of a sinusoid is equivalent to a phase change , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,24,0,0,284.290,13,14,signalprocessing,and we can demonstrate that again mathematically in particular if we put the sinusoidal signal under a time shift , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,29,0,0,362.970,10,11,signalprocessing,and so for example if we look at the general sinusoidal signal that we saw previously in effect changing the phase corresponds to moving this signal in time one way or the other , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,30,0,0,382.990,7,8,signalprocessing,for example if we look at the sinusoidal signal with a phase equal to zero that corresponds to locating the time origin at this peak , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,48,0,0,534.600,21,22,signalprocessing,so illustrated below is the graph now when we have a phase of pi two in our cosine which is a sinusoidal signal , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,55,0,0,598.390,14,15,signalprocessing,and we'll find many occasions not only to refer to signals more general than sinusoidal signals as even in some cases and odd in other cases , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,66,0,0,670.530,3,4,signalprocessing,a discrete time sinusoidal signal mathematically is as i've indicated here a cos omega zero n phi , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,68,0,0,699.820,7,8,signalprocessing,and i've illustrated here several discrete time sinusoidal signals , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,84,0,0,831.390,8,9,signalprocessing,and for example if we take a particular sinusoidal signal , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,127,0,0,1191.480,16,17,signalprocessing,to explore that a little more carefully let's look at the expression again for a general sinusoidal signal with an arbitrary amplitude frequency and phase , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,139,0,0,1299.850,7,8,signalprocessing,for example let's look at some particular sinusoidal signals , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,147,0,0,1349.890,7,8,signalprocessing,so what that says is that this sinusoidal signal is periodic , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,161,0,0,1438.350,13,14,signalprocessing,so in fact what that says is that if you look at this sinusoidal signal it's not periodic at all even though you might fool yourself into thinking it is simply because the envelope looks periodic , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,164,0,0,1467.180,10,11,signalprocessing,well we've seen then some important distinctions between continuous time sinusoidal signals and discrete time sinusoidal signals , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,168,0,0,1504.850,15,16,signalprocessing,in particular for the continuous time case if we have a general expression for the sinusoidal signal that i've indicated here that's periodic for any choice of omega zero , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,173,0,0,1597.890,6,7,signalprocessing,in particular if i consider these sinusoidal continuous time signals as i vary omega zero what will happen is that i will always see different sinusoidal signals , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,178,0,0,1629.670,14,15,signalprocessing,and the statement that i'm making is that if i have two discrete time sinusoidal signals at two different frequencies and if these frequencies are separated by an integer multiple of two pi namely if omega two is equal to omega one point two pi times an integer m when i substitute this into this expression because of the fact that n is also an integer i'll have m n as an integer multiple of two pi , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,180,0,0,1676.350,29,30,signalprocessing,on the other hand in the continuous time case since t is not restricted to be an integer variable for different values of omega one and omega two these sinusoidal signals will always be different , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,182,0,0,1697.650,13,14,signalprocessing,now many of the issues that i've raised so far in relation to sinusoidal signals are elaborated on in more detail in the text , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,184,0,0,1716.150,4,5,signalprocessing,let me stress that sinusoidal signals will play an extremely important role for us as building blocks for general signals and descriptions of systems and leads to the whole concept fourier analysis which is very heavily exploited throughout the course , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,187,0,0,1746.820,4,5,signalprocessing,these relate strongly to sinusoidal signals namely the class of real and complex exponentials , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,244,0,0,2202.580,7,8,signalprocessing,and what this corresponds to are two sinusoidal signals ninety degrees out of phase as indicated by the fact that there's a cosine and a sine , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,248,0,0,2239.070,8,9,signalprocessing,what i've indicated at the top is a sinusoidal signal with a time varying exponential envelope or an envelope which is a real exponential and in particular which is growing namely with r greater than zero , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,250,0,0,2266.240,4,5,signalprocessing,and this kind of sinusoidal signal by the way is typically referred to as a damped sinusoid , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,292,0,0,2623.230,5,6,signalprocessing,and those together with the sinusoidal signals and exponentials as we've talked about today will really form the cornerstone for essentially all of the signal and system analysis that we'll be dealing with for the remainder of course , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,3,0,0,59.745,11,12,signalprocessing,in the last lecture we discussed sinusoidal and real and complex exponential signals both for continuous time and discrete time , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,5,0,0,82.540,13,14,signalprocessing,in today's lecture i'd like to introduce some additional basic signals specifically the unit step and unit impulse signal , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,91.830,9,10,signalprocessing,let's begin with discrete time and the discrete time unit step and unit impulse , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,7,0,0,98.820,3,4,signalprocessing,the discrete time unit step is a sequence as i've indicated here specifically a sequence which is zero for negative values of its argument and equal to one for positive values of its argument and zero , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,0,0,118.970,3,4,signalprocessing,so mathematically the unit step sequence is one for n greater than or equal to zero and zero for n less than zero , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,0,0,133.660,1,2,signalprocessing,the unit impulse sequence likewise is defined in a straightforward way , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,139.430,1,2,signalprocessing,the unit impulse sequence is a sequence which is zero for all values of its argument except for n zero , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,151.210,2,3,signalprocessing,so the unit step and unit impulse sequence are defined in a straightforward way mathematically , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,13,0,0,165.170,2,3,signalprocessing,specifically the unit impulse can be related to the unit step through the relationship that i've indicated here delta of n the unit impulse equal to a unit step minus the unit step delayed , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,15,0,0,194.180,14,15,signalprocessing,and to see the validity of this expression we can simply look at the unit step and its delayed version , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,16,0,0,204.380,5,6,signalprocessing,so here we show the unit step u n , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,17,0,0,209.400,4,5,signalprocessing,here we show the unit step delayed by one , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,19,0,0,217.890,11,12,signalprocessing,and clearly if we subtract the delayed step from the original unit step everything subtracts out except at n zero at which point the difference is equal to one , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,20,0,0,232.070,14,15,signalprocessing,and so the difference between u n and u n one is simply the unit impulse sometimes incidentally also referred to as the unit sample , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,21,0,0,246.490,9,10,signalprocessing,now in a similar way we can express the unit step in terms of the unit impulse , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,25,0,0,268.260,17,18,signalprocessing,if we think of forming the sum from minus infinity up to some value n of a unit impulse or unit sample then this running sum in fact is equal to the unit step , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,30,0,0,326.900,11,12,signalprocessing,so we have then one expression for the relationship between the unit step and the unit sample , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,31,0,0,334.700,16,17,signalprocessing,we can also develop another relationship by observing in essence that if we look at the unit step sequence as i've returned to here we can in effect think of the unit step sequence as a succession of unit impulses one following another , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,33,0,0,390.160,16,17,signalprocessing,and when we continue to add these up then what they add up to is the unit step sequence , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,36,0,0,420.270,10,11,signalprocessing,we will find it equally useful to talk about a unit step continuous time signal and a unit impulse continuous time signal , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,37,0,0,430.550,6,7,signalprocessing,let's begin with the continuous time unit step , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,38,0,0,436.670,3,4,signalprocessing,the continuous time unit step function is graphically indicated as i've shown here , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,44,0,0,488.460,5,6,signalprocessing,and one can define the unit step at t zero in a variety of ways but the essential point is that the unit step function is discontinuous , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,45,0,0,501.220,12,13,signalprocessing,so in effect what we need to do is think of the unit step function as the limit of a continuous function , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,48,0,0,535.450,9,10,signalprocessing,and so we can think then of the discontinuous unit step as the limiting form of u delta t as delta goes to zero , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,49,0,0,548.350,7,8,signalprocessing,now we also want to define a unit impulse function , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,52,0,0,562.130,21,22,signalprocessing,and to motivate the definition let me return to the discrete time definition or rather the discrete time relationship between the unit step and the unit impulse function , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,53,0,0,577.010,7,8,signalprocessing,in discrete time we saw that the unit impulse function is the first difference of the unit step function , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,54,0,0,590.790,19,20,signalprocessing,well similarly in continuous time we can talk about an impulse function which is the first derivative of a unit step function , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,55,0,0,605.030,2,3,signalprocessing,so the unit impulse as we want to define it is the derivative of the unit step , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,56,0,0,611.850,10,11,signalprocessing,of course we just finished discussing the fact that the unit step function is in fact discontinuous at t zero , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,57,0,0,621.710,14,15,signalprocessing,but we can think of its derivative as related to this approximation to the unit step , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,59,0,0,642.540,4,5,signalprocessing,so to define the unit impulse we think of the derivative of this approximation to the unit step and then observe what happens as delta goes to zero , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,60,0,0,655.440,7,8,signalprocessing,we have then the definition of the unit impulse function more or less formally defined as the first derivative of the unit step or thought of as the limiting form of the derivative of the approximation to the unit step in the limit as delta the duration of the discontinuity goes to zero , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,70,0,0,783.380,11,12,signalprocessing,and in this case since we took the derivative of a unit step the height is equal to one , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,72,0,0,799.360,15,16,signalprocessing,it's mathematically not terribly comfortable because what we've done is taken the derivative of the unit step which has a discontinuity at the origin and there's some mathematical difficulties in doing that , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,74,0,0,825.460,15,16,signalprocessing,i remember something that sam mason used to say that his students said about the unit impulse , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,75,0,0,832.990,4,5,signalprocessing,his definition was the unit impulse is something that's so small every place i can't see it except at one point where it's so big i can't see it , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,77,0,0,844.090,6,7,signalprocessing,well accept some informality with the unit impulse function in the continuous time case and generally we'll see that we won't get into particular difficulty , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,82,0,0,885.370,8,9,signalprocessing,in fact mathematically the relationship is that the unit step function in continuous time is the running integral of the unit impulse function , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,30,0,0,352.640,13,14,signalprocessing,and more or less as we did when we talked about representing a unit step in terms of impulses we can think of this general sequence as a sequence of impulses delayed namely occurring at the appropriate time instant and with the appropriate amplitude , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,45,0,0,567.140,24,25,signalprocessing,and it's generally useful to rather than carrying around h zero n just simply define h zero n as h n which is the unit sample or unit impulse response of the system , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,52,0,0,642.810,22,23,signalprocessing,if this impulse for example generates a response which is x zero h n where h n is the response to a unit impulse at n zero and the second one generates a delayed weighted response and the third one similarly and we generate these individual responses these are all added together and it's that linear combination that forms the final output , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,110,0,0,1345.960,34,35,signalprocessing,so returning to the expression for the convolution sum as i show here the sum of x k h n k let's focus in on an example where we choose x n as a unit step and h n as a real exponential times the a unit step , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,157,0,0,1810.930,11,12,signalprocessing,so here is our example with x t equal to a unit step and h t now a real exponential times a unit step , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,158,0,0,1822.280,8,9,signalprocessing,i show here x t which is the unit step function , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,200,0,0,2253.080,8,9,signalprocessing,the example of an input which is a unit step and an impulse response which is a real exponential multiplied by a unit step we have then replacing x k by what we know the input to be and h n k by what we know the impulse response to be the output is the expression that we have here , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,204,0,0,2311.100,30,31,signalprocessing,in particular let's look at the sum and what we observe first of all is that the limits on this sum are going to be modified depending on where this unit step is zero and non zero , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,205,0,0,2330.390,26,27,signalprocessing,in particular if we first consider what will turn out to be the simple case namely n less than zero for n less than zero this unit step is zero for k greater than n , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,206,0,0,2350.640,9,10,signalprocessing,with n less than zero that means that this unit step never is non zero for k positive , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,207,0,0,2361.480,5,6,signalprocessing,on the other hand this unit step is never non zero or always zero for k negative , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,208,0,0,2371.350,14,15,signalprocessing,let me just stress that by looking at the particular graphs here is the unit step u k , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,209,0,0,2380.840,3,4,signalprocessing,here is the unit step u n k and for n less than zero so that this point comes before this point the product of these two is equal to zero , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,214,0,0,2430.470,17,18,signalprocessing,if we just look back at the summation that we had the summation now corresponds to this unit step and this unit step having some overlap , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,215,0,0,2448.260,15,16,signalprocessing,so for interval two corresponding to n greater than zero we have u k the unit step , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,216,0,0,2460.150,8,9,signalprocessing,we have u n k which is a unit step going backward in time but which extends for positive values of n , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,218,0,0,2484.320,11,12,signalprocessing,well for k starting at zero corresponding to one of the unit steps and ending at n corresponding to the other unit step , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,253,0,0,2825.070,10,11,signalprocessing,our example you recall was with x t as a unit step and h t as an exponential times a unit step , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,258,0,0,2880.300,6,7,signalprocessing,for t less than zero this unit step which only begins at tau zero and this unit step which is zero by the time tau gets up to t and beyond , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,259,0,0,2896.170,10,11,signalprocessing,for t less than zero there's no overlap between the unit step going forward in time and the unit step going backward in time , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,262,0,0,2928.070,14,15,signalprocessing,in that case what happens again is that the overlap in essence of the unit step tells us gives us a range on the integration in particular the two steps overlap when t is greater than zero from tau zero to tau t , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,264,0,0,2959.370,4,5,signalprocessing,this product of this unit step and this unit step is equal to one in this range and so that allows us then to change the limits on the integral instead of from infinity to infinity we know that the integrand is non zero only over this range , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,20,0,0,278.930,31,32,signalprocessing,and in fact in the lecture last time we worked an example where we had in discrete time an impulse response which was an exponential and an input which is a unit step , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,28,0,0,338.740,15,16,signalprocessing,in other words the text works the example where the system impulse response is a unit step , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,338,0,0,3083.460,11,12,signalprocessing,of course the impulse response of a single integrator is a unit step , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,339,0,0,3087.580,8,9,signalprocessing,two integrators together is the integral of a unit step et cetera , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,342,0,0,3116.000,16,17,signalprocessing,and for example with a single integrator u sub minus one of t corresponds to our unit step as we talked about previously u sub minus two of t corresponds to a unit ramp et cetera , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,66,0,0,743.150,10,11,signalprocessing,let's consider for example an input which is a scaled unit step , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,68,0,0,759.805,19,20,signalprocessing,a solution with a step input is what i've indicated here a scalar one minus an exponential times a unit step , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,84,0,0,929.310,16,17,signalprocessing,here again is the step response as we just worked it out this time for a unit step , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,194,0,0,2230.080,33,34,signalprocessing,and what the modulation property as we'll see when we explore it in more detail tells us is that if we have a signal with a certain spectrum and we multiply by a sinusoidal signal whose fourier transform is a set of impulses then in a frequency domain we convolve , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,195,0,0,2251.500,24,25,signalprocessing,and that corresponds to taking the original spectrum and translating it shifting it in frequency up to the frequency of the carrier namely the sinusoidal signal , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,230,0,0,2593.130,9,10,signalprocessing,well it's e to the minus at times a unit step , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,259,0,0,2835.440,35,36,signalprocessing,we now have the sum of two terms and if we now recognize by inspection the inverse fourier transform of this we see that it's simply minus e to the minus two t times the unit step , Lecture9FourierTransformPropertiesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,260,0,0,2853.720,11,12,signalprocessing,this one is plus e to the minus t times the unit step ]

Concept = S1
Keyword = [Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,0,0,86.330,10,11,signalprocessing,so in the case of linear time invariant systems the basic idea was to consider decomposing the input as a linear combination of basic inputs , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,119.610,25,26,signalprocessing,so basically what we attempted to do was decompose the input and then reconstruct the output through a linear combination of the outputs to those basic inputs , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,11,0,0,133.620,9,10,signalprocessing,we then focused on the notion of choosing the basic inputs with two criteria in mind , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,12,0,0,140.890,18,19,signalprocessing,one was to choose them so that a broad class of signals could be constructed out of those basic inputs , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,13,0,0,150.020,7,8,signalprocessing,and the second was to choose the basic inputs so that the response to those was easy to compute , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,15,0,0,169.500,20,21,signalprocessing,and then in beginning the discussion of the fourier representation of continuous time signals we chose as another set of basic inputs complex exponentials , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,16,0,0,181.880,9,10,signalprocessing,so for continuous time we chose a set of basic inputs which were complex exponentials , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,20,0,0,228.930,34,35,signalprocessing,and also by the way as it developed later that frequency response as you should now recognize from this expression is in fact the fourier transform the continuous time fourier transform of the system impulse response , Lecture10DiscreteTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,33,0,0,398.340,24,25,signalprocessing,this particular expression in fact will correspond to what we'll refer to as the fourier transform the discrete time fourier transform of the system impulse response , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,59,0,0,639.610,9,10,signalprocessing,in particular if we have a system with an impulse response h of n input x of n the output is the convolution , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,60,0,0,647.710,23,24,signalprocessing,the convolution property then tells us that in the frequency domain the fourier transform is the product of the fourier transform of the impulse response and the fourier transform of the input , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,61,0,0,665.120,15,16,signalprocessing,now we also saw and have talked about a relationship between the fourier transform the impulse response and what we call the frequency response in the context of the response of a system to a complex exponential , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,64,0,0,705.920,25,26,signalprocessing,and as you saw in the video course manual this eigenvalue this constant multiplier on the exponential is in fact the fourier transform of the impulse response evaluated at that frequency , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,67,0,0,733.280,9,10,signalprocessing,the frequency response interpretation of the fourier transform the impulse response we use that to motivate an intuitive interpretation of the convolution property , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,74,0,0,805.990,41,42,signalprocessing,if we think of pushing through the system that linear combination then each of those complex exponentials gets the amplitude modified or multiplied by the fourier transform of by the frequency response which we saw is the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,121,0,0,1288.860,24,25,signalprocessing,and from the convolution property then that complex function must in fact correspond to the frequency response or equivalently the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,122,0,0,1305.620,13,14,signalprocessing,so if we want to determine the fourier transform of the or the impulse response of the system let's say for example then it becomes a matter of having identified the fourier transform of the impulse response which is the frequency response , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,123,0,0,1323.500,9,10,signalprocessing,we now want to inverse transform to get the impulse response , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,128,0,0,1363.960,25,26,signalprocessing,and so in essence by inspection very similar to what has gone on in continuous time essentially by inspection we can then solve for the impulse response to the system , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,132,0,0,1396.380,4,5,signalprocessing,here we have the impulse response for that associated with the system described by that particular difference equation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,135,0,0,1434.520,5,6,signalprocessing,now if instead actually the impulse response was such that we picked a to be negative between minus one and zero then the impulse response in the time domain looks like this , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,149,0,0,1596.720,8,9,signalprocessing,above the dow jones average we show the impulse response of the difference equation , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,151,0,0,1606.080,2,3,signalprocessing,and the impulse response will be displayed on an expanded scale in relation to the scale of the input and for that matter the scale of the output , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,152,0,0,1620.300,3,4,signalprocessing,now with the impulse response shown here which is just an impulse in fact the output shown on the bottom trace is exactly identical to the input , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,153,0,0,1631.880,15,16,signalprocessing,and what we'll want to do now is increase first the parameter a and the impulse response will begin to look like an exponential with a duration that's longer and longer as a moves from zero to one , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,161,0,0,1705.930,7,8,signalprocessing,and when a finally reaches zero the impulse response of the filter will again be an impulse and so the output will be once again identical to the input , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,167,0,0,1758.740,37,38,signalprocessing,we see that the high frequencies or rapid variations are emphasized and finally let's move from minus one back towards zero taking out the highpass filtering and ending up with a equal to zero corresponding to an impulse response which is an impulse in other words an identity system , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,168,0,0,1784.010,15,16,signalprocessing,and let me stress once again that the time scale on which we displayed the impulse response is an expanded time scale in relation to the time scale on which we displayed the input and the output , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,228,0,0,2417.640,8,9,signalprocessing,so it says in fact that multiplying that impulse response or if we think of a positive and a negative that is algebraically similar to multiplying the impulse response by minus one to the n , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,231,0,0,2443.060,26,27,signalprocessing,now it's interesting that what that says is that if we have a system which corresponds to a lowpass filter as i indicate here with an impulse response h of n , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,233,0,0,2469.860,20,21,signalprocessing,if we want to convert that to a highpass filter we can do that by generating a new system whose impulse response is minus one to the n times the impulse response of the lowpass filter , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,236,0,0,2524.650,33,34,signalprocessing,since this ideal highpass filter is this ideal lowpass filter with the frequency response shifted by pi the modulation property tells us that in the time domain what that corresponds to is an impulse response multiplied by minus one to the n , Lecture11DiscreteTimeFourierTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,237,0,0,2546.950,5,6,signalprocessing,so it says that the impulse response of the highpass filter or equivalently the inverse fourier transform of the highpass filter frequency response is minus one to the n times the impulse response for the lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,9,0,0,119.190,35,36,signalprocessing,now what this means in terms of linear time invariant filters since we know that in the time domain the output of a linear time invariant filter is the convolution of the input and the impulse response it says essentially then in the frequency domain that the fourier transform of the output is the product the fourier transform of the impulse response namely the frequency response and the fourier transform of the input , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,33,0,0,345.290,6,7,signalprocessing,and shown below it is the impulse response , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,34,0,0,349.580,10,11,signalprocessing,so here is the frequency response and below it the impulse response of the ideal lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,35,0,0,359.020,12,13,signalprocessing,and this of course is a sine x over x form of impulse response , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,36,0,0,364.270,14,15,signalprocessing,and recognize also or recall that since this frequency response is real valued the impulse response in other words the inverse transform is an even function of time , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,37,0,0,379.150,13,14,signalprocessing,and notice also since i want to refer back to this that the impulse response of an ideal lowpass filter in fact is non causal , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,40,0,0,401.680,2,3,signalprocessing,so the impulse response of the ideal lowpass filter is symmetric and continues to have tails off to plus and minus infinity , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,42,0,0,419.610,8,9,signalprocessing,let's look at the frequency response and associated impulse response for an ideal discrete time lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,44,0,0,436.230,6,7,signalprocessing,and below what i show the impulse response , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,45,0,0,440.000,9,10,signalprocessing,again it's a sine x over x type of impulse response , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,47,0,0,454.760,18,19,signalprocessing,that means as a consequence of the properties of the fourier transform and inverse fourier transform that the impulse response is an even function in the time domain , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,58,0,0,569.900,4,5,signalprocessing,and we saw the impulse response , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,59,0,0,574.190,1,2,signalprocessing,the impulse response is what we had shown here , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,71,0,0,659.180,6,7,signalprocessing,the problem is that since the impulse response is even and in fact has tails that go off to plus and minus infinity it's non causal , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,204,0,0,1821.410,13,14,signalprocessing,and in fact it's easy to verify that this indeed corresponds to the impulse response of the filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,207,0,0,1841.410,8,9,signalprocessing,a five point moving average would have an impulse response that just consists of a rectangle of length five , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,212,0,0,1878.860,6,7,signalprocessing,and so this again is the impulse response and frequency response of a nonideal lowpass filter , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,229,0,0,2047.380,6,7,signalprocessing,at the top we see the impulse response for the moving average , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,238,0,0,2103.340,9,10,signalprocessing,again i emphasize that the time scale for the impulse response is significantly expanded in relationship to the time scale for both the input and the output , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,253,0,0,2257.540,27,28,signalprocessing,and so interpreting the first order difference equation as a system what we're attempting to generate is the frequency response which is the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,257,0,0,2307.440,16,17,signalprocessing,and of course the inverse fourier transform of that which i indicate below is the system impulse response , Lecture12FilteringMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,258,0,0,2317.910,17,18,signalprocessing,so we have the frequency response obtained by applying the fourier transform to the difference equation the impulse response , Lecture13ContinuousTimeModulationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,132,0,0,1220.620,9,10,signalprocessing,equivalently this filter doesn't correspond to a filter whose impulse response is real , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,28,0,0,313.880,13,14,signalprocessing,and so in the time domain the reconstructed signal is related to the impulse train of samples through a convolution with the filter impulse response , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,29,0,0,328.280,23,24,signalprocessing,and carrying out this convolution since this is just a train of pulses in effect what happens in this convolution is that this impulse response gets reproduced at each of the locations of the impulses in x of p of t with the appropriate area , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,30,0,0,348.790,20,21,signalprocessing,and finally then in the time domain the reconstructed signal is simply a linear combination of shifted versions of the impulse response with amplitudes which are the sample values , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,34,0,0,400.310,10,11,signalprocessing,and then i've shown here what might be a typical impulse response particularly typical in the case where we're talking about reconstruction with an ideal low pass filter , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,35,0,0,413.280,15,16,signalprocessing,now what happens in the reconstruction is that the convolution of these impulses with this impulse response means that in the reconstruction we superimpose one of these impulse responses whatever the filter impulse response happens to be at each of these time instance , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,38,0,0,443.660,25,26,signalprocessing,of course for the case in which the filter is an ideal low pass filter then what we know is that in that case the impulse response is of the form of a sync function , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,40,0,0,463.070,6,7,signalprocessing,and so in fact the interpolating impulse response may have and will have as this discussion goes along some different shapes , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,42,0,0,476.750,17,18,signalprocessing,this process of effectively doing the interpolation by replacing each of the impulses by an appropriate interpolating impulse response and adding these up , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,48,0,0,513.500,13,14,signalprocessing,and the reconstruction will be carried out by showing the location of the impulse response as it moves along in the wave form , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,49,0,0,522.950,13,14,signalprocessing,and then the reconstructed curve is simply the summation of those as that impulse response moves along , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,50,0,0,529.350,7,8,signalprocessing,so what you'll see then is an impulse response like this , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,55,0,0,558.740,13,14,signalprocessing,so let's take a look at first of all that reconstruction where the impulse response corresponds to the impulse response of an ideal low pass filter , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,85,0,0,762.260,22,23,signalprocessing,and let me stress that this reconstruction process by putting the impulses through a filter follows this relationship whether or not this impulse response in fact corresponds to an ideal low pass filter , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,86,0,0,783.700,18,19,signalprocessing,what this expression always says is that reconstructing this way corresponds to replacing the impulses by a shifted impulse response with an amplitude that is an amplitude corresponding to the sample value , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,88,0,0,807.120,32,33,signalprocessing,and the ideal reconstruction is often referred to as band limited interpolation because we're interpolating in between the samples by making the assumption that the signal is band limited and using the impulse response for an ideal low pass filter which has a cut off frequency consistent with the assumed bandwidth for the signal , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,102,0,0,965.520,8,9,signalprocessing,specifically if we consider a system where the impulse response is a rectangular function then in fact if we processed the train of samples through a filter with this impulse response exactly the reconstruction that we would get is what i've shown here , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,103,0,0,992.450,5,6,signalprocessing,alternatively if we chose an impulse response which was a triangular impulse response then what in effect happens is that each of these impulses activates this triangle , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,106,0,0,1026.540,17,18,signalprocessing,which holds the value or linear interpolation can likewise be interpreted as a process of convulving the impulse train of samples with an appropriate filter impulse response , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,108,0,0,1055.260,14,15,signalprocessing,first of all where we have a zero order hold as corresponding to this impulse response , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,112,0,0,1086.130,22,23,signalprocessing,and following that we'll do exactly the same thing with the same wave form using a first order hold or a triangular impulse response , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,115,0,0,1118.820,9,10,signalprocessing,below it the set of samples together with the impulse response moving along , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,136,0,0,1264.920,21,22,signalprocessing,and notice in this case as in the previous case that what we're basically watching dynamically is the convolution of the impulse train of samples with the impulse response of the interpolating filter which in this particular case is just a rectangular pulse , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,139,0,0,1304.800,11,12,signalprocessing,so in this case we want to interpolate using a triangular impulse response rather then the sine x over x or rectangular impulse responses that we showed previously , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,154,0,0,1403.730,13,14,signalprocessing,and what you're watching once again is essentially the convolution process convulving the impulse train with the impulse response of the interpolating filter , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,157,0,0,1442.210,9,10,signalprocessing,one being interpolation in the time domain with an impulse response which is a rectangle , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,158,0,0,1448.130,10,11,signalprocessing,the second being interpolation in the time domain with an impulse response which is a triangle , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,166,0,0,1511.030,19,20,signalprocessing,if instead we carried out the interpolating using the zero order hold the zero order hold has a rectangular impulse response , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,171,0,0,1553.670,18,19,signalprocessing,well instead of the zero order hold if we used the first order hold corresponding to the triangular impulse response in that case then in the frequency domain the associated frequency response would be the fourier transform of the triangle , Lecture17InterpolationMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,217,0,0,1938.430,19,20,signalprocessing,and you can see now that the reconstruction is somewhat smoother because of the fact that we're using an impulse response that's somewhat smoother or a corresponding frequency response that has a sharper cut off , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,88,0,0,1070.980,5,6,signalprocessing,in the demonstration the specific impulse response that is used for the digital filter or discreet time filter is the one that i show here , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,97,0,0,1153.040,10,11,signalprocessing,now the equivalent continuous time system in terms of the impulse response is of course a band limited interpolation of the impulse response associated with the discreet time filter , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,99,0,0,1186.290,20,21,signalprocessing,so in fact in the frequency domain and in the time domain related to the continuous time signal the associated impulse response is what i indicate here a band limited interpolation of the discreet time impulse response and time scale in fact , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,102,0,0,1220.630,12,13,signalprocessing,well the first thing that i'll want to look at is the impulse response , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,109,0,0,1302.170,12,13,signalprocessing,and so what we'll see after the low pass filter for the impulse response is a smooth curve like this , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,112,0,0,1325.610,8,9,signalprocessing,so first let's just look at the filter impulse response , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,113,0,0,1331.010,6,7,signalprocessing,what we see here is the impulse response of the overall system , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,114,0,0,1337.040,10,11,signalprocessing,and we observe for one thing that it's a symmetrical impulse response , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,116,0,0,1345.170,6,7,signalprocessing,we could also look at the impulse response before the desampling low pass filter let's take out the desampling low pass filter slowly and what we observe is basically the output of the digital to analog converter , Lecture18DiscreteTimeProcessingofContinuousTimeSignalsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,120,0,0,1388.570,4,5,signalprocessing,ok so that's the impulse response of the system , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,75,0,0,793.900,15,16,signalprocessing,and so the reconstructed signal is the convolution of the sample sequence and the filter impulse response , Lecture19DiscreteTimeSamplingMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,77,0,0,809.250,23,24,signalprocessing,and so it says then that the reconstruction is carried out by replacing the impulses here these impulses by versions of the filter impulse response , Lecture1IntroductionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,54,0,0,585.530,25,26,signalprocessing,and in dealing with systems and analyzing them what we will do is attempt to exploit some very specific and as we'll see very useful system properties , Lecture1IntroductionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,164,0,0,1744.450,25,26,signalprocessing,and beginning with the next lecture we will be much more specific and precise first discussing some basic signals and then talking about systems and system properties and how to exploit them , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,18,0,0,201.900,11,12,signalprocessing,specifically if we have a linear time invariant system with an impulse response h of t what we had shown is that that class of systems has the property that if we put in a complex exponential we get out a complex exponential at the same frequency and with a change in amplitude , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,19,0,0,227.100,23,24,signalprocessing,and this change in amplitude in fact corresponded as we showed as the discussion went along to the fourier transform of the system impulse response , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,26,0,0,297.040,14,15,signalprocessing,in other words the response to this complex exponential is the convolution of the impulse response with the excitation , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,37,0,0,406.660,19,20,signalprocessing,well in fact what that integral corresponds to is what we will define as the laplace transform of the impulse response , Lecture20TheLaplaceTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,38,0,0,418.860,21,22,signalprocessing,and in fact we can apply this transformation to a more general time function that may or may not be the impulse response of a linear time invariant system , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,23,0,0,290.330,30,31,signalprocessing,in particular the convolution property tells us that if we have a linear time invariant system the output in the time domain is the convolution of the input and the impulse response , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,24,0,0,304.390,17,18,signalprocessing,in the laplace transform domain the laplace transform of the output is the laplace transform of the impulse response times the laplace transform of the input , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,26,0,0,324.220,11,12,signalprocessing,in the case of the fourier transform the fourier transform the impulse response we refer to as the frequency response , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,27,0,0,332.430,18,19,signalprocessing,in the more general case with laplace transforms it's typical to refer to the laplace transform of the impulse response as the system function , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,30,0,0,373.640,22,23,signalprocessing,for example we know from previous discussions that there's a condition for stability of a system which is absolute integrability of the impulse response , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,31,0,0,385.390,16,17,signalprocessing,and that in fact is the same condition for convergence of the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,38,0,0,432.330,18,19,signalprocessing,well if in fact we have a system that's causal then that causality imposes the condition that the impulse response be right sided , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,57,0,0,598.020,18,19,signalprocessing,and so one over s plus a is the system function or equivalently the laplace transform of the impulse response , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,58,0,0,607.420,5,6,signalprocessing,so we can determine the impulse response by taking the inverse laplace transform of h of s given by one over s plus a , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,69,0,0,709.210,32,33,signalprocessing,so for example if the system was causal we would know that the region of convergence is to the right of the pole and that would correspond then to this being the impulse response , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,71,0,0,726.270,34,35,signalprocessing,i'm sorry with a positive if we knew that the system let's say was non causal then we would associate with this region of convergence and we would know then that this is the impulse response , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,109,0,0,1071.460,20,21,signalprocessing,and what this becomes is a second order system which as we'll see as the discussion goes on has an impulse response which oscillates with time and correspondingly a frequency response that has a resonance , Lecture21ContinuousTimeSecondOrderSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,115,0,0,1129.720,11,12,signalprocessing,and that corresponds to looking at the fourier transform of the impulse response which is the laplace transform on the j omega axis , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,13,0,0,145.640,9,10,signalprocessing,in particular it is the fourier transform of the impulse response , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,29,0,0,356.990,8,9,signalprocessing,now we have a mapping here from the impulse response to the amplitude or the eigenvalue associated with that input and this mapping is what is referred to as the z transform , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,30,0,0,376.130,12,13,signalprocessing,so h of z is in fact the z transform of the impulse response , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,31,0,0,383.060,30,31,signalprocessing,and if we consider applying this mapping as we did in continuous time in a similar argument applying this mapping to a sequence whether or not it corresponds to the impulse response or a linear time invariant system that leads then to the z transform of a general sequence x of n , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,35,0,0,436.570,27,28,signalprocessing,kind of the idea that if you look at the eigenvalue associated with a linear time invariant system that essentially generates a mapping between the sequence system impulse response and a function of z , Lecture22ThezTransformMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,186,0,0,1865.940,27,28,signalprocessing,so in fact if we looked at the fourier transform associated with this pole zero pattern if this was for example represented the z transform of the impulse response or a linear time invariant system the corresponding frequency response would be what i plotted out below , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,21,0,0,288.750,26,27,signalprocessing,in particular in the time domain a linear time invariant system is described through convolution namely the output is the convolution of the input and the impulse response , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,22,0,0,302.770,29,30,signalprocessing,because of the convolution property associated with the z transform the z transform of the output is the z transform of the input times the z transform of the impulse response , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,24,0,0,329.410,19,20,signalprocessing,in fact because of the relationship between the z transform and the fourier transform the z transform of the impulse response evaluated on the unit circle in other words for the magnitude of z equal to one in fact corresponds to the frequency response of the system , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,25,0,0,350.060,11,12,signalprocessing,more generally when we talk about the z transform of the impulse response we will refer to it as the system function associated with the system , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,31,0,0,435.510,23,24,signalprocessing,in particular recall from one of the early lectures way back when that stability for a system corresponded to the statement that the impulse response is absolutely summable , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,34,0,0,464.500,21,22,signalprocessing,so in fact the condition for stability of a system and the condition for convergence of the fourier transform of its impulse response are the same condition namely absolute summability , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,38,0,0,493.640,15,16,signalprocessing,consequently if the system is stable then the system function the z transform or the impulse response must also converge on the unit circle , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,39,0,0,505.210,4,5,signalprocessing,in other words the impulse response must have a fourier transform that converges , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,42,0,0,535.670,12,13,signalprocessing,in particular we know that if a system is causal then the impulse response is right sided , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,47,0,0,618.290,10,11,signalprocessing,if in fact the system was causal corresponding to an impulse response that's right sided this then would be the region of convergence of the system function , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,63,0,0,798.440,20,21,signalprocessing,so this factor that we have then must correspond to the system function or equivalently the z transform of the impulse response of the system , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,64,0,0,812.360,15,16,signalprocessing,in fact then if we have this z transform we could figure out what the impulse response of the system is by computing or determining what the inverse z transform except for the fact that expression is an algebraic expression and doesn't yet totally specify the z transform because we don't yet know what the region of convergence is , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,67,0,0,862.080,15,16,signalprocessing,that is specified by either explicitly because one way or another we know what the impulse response is or implicitly because we know certain properties of the system such as causality and or stability , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,68,0,0,880.130,25,26,signalprocessing,if i let's say imposed on this system in addition to the difference equation the condition of causality then what that requires is that the impulse response be right sided or the region of convergence be outside the outermost pole , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,75,0,0,957.320,10,11,signalprocessing,in any case given this region of convergence then the impulse response is the inverse transform of that z transform which is a to the n times u of n , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,124,0,0,1464.780,10,11,signalprocessing,correspondingly in the time domain there is a continuous time impulse response that maps to the associated discrete time impulse response , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,171,0,0,2037.000,37,38,signalprocessing,it's a very important useful method which kind of can be motivated by thinking along the lines of mapping the continuous time filter to a discrete time filter in such a way that the shape of the impulse response is preserved and in fact more specifically so that the discrete time impulse response corresponds to samples of the continuous time impulse response , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,173,0,0,2075.260,2,3,signalprocessing,so what impulse invariance corresponds to is designing the filter in such a way that the discrete time filter impulse response is simply a sample version of the continuous time filter impulse response with a sampling period which i denote here as capital t that will turn into a slightly confusing parameter shortly and perhaps carried over into the next lecture , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,175,0,0,2114.030,20,21,signalprocessing,remembering the issues of sampling the discrete time frequency response then since the frequency responses the fourier transform of the impulse response is related to the continuous time impulse response as i indicate here what this says is that it is the superposition of replications of the continuous time frequency response linearly scaled in frequency and shifted and added to each other , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,183,0,0,2208.200,14,15,signalprocessing,if we expand this in a partial fraction expansion and we look at the impulse response associated with this we know how to take the inverse of laplace transform of this where i'm just naturally assuming causality throughout the discussion the continuous time impulse response then is the sum of exponentials with these amplitudes and at these complex exponential frequencies , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,185,0,0,2241.570,5,6,signalprocessing,and so the discrete time impulse response is simply a sampled version of this , Lecture23MappingContinuousTimeFilterstoDiscreteTimeFiltersMITRES6007,206,0,0,2491.300,15,16,signalprocessing,but we know also that any time that we're sampling and here we're sampling the impulse response we have an effect in the frequency domain or the potential for an affect an effect that we refer to as aliasing , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,79,0,0,894.260,2,3,signalprocessing,now in impulse invariance as you recall it corresponds to generating an impulse response which is a sampled version of the continuous time impulse response and there is a temptation naturally to think all of this parameter capital t as necessarily identical to the sampling in the system in which the filter is going to be used , Lecture24ButterworthFiltersMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,89,0,0,1081.070,5,6,signalprocessing,we want the discrete time impulse response to be the continuous time impulse response sampled and for convenience i'm going to pick this parameter capital t equal to one , Lecture2SignalsandSystemsPart1MITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,292,0,0,2623.230,26,27,signalprocessing,and those together with the sinusoidal signals and exponentials as we've talked about today will really form the cornerstone for essentially all of the signal and system analysis that we'll be dealing with for the remainder of course , Lecture3SignalsandSystemsPartIIMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,141,0,0,1427.160,12,13,signalprocessing,so what i'd like to do now is turn our attention to system properties , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,45,0,0,567.140,28,29,signalprocessing,and it's generally useful to rather than carrying around h zero n just simply define h zero n as h n which is the unit sample or unit impulse response of the system , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,89,0,0,1060.380,3,4,signalprocessing,corresponding to the impulse response due to an impulse occurring at time tau , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,91,0,0,1074.580,24,25,signalprocessing,in particular if the system is time invariant then the response to each of these delayed impulses is simply a delayed version of the impulse response and so we can relate these individual terms , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,94,0,0,1117.090,34,35,signalprocessing,what we're left with when we do that is the description of a linear time invariant system through this integral which tells us how the output is related to the input and to the impulse response , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,107,0,0,1307.750,2,4,signalprocessing,there are properties of convolution which tell us about properties of linear time invariant systems , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,126,0,0,1518.100,6,7,signalprocessing,which i show here and the impulse response that we will convolve this with is a decaying exponential , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,142,0,0,1675.870,3,4,signalprocessing,again the same impulse response namely a decaying exponential and so we want to begin with h n k and again with n negative shown here , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,144,0,0,1697.390,14,15,signalprocessing,again on the bottom trace we'll show the result of the convolution as the impulse response slides along , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,147,0,0,1715.860,15,16,signalprocessing,basically the same as the output that we generated with a step input until the impulse response reaches a point where as we slide further we slide outside the interval where the rectangle is non zero , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,148,0,0,1733.490,22,23,signalprocessing,so when we slide one point further from what's shown here the output will now decay corresponding to the fact that the impulse response is sliding outside the interval in which the input is non zero , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,172,0,0,1958.300,5,6,signalprocessing,and again we use an impulse response which is a decaying exponential , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,184,0,0,2076.100,10,11,signalprocessing,that constant will be proportional to the area under the impulse response because of the fact that we're convolving with a step input , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,185,0,0,2099.270,16,17,signalprocessing,now let's carry out the convolution with an input which is a rectangular pulse again an impulse response which is an exponential , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,189,0,0,2147.040,7,8,signalprocessing,now as we slide further until the impulse response shifts outside the interval in which the pulse is non zero the output will build up , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,191,0,0,2169.700,2,3,signalprocessing,as the impulse response slides further and further corresponding to increasing t then the output will decay exponentially representing the fact that there is less and less area in the product of x tau and h t tau , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,200,0,0,2253.080,12,13,signalprocessing,the example of an input which is a unit step and an impulse response which is a real exponential multiplied by a unit step we have then replacing x k by what we know the input to be and h n k by what we know the impulse response to be the output is the expression that we have here , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,275,0,0,3098.950,11,13,signalprocessing,in the next lecture what we'll turn to are some general properties of convolution and show how this rather amazing representation of linear time invariant systems in fact leads to a variety of properties of linear time invariant systems , Lecture4ConvolutionMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,277,0,0,3122.690,13,15,signalprocessing,and what this leads to are some very nice and desirable and exploitable properties of linear time invariant systems , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,8,0,0,124.120,26,27,signalprocessing,then we'll turn to a discussion of what the characterization of linear time invariant systems through convolution implies in terms of the relationship of various other system properties to the impulse response , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,11,0,0,164.850,15,16,signalprocessing,tells us is how to relate the output to the input and to the system impulse response , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,13,0,0,181.320,28,29,signalprocessing,and i remind you also that we talked about a graphical interpretation where essentially to graphically interpret convolution required or was developed in terms of taking the system impulse response flipping it sliding it past the input and positioned appropriately depending on the value of the independent variable for which we're computing the convolution and then multiplying and summing in the discrete time case or integrating in the continuous time case , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,20,0,0,278.930,19,20,signalprocessing,and in fact in the lecture last time we worked an example where we had in discrete time an impulse response which was an exponential and an input which is a unit step , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,22,0,0,304.110,3,4,signalprocessing,and the system impulse response is the step , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,28,0,0,338.740,11,12,signalprocessing,in other words the text works the example where the system impulse response is a unit step , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,54,0,0,566.910,8,9,signalprocessing,and consider in particular a system with an impulse response h , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,58,0,0,595.020,8,9,signalprocessing,and that would correspond to a system with impulse response x and input h and output then h x , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,59,0,0,607.880,31,32,signalprocessing,so the commutative property tells us that for a linear time invariant system the system output is independent of which function we call the input and which function we call the impulse response , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,61,0,0,627.360,8,9,signalprocessing,we can interchange the role of input and impulse response , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,66,0,0,665.660,13,14,signalprocessing,to see this let's first consider the cascade of two systems one with impulse response h one the other with impulse response h two , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,72,0,0,718.160,22,23,signalprocessing,and so using the associative property we now can collapse that into a single system with an input which is x and impulse response which is h one h two , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,75,0,0,740.880,9,10,signalprocessing,and the commutative property says we could write this impulse response that way or we could write it this way , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,96,0,0,937.750,20,21,signalprocessing,and when we do that then we can recognize this as the output of a system with input x and impulse response which is the sum of these two impulse responses , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,98,0,0,955.240,11,12,signalprocessing,if we choose replace that interconnection by a single system whose impulse response is simply the sum of those impulse responses , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,100,0,0,980.530,15,16,signalprocessing,and we've seen so far in this lecture how convolution and the representation through the impulse response leads to some important implications for system interconnections , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,101,0,0,994.090,9,10,signalprocessing,what i'd like to turn to now are other system properties and see how for linear time invariant systems in particular other system properties can be associated with particular properties or characteristics of the system impulse response , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,105,0,0,1033.230,12,13,signalprocessing,and the question now is what are the implications for the system impulse response for a linear time invariant system , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,107,0,0,1045.440,6,7,signalprocessing,what are the implications on the impulse response if the system does or does not have memory , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,114,0,0,1102.740,13,14,signalprocessing,so the question then is what can we say about h t the impulse response in order to guarantee let's say that the output depends only on the input at time t , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,118,0,0,1156.500,4,5,signalprocessing,so we want the impulse response to be non zero at only one point , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,121,0,0,1173.400,13,14,signalprocessing,so if the system is to be memoryless then that requires that the impulse response be a scaled impulse , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,122,0,0,1183.020,2,3,signalprocessing,any other impulse response then in essence requires that the system have memory or implies that the system have memory , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,123,0,0,1194.210,13,14,signalprocessing,so for the continuous time case then memoryless would correspond only to the impulse response being proportional to an impulse , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,130,0,0,1253.370,6,7,signalprocessing,so let's consider a system with impulse response h input is x , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,131,0,0,1260.440,5,6,signalprocessing,and let's say that the impulse response of the inverse system is h i and the output is y , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,136,0,0,1304.630,15,16,signalprocessing,notationally by the way it's often convenient to write instead of h i as the impulse response of the inverse you'll find it convenient often and more typical to write as the inverse instead of h i h one , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,137,0,0,1325.500,7,8,signalprocessing,and we mean by that the inverse impulse response , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,148,0,0,1394.760,16,17,signalprocessing,and again we can tie that property directly to issues related in particular to the system impulse response , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,152,0,0,1421.850,40,41,signalprocessing,and i won't go through the algebra here it's gone through in the book is that a necessary and sufficient condition for a linear time invariant system to be stable in the bounded input bounded output sense is that the impulse response be what is referred to as absolutely summable , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,154,0,0,1456.300,8,9,signalprocessing,or in the continuous time case that the impulse response is absolutely integrable , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,158,0,0,1482.950,9,10,signalprocessing,so stability can also be tied to the system impulse response , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,195,0,0,1850.900,20,21,signalprocessing,in particular a necessary and sufficient condition for causality in the case of linear time invariant systems is that the impulse response be zero for t less than zero in the continuous time case or for n less than zero in the discrete time case , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,196,0,0,1874.630,11,12,signalprocessing,so for linear time invariant systems causality is equivalent to the impulse response being zero up until t or n equal to zero , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,201,0,0,1931.740,16,17,signalprocessing,to show the result in the other direction namely to show that if in fact the impulse response satisfies that condition then the system is causal , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,202,0,0,1943.860,33,34,signalprocessing,while i won't work through it in detail it essentially boils down to recognizing that in the convolution sum or in the convolution integral if in fact that condition is satisfied on the impulse response then the upper limit on the sum in the discrete time case changes to n , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,206,0,0,1995.380,12,13,signalprocessing,ok so we've seen how the impulse response or rather how certain system properties in the linear time invariant case can be converted into various requirements on the impulse response of a linear time invariant system the impulse response being a complete characterization , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,211,0,0,2055.429,4,5,signalprocessing,and in fact its impulse response is the accumulated values of an impulse , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,212,0,0,2061.370,2,3,signalprocessing,namely the impulse response is equal to a step , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,213,0,0,2067.650,10,11,signalprocessing,so what we want to answer is knowing what that impulse response is what some properties are of the accumulator , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,215,0,0,2081.420,5,6,signalprocessing,well we recognize that the impulse response is not simply an impulse , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,219,0,0,2100.050,2,3,signalprocessing,second the impulse response is zero for n less than zero , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,221,0,0,2115.180,14,15,signalprocessing,and finally if we look at the sum of the absolute values of the impulse response from infinity to infinity this is a step , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,234,0,0,2222.190,1,2,signalprocessing,the impulse response of the accumulator is a step , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,237,0,0,2243.800,1,2,signalprocessing,the impulse response of the accumulator is a step , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,243,0,0,2298.330,8,9,signalprocessing,and if we want to look at the impulse response of that we can then inquire as to what the response is with an impulse in , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,244,0,0,2306.830,14,15,signalprocessing,and what develops in a straightforward way then is delta n which is our impulse input minus delta n one is equal to the impulse response of the inverse system , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,257,0,0,2406.290,29,30,signalprocessing,and under the imposition of what's referred to as initial rest which corresponds to the response being zero up until the time that the input becomes non zero the impulse response is a n times u n , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,259,0,0,2436.550,23,24,signalprocessing,and likewise for a linear constant coefficient differential equation the specific one that i've indicated here under the assumption of initial rest the impulse response is e two t times u t , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,269,0,0,2543.610,6,7,signalprocessing,and so that means that the impulse response of an identity system is an impulse , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,276,0,0,2583.280,7,8,signalprocessing,and the implication there is that the impulse response of this is an impulse , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,277,0,0,2589.110,1,2,signalprocessing,the impulse response of this is an impulse , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,290,0,0,2699.030,10,11,signalprocessing,and since the limit of this would correspond to the impulse response of the identity system convolved with itself the implication is that not only should the top function this one correspond in its limiting form to an impulse but also this should correspond in its limiting form to an impulse , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,299,0,0,2777.500,5,6,signalprocessing,if i put in an impulse or if i talked about the impulse response what is that , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,316,0,0,2898.970,16,17,signalprocessing,and so if we have a system which is a differentiator and we inquire about its impulse response which let's say we define notationally as u one t , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,319,0,0,2925.690,14,15,signalprocessing,well the output of the differentiator is the convolution of the input with the impulse response , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,324,0,0,2958.740,16,17,signalprocessing,we'll define that as a function u two t u two t because we have this impulse response convolved with this one is u one t u one t , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,330,0,0,3014.800,16,17,signalprocessing,and the operational definition is through convolution where this corresponds to u k t being the impulse response of k differentiators in cascade , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,337,0,0,3073.260,15,16,signalprocessing,now to be complete we can also go the other way and talk about the impulse response of a string of integrators instead of a string of differentiators , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,338,0,0,3083.460,3,4,signalprocessing,of course the impulse response of a single integrator is a unit step , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,341,0,0,3100.290,14,15,signalprocessing,in particular if i take a string of m integrators in cascade then the impulse response of that is denoted as u sub minus m of t , Lecture5PropertiesofLinearTimeinvariantSystemsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,353,0,0,3254.910,19,20,signalprocessing,and we've seen a variety of properties representation through convolution and properties as they can be associated with the impulse response , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,77,0,0,858.870,19,20,signalprocessing,now if the system is a linear time invariant system it can as we know be described through its impulse response , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,78,0,0,866.260,18,19,signalprocessing,and as you've worked out previously in the video course manual for a linear time invariant system the impulse response is the derivative of the step response , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,81,0,0,896.850,8,9,signalprocessing,and a step in here then generates an impulse into our system and out comes the impulse response , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,82,0,0,904.600,46,47,signalprocessing,well just using the fact that these are both linear time invariant systems and they can be cascaded in either order then means that if we have the step response to our system and that goes through the differentiator what must come out again is the impulse response , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,83,0,0,924.570,8,9,signalprocessing,so differentiating the step response we get the impulse response , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,86,0,0,945.940,17,18,signalprocessing,and carrying that algebra through and using the fact that the derivative of the step is an impulse finally we come down to this statement for the impulse response , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,89,0,0,978.390,2,3,signalprocessing,and the impulse response then finally is an exponential of this form , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,91,0,0,991.640,17,18,signalprocessing,and recall that as we talked about previously a linear time invariant system is stable if its impulse response is absolutely integrable , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,92,0,0,1004.610,5,6,signalprocessing,for this particular case this impulse response is absolutely integrable provided that the exponential factor a is greater than zero , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,93,0,0,1019.290,8,9,signalprocessing,okay so what we've seen then is the impulse response for a system described by a linear constant coefficient differential equation where in addition we would impose causality linearity and time invariance essentially through the initial conditions of initial rest , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,138,0,0,1478.500,23,24,signalprocessing,and since we've imposed causality and if we're talking about a linear time invariant system we can now inquire as to what the impulse response is , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,139,0,0,1490.350,6,7,signalprocessing,and we know of course the impulse response tells us everything that we need to know about the system , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,141,0,0,1502.990,2,3,signalprocessing,so the impulse response is delta n corresponding to the x n up here plus a delta of this should be h n one , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,144,0,0,1520.640,4,5,signalprocessing,so we have the impulse response as delta n plus a times h n one , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,146,0,0,1533.235,2,3,signalprocessing,namely an impulse is zero for n less than zero the impulse response is likewise zero for n less than zero , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,154,0,0,1594.180,25,26,signalprocessing,and in fact what we can recognize by looking at this and how we would expect these terms to build we would see that the impulse response h n in fact is of the form a n times u n , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,155,0,0,1610.630,18,19,signalprocessing,and we also can recognize then that this corresponds to a stable system if and only if the impulse response which is what we just figured out if and only if the impulse response is absolutely summable , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,159,0,0,1662.860,9,10,signalprocessing,so here we have the causal linear time invariant impulse response , Lecture6SystemsRepresentedbyDifferentialEquationsMITRES6007SignalsandSystems,160,0,0,1669.330,4,5,signalprocessing,in fact with an impulse input all of the possible solutions are that impulse response plus the homogeneous solutions , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,5,0,0,67.850,17,18,signalprocessing,the idea was to exploit the notion of linearity by decomposing the input into a sum of basic inputs and then using linearity to tell us that the output can be represented as the corresponding linear combination of the associated outputs , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,6,0,0,85.880,28,29,signalprocessing,so if we have a linear system either continuous time or discrete time for example with continuous time if the input is decomposed as a linear combination of basic inputs with each of these basic inputs generating an associated output and if the system is linear then the output of the system is the same linear combination of the associated outputs , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,8,0,0,121.170,10,11,signalprocessing,so the strategy is to decompose the input into these basic inputs , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,10,0,0,135.960,13,14,signalprocessing,in particular for both continuous time or discrete time in this representation the basic inputs used in the decomposition are chosen first of all so that a broad class of signals could be represented in terms of these basic inputs and second of all so that the response to these basic inputs is in some sense easy to compute , Lecture7ContinuousTimeFourierSeriesMITRES6007SignalsandSystemsSpring2011,12,0,0,172.420,13,14,signalprocessing,the particular choice that we made in the discrete time case for our basic inputs was a decomposition of the input in terms of delayed impulses ,
