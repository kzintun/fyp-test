Error Handler
------------- 

loadALLXML - make sure only XML file are loaded
	   - show error message if there are no XML folder


sendToLucene - check whether the record already existed in the lucecne before indexing
	     - check 'word' and 'ids' fields together




Improve speed
-------------

extractXML - instead of calling the method to addIndex for every entry of xml
	   -  first store all the ids and words in 2D array
	   - then dump into lunce with one method call to addDoc
