Discrete-Time
Processing  of
Continuous-Time
Signals

One very important  application  of the  concept  of sampling  is its role  in pro-
cessing continuous-time  signals  using discrete-time systems. Specifically,  the
continuous-time  signal,  which  either  is  assumed  to  be  bandlimited  or  is
forced to be bandlimited by first processing  with an anti-aliasing filter, is sam-
pled  and the samples are converted to a discrete-time representation. The dis-
crete-time  signal may, for  example, represent  values  in successive  locations
in a digital memory. After being processed with a discrete-time system, the se-
quence  is "desampled"; that is, a continuous-time  signal is reconstructed, ide-
ally  through bandlimited  interpolation, by  converting the  sequence  to  an im-
pulse  (or  pulse)  train  followed  by  lowpass  filtering.  In  our  discussions  of
discrete-time  signals and systems, we have  made a point  of indexing them  on
an  integer variable  without  reference  to  a "sampling  period" since  discrete-
time signals arise  in a wide variety  of ways besides periodic  time sampling.
In converting the impulse train  of samples  to a sequence  of samples, we
are  in effect  normalizing  the  time axis. In the  previous  lecture  we  discussed
the  effect  of this  in  the  Fourier  domain,  concluding  that  the  discrete-time
Fourier transform of the sequence of samples is basically the same as the con-
tinuous-time  Fourier  transform  of the impulse  train resulting  after the  sam-
pler, with the exception  that the frequency  axis  is normalized. The  discrete-
time  sequence  is processed  by  a discrete-time  LTI  system  whose  frequency
response  is likewise represented  on a normalized frequency  axis. Converting
the filtered  output  sequence  back  to  a continuous-time  signal  can  be  inter-
preted  as  "unnormalizing"  the frequency  axis, with the  eventual  conclusion
that  the  overall  system  is  equivalent  to a  continuous-time  filter  whose  fre-
quency  response  is basically  the  same as  the  frequency response  of the  dis-
crete-time  filter with a linear scaling  of the frequency axis. Thus, for example,
if the  cutoff frequency  of the  discrete-time  filter  is one-tenth  of 27r,  then the

equivalent continuous-time  filter will have  a cutoff frequency that is one-tenth
of the sampling  frequency.  Because  of this  dependence  on the  sampling  fre-
quency,  with  a fixed  cutoff frequency  for  the  discrete-time  filter, the  cutoff
frequency  for the equivalent  continuous-time  filter  can be  varied by  varying
the  sampling  frequency.

In  this  lecture  a number  of the  points  mentioned  above  are  illustrated
through a demonstration. The  system demonstrated involves sampling  a con-
tinuous-time signal  and filtering the  resulting  sequences with a lowpass  filter
with  an  approximate  cutoff frequency  that  is one-tenth  of 21T.  The resulting
output  sequence  is  then used  to  reconstruct  a continuous-time  signal using
(approximately)  bandlimited  interpolation.  In the first part of the  demonstra-
tion, we show the impulse  response of the  system. In particular, the discrete-
time filter corresponds  to a linear-phase  filter with a finite  impulse response.
In  the  second  part of the  demonstration,  we  illustrate  the frequency  re-
sponse  of the  equivalent  continuous-time  filter by putting  a sinusoidal  signal
at the  input  and  observing the response  both as  a function of time  and  as a
function  of input  frequency.  It is  important  to note  that the system  demon-
strated does  not have  an  anti-aliasing  filter. Consequently,  as the  input  sinu-
soidal  frequency  increases past  half the  sampling  frequency,  aliasing  results
and  the  input  sequence  to the  discrete-time  filter  begins  to  decrease  in  fre-
quency  even though the frequency of the continuous-time  signal is increasing.
Thus, as we observe the overall  output as the  input sinusoid sweeps from zero
to half the  sampling  frequency,  the  output  moves through the  passband  into
the stopband.  As  the  input  frequency  increases  further, the  resulting  output
will  be  associated  not with  the  input  frequency  but  with the  aliased
frequency;  thus, as the input frequency  continues  to increase  we  will  see the
output behave  as though  the passband  is repeated. The two  consistent inter-
pretations  of this periodicity  in the frequency  response  are (1) that it is a con-
sequence  of aliasing on the input and (2)  that it is a consequence  of the period-
icity  of the discrete-time  filter. With  either  interpretation,  if  an  anti-aliasing
filter  had been  present  at  the  input,  all frequencies  above  half the  sampling
frequency  would  be rejected  before  the  sampler and  this periodic  repetition
of the passband  would not  occur.

In the third part of the  demonstration, we  illustrate the  way in which the
cutoff  frequency  of  the  overall  continuous-time  filter  is  dependent  on  the
sampling  frequency. Specifically,  since the equivalent cutoff frequency is one-
tenth  of the  sampling  frequency,  as the  sampling  frequency  increases  or  de-
creases, the equivalent cutoff frequency of the continuous-time  filter will also.
