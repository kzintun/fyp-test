Discrete-Time
Modulation

The  modulation  property  is basically  the  same for  continuous-time  and dis-
crete-time  signals. The principal  difference  is that since for discrete-time  sig-
nals the Fourier transform is a periodic function of frequency, the convolution
of the spectra resulting from multiplication  of the sequences is a periodic con-
volution rather  than a linear  convolution.

While the mathematics  is very similar, the applications are somewhat dif-
ferent. In continuous  time, modulation plays a major  role in communications
systems for transmission of signals over various types of channels. That appli-
cation  usually is inherently  a continuous-time  application. However, in many
modern  communication  systems,  signals  may go through  various  stages  and
types of modulation as they move from  one channel to another, and often this
conversion from  one modulation system to another is best implemented  digi-
tally. In their digital form the signals are  discrete-time signals, and such trans-
modulation  systems are  based on modulation properties associated with dis-
crete-time  signals.

In addition  to digital  modulation  systems, the  concepts  of discrete-time
modulation (and, for that matter, continuous-time  modulation  also) are useful
in the  context  of filtering, particularly  when it is of interest  to implement  fil-
ters  with a variable  center frequency.  It is often simpler in such situations to
implement  a fixed filter (either continuous  time or discrete  time) and through
modulation  shift the signal spectrum  in relation to the fixed  filter center fre-
quency rather than shifting the filter center frequency in relation to the signal.
For  discrete-time  signals,  for example,  from  the  modulation  property  it  fol-
lows  that  multiplying  a  signal  by  (-  1)'  has  the  effect  of  interchanging  the
high  and low frequencies.  Consequently,  by  alternating  the  algebraic  sign of
the input signal, processing  with a lowpass filter, and  then alternating the  al-
gebraic  sign of the output signal, a highpass  filter can be implemented.

In  discussing  continuous-time  modulation  in  Lecture  13  and  discrete-
time modulation  in  the first part of this lecture, the  emphasis  is  on a carrier
signal that  is a complex  exponential  or sinusoidal  signal. Another  important
and useful class of carrier signals is periodic pulse trains that are constant for
some  fraction of the period and  zero for the remainder.  In effect, then, either

in  continuous  time  or discrete  time,  modulation with  such a pulse  train  con-
sists of extracting time slices of the modulating  signal. In data representation
or transmission, this permits,  for example,  a type  of multiplexing  referred  to
as time  division  multiplexing  since  during  the  "off"  part  of the  pulse  train,
time slices  from  signals  in other  channels  can  be inserted.  Somewhat amaz-
ingly, the original  modulating  signal can  be recovered  exactly after  pulse-am-
plitude modulation provided only that the fundamental frequency of the carri-
er pulse  train  is  greater  than twice  the  highest frequency  in  the  modulating
signal.  The  modulating  signal can  then theoretically  be recovered  exactly by
filtering  the  pulse-amplitude-modulated  signal  with  an  ideal  lowpass  filter.
Furthermore,  this ability to exactly reconstruct the  original signal is  indepen-
dent of the "duty cycle" of the carrier, i.e., it is theoretically possible no matter
how  narrow  the "on"  time  of the  pulse  train is  made.  If for the  continuous-
time  case,  the  "on"  time  of the  carrier pulse  train  is made  arbitrarily  small,
with the  amplitude  increasing  proportionately,  the  carrier then  corresponds
to an  impulse  train. For discrete  time, the pulse  train  with the  smallest "on"
time  would likewise  correspond  to  a periodic  train of impulses or unit  sam-
ples. In both cases, then, modulation with the impulse train carrier would cor-
respond to sampling the modulating (input)  signal. This  leads to an extremely
important  concept, referred  to  as the sampling theorem. The  sampling theo-
rem states that a bandlimited signal can be exactly  reconstructed from  equal-
ly spaced time  samples  provided that the  fundamental  frequency  of the sam-
pler (i.e., the impulse train carrier) is greater than twice the  highest frequency
in the signal to be reconstructed. This fundamental and important result, to be
explored  further in Lecture  16, provides  a major bridge between  continuous-
time and discrete-time  signals and  systems.
