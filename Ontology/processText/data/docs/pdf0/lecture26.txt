Feedback Example:
The Inverted Pendulum

In this lecture, we  analyze  and demonstrate the  use  of feedback  in a specific
system,  the  inverted  pendulum.  The  system  consists  of  a  cart  that  can  be
pulled foward or backward  on a track. Mounted on the cart is an inverted pen-
dulum, i.e., a pendulum pivoted at its base and with the weight at the top. Con-
sequently, with the  cart stationary, the pendulum is unstable; even if balanced
in unstable  equilibrium,  any external  disturbance  will cause  the pendulum  to
fall.

To  balance  the pendulum,  the  cart can  be  moved  forward  or backward
under the weighted  rod. Thus, the forces acting  on the system are the cart ac-
celeration  and  any  external  disturbances.  In  principle,  if all  of the  external
disturbances  are  exactly  specified  (an  unreasonable  assumption)  and  if the
system dynamics  are precisely  understood, then the  cart acceleration  can be
specified  in  such a way  as to  maintain the  rod in a vertical  position. A  more
reasonable  approach  to balancing  the rod or, equivalently,  stabilizing this un-
stable  system,  however,  is  to  constantly  measure  the  angle  of the  rod  and
choose  the  cart  acceleration  based  on  this  measurement.  This  then  corre-
sponds to a feedback  system in which the measured angle is fed back through
an appropriate  choice  of feedback  dynamics to control  the cart acceleration.
We  carry  out  an  analysis  of the  open-loop  system  and  explore  several
possible  choices  for  the feedback  dynamics.  Under  the  assumption  that the
angular  displacement  of the rod  from perpendicular  is  kept small, the behav-
ior of the inverted pendulum  can  be described  through a second-order  linear
constant-coefficient  differential  equation,  or  equivalently  through  a system
function  with two  real-axis  poles,  one  in  the  left half of the s-plane  and  the
other in the right half of the s-plane, and therefore  associated with the system
instability. A first, more or less obvious,  choice  for the feedback  dynamics  is
to  simply  choose  the  cart acceleration  proportional  to  the  measured  angle.
The resulting system function  again has two poles, the positions of which are,
of course, dependent  on the feedback  gain. Examination  of the locus of these
poles as a function  of gain  (often referred to as the root locus) shows  that for
the  feedback  gain  negative,  the right half-plane  pole  moves even  further  into
the  right  half-plane  so  that the  instability  becomes  even  more severe.  If the
feedback  gain  is greater  than zero, as the  gain  increases  the two poles  move

toward  each  other, meeting  at the  origin  and then  traveling  along the  imagi-
nary  axis.  The  presence  of a  pole  in the  right half-plane  indicates  that  even
with a very small input (such as a small displacement of the rod), the rod angle
will  increase  exponentially.  With  the  poles  on  the  imaginary  axis,  any  dis-
placement  will result in an oscillatory behavior. Consequently, the system  re-
mains  unstable for  all values  of the feedback  gain.

A  second type of feedback to  consider  corresponds  to  choosing the  cart
acceleration  proportional  to  the  derivative of the angular  displacement.  This
choice is motivated  by the possibility that perhaps the pendulum  can be stabi-
lized by accelerating  the  cart  faster if the angular  displacement  is increasing
faster. Examination  of the root locus  with  derivative  feedback  demonstrates
again  that for the  feedback  gain  less than  zero the  system  becomes  increas-
ingly unstable  while with the  feedback  gain greater  than zero the  system  be-
comes  more stable but  is never  completely  stabilized. Finally, we  consider  a
combination  of proportional  plus derivative feedback, and  in this case by  ap-
propriate  choice  of the two  gain factors  the system  can  be stabilized.

The  demonstration  accompanying  this lecture,  besides being  entertain-
ing, is hopefully very instructive. In addition to showing that the system can  in
fact be stabilized by appropriate  choice of feedback, we  are able  to show that
feedback  is able  to  compensate  for  external  disturbances  and  to  changes  in
the  system  dynamics.
