Feedback

The tools that we have  developed  throughout this set of lectures provide the
basis  for a thorough  understanding  and  analysis  of linear  feedback  systems.
Feedback is a process that arises naturally in many practical situations, and it
is important to understand  how to analyze  and control  it. For example, feed-
back  is often a problem  in public  address  systems  in  which the output  from
the  audio  speakers  feeds  back  to  the  microphone.  If  the  feedback  is  too
strong, the  system  becomes  unstable,  resulting  in a  commonly  experienced
distortion. In many practical systems, linear feedback is purposely introduced
to  enhance  or control  some  aspect  of the  system  performance.  Feedback  is
often used in amplifier  design, for example, to compensate for a variety of un-
certainties  in  element  characteristics  such  as  frequency  response.  It  is  also
commonly  used in stabilizing unstable systems  or in control systems in which
certain  disturbances  and  parameters  cannot be  accurately  specified. For  ex-
ample,  in controlling  the flight  of a rocket or in positioning a telescope plat-
form, in theory  if all  of the  system parameters  and  dynamics  are completely
understood, the  positioning can be  accomplished  without feedback. The  use
of feedback, however, allows the positioning to be accomplished by adjusting
to zero  an error signal  corresponding  to the  difference  between  the  desired
and actual position. This  process results in control  or positioning that is sig-
nificantly less  sensitive to  specific system  parameters and  disturbances  than
would  be the  case with an open-loop  control  or positioning system.

In many  modern  control  systems,  it  is common  practice  to  use digital,
and  therefore  discrete-time,  control  in the  feedback  loop. This  becomes  one
very  important  application  for  discrete-time  feedback  systems.  There  are
many  other  natural  settings  in  which  linear  discrete-time  feedback  arises,
such as  population growth  in which, for  example,  certain factors  tend to re-
tard growth  as population  size  increases.

The basic tool for analyzing  linear feedback  systems is the Laplace  trans-
form  in continuous  time and  the z-transform  in discrete  time. In  both cases,
the basic feedback  equation  describing the overall  system function  of a feed-
back  system  in terms  of the  system  functions  in  the  forward  and  feedback
paths is the  same. However, the  conclusions  drawn  from this basic equation
relating to conditions  necessary  for the feedback  system  to be stable  are dif-
ferent: for  stability of the  overall  continuous-time  system we  require that the

system poles be in the left half of the s-plane,  while for stability of the  overall
discrete-time  system we require that the poles be inside  the unit circle.

As one illustration of the stability analysis  of continuous-time  linear feed-
back systems, we consider in this lecture the example  of feedback  in an audio
system.  One  conclusion  that we  can  readily  draw  from  analysis  of the  feed-
back equation for this system is that for stability, the combined gain of the for-
ward and feedback paths  must be less  than unity.

In the  next lecture, as a further  illustration of the  analysis of linear  feed-
back  systems,  we  will  consider,  analyze,  and  demonstrate  in  some  detail  a
system referred  to as the inverted pendulum.
