Mapping Continuous-
Time Filters to
Discrete-Time  Filters

In  Lecture 22  we introduced the z-transform.  In this lecture we  discuss some
of the properties of the z-transform and show how, as a result of these proper-
ties, the z-transform  can be used to  analyze  systems described  by linear  con-
stant-coefficient  difference  equations. Toward this end, the three most signifi-
cant properties  are the  linearity property, the  time-shifting  property, and the
convolution  property. As  a consequence  of the  convolution  property, the  z-
transform  of the output of an LTI system  is the  product of the z-transform  of
the  input and  the z-transform  of the system  impulse  response,  referred  to as
the system function. The  system function, for any specific value of z,  say zo,
corresponds also to the change  in (complex)  gain of the eigenfunction  zo as it
passes through the system. That is, H(z) represents the spectrum of eigenval-
ues  for  discrete-time  LTI  systems,  just  as H(s) represents  the  spectrum  of
eigenvalues  for continuous  time LTI  systems.

Based  on  the  linearity,  time-shifting,  and  convolution  properties,  apply-
ing the  z-transform  to  a linear  constant-coefficient  difference  equation  con-
verts  it  to an  algebraic  equation  that  can be  solved  for the  system  function.
Again, closely paralleling the discussion for continuous time, this specifies the
algebraic  expression  for the  system  function  but  does  not  explicitly  specify
the associated ROC. However,  if in addition the system is specified to be caus-
al, then  the ROC  must lie  outside the  circle  bounded  by the  outermost pole.
Alternatively, if the system  is known to be stable, the ROC  of the system func-
tion must include the unit circle. It then extends inward  and outward, in both
cases  until it reaches  a pole  (or the  origin  and/or  infinity). Typically  (but not
always)  in  discussing systems  described  by linear constant-coefficient  differ-
ence  equations, we  assume  causality  of the  system. Just as with continuous-
time systems,  first- and second-order  discrete-time  difference  equations  play
a  particularly  important  role  as  building  blocks  for  higher-order  difference
equations.

In  designing  a  discrete-time  system,  a variety  of  design  procedures  is
available  for  obtaining  a  linear  constant-coefficient  difference  equation  to

meet or approximate  a given  set of system specifications. One particularly  im-
portant  class  of  such  procedures  corresponds  to  mapping  continuous-time
designs  to  discrete-time  designs. This  approach  is motivated  in  part by  the
fact  that continuous-time  filter  design has  a long  and  rich history; to the  ex-
tent that well-developed  design  procedures  for  continuous-time  systems can
be  exploited  in the  design  of discrete-time  systems,  they should  be. Further-
more,  in  many  applications  discrete-time  systems  are  used  to  process  con-
tinuous-time  signals by exploiting the concepts of sampling. In such cases, the
discrete-time  system  to  be  designed  and  implemented  is closely  associated
with a corresponding  continuous-time  system.

An often used but not highly  desirable  approach  to mapping  continuous-
time systems to discrete-time  systems is to replace  derivatives in the differen-
tial  equation  describing  the  continuous-time  system  by  simple  forward  or
backward differences  to obtain a discrete-time  difference  equation. The  limi-
tations of this approach are perhaps  best understood  by examining the corre-
sponding  mapping  from  the  s-plane  to  the  z-plane,  from  which  it  is  evident
that the  frequency  response  can  be severely  distorted. In  addition, with the
use  of forward  differences,  unstable  discrete-time  filters  can result,  even
when the  continuous-time  filter from which it is  derived is stable.

A  second  approach  discussed is the impulse-invariant  design procedure,
whereby the  discrete-time  system  function  is determined  in such  a way that
the  impulse  response  of the  discrete-time  system  corresponds  to samples  of
the  impulse  response  of  the  continuous-time  system.  This  procedure  can
equivalently  be  interpreted  as a mapping  of the poles  of the  system function.
In  terms  of  the  corresponding  frequency  responses,  the  discrete-time  fre-
quency  response  is  identical  in  shape  to  the  continuous-time  frequency  re-
sponse  except for possible  distortion  due to  aliasing.  Consequently, it is  use-
ful  only  for  mapping  continuous-time  systems  for  which  the  frequency
response  is bandlimited.
