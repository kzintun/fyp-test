Continuous-Time
Second-Order  Systems

The properties  of the Laplace  transform  make it particularly  useful in analyz-
ing  LTI  systems  that  are  represented by  linear  constant-coefficient  differen-
tial  equations.  Specifically,  applying  the  Laplace  transform  to a  differential
equation converts it to an algebraic equation  relating the Laplace  transform of
the system output to the product of the Laplace  transform of the system input
and the Laplace  transform  of the system impulse response, referred  to as the
systemfunction. The system function is readily obtained by inspection of the
differential  equation,  and  the  system  impulse  response  can be  obtained  by
evaluating the inverse Laplace  transform  of the system  function. Alternative-
ly, the response  for any  other input  can be  evaluated by first multiplying  the
Laplace  transform  of the input  by the system function and then  applying the
inverse Laplace  transform.

Two  particularly  important  classes  of systems  described  by  linear  con-
stant-coefficient  differential  equations  are  first-order  and  second-order  sys-
tems. In  implementing higher-order  systems,  it is very  common  to use  first-
and second-order  systems as building blocks. Much of this lecture  focuses on
using the Laplace transform to describe the behavior of these building blocks.
First-order  systems  are represented  by  a  single  pole  in the  s-plane, and
second-order  systems by a pair of poles. There may or may not also be zeros
in the transfer  function, depending  on whether  there  are derivative  terms  on
the right-hand side of the differential equation. From the differential  equation,
the system function can be written directly. If we assume that the systems are
causal, so that the impulse response is right-sided, then the ROC of the system
function is implicitly  specified  to be  to the right of the rightmost  pole  in the
s-plane.

For second-order systems, the poles may be either on the real  axis in the
s-plane or off the real axis as a complex conjugate pair, depending on the spe-
cific  relationship  between  the coefficients.  When both poles  are  real-valued,
the system is often referred to as overdamped, and when they occur as a com-
plex-conjugate pair the system is referred to as underdamped. In the time do-
main, the underdamped  case corresponds to an oscillatory impulse response
with an exponential  damping. The  time constant  of the  damping  is related to

the  real part  of the pole  locations, and  the  oscillatory  behavior  is associated
with the  imaginary part. As the  poles move closer  to the jo-axis  the damping
decreases, and as the poles move parallel to the jo-axis the oscillatory behav-
ior changes  in frequency.

Many  of the  properties  of the  frequency response  of a system  can  be  in-
ferred  from  inspection  of the  pole-zero  pattern  of the  system  function. Since
the Laplace  transform  reduces  to the Fourier transform for  s =jw,  the behav-
ior of the system function on the jo-axis corresponds  to the  system frequency
response.  By  considering  the  behavior  of  the  associated  vectors  in  the  s-
plane, we  can  infer the behavior  of the frequency  response  for underdamped
second-order  systems.  In particular,  the  frequency  response  tends  to have  a
peak  for the  underdamped  case, and  as the  poles  move closer  to the jo-axis
this peak becomes increasingly  sharp. The  frequency  location  of this peak  or
resonance  is  closely  associated  with  the  frequency  of oscillation  of the  im-
pulse response, and the width of the peak is closely associated with the damp-
ing of the oscillations.

Since  higher-order  transfer  functions  can  always  be  decomposed  into  a
product  or  sum of first-order  and  second-order  transfer  functions,  these are
important building blocks  for more general systems. One illustration  of this is
the use of second-order  systems in speech synthesis. The use of second-order
underdamped systems to simulate the resonances  of the vocal tract for gener-
ating synthesized  speech is discussed  and illustrated  in this lecture.
