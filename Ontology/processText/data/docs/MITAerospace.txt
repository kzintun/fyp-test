professor hoffman asked me to step in today to talk about the space shuttle and the military
i'm going to do that
i encourage questions
i may not be able to answer all your questions either because a i don't know or b i cannot say
i am going to leave it to you to figure out which one is which
i would like to say a few things before i start
one is i'm not a historian so i'm not here to give a history of the military and the shuttle
i am here to give you my experiences with it which is a very select data slice i think as you will see
second the things i say here although we're going to tape them i have to very carefully
and third i really speak from a different era
i speak from an area of the seventy s and early eighty s when the political situation was a lot different than it is today
when a cold war was hot
when there was a real threat of a massive land war plus worse in northern europe
when there were real threats of nuclear exchanges between the super powers
things which are not true today thank goodness
we have now been overcome by other threats and challenges but i speak really from an era of the seventy s and eighty s
so with that i would like to start
again i encourage questions
here is what i would like to do today
i would like to give you a little bit of intro and background
talk about dod and air force space missions
there is a difference which i shall highlight
i will talk about military system requirements and impacts on the space shuttle as a system
i will talk about facility impacts because that is easy to do but there are impacts that are far more far reaching than that
i will close a little bit on national space policy and then i will show you a ten minute video
for the video i would like tom to turn off the recording and we will just watch it kind of in silence
ok
any questions
my background is i served twenty nine years in the air force
as you folks know you can retire up to twenty so i couldn't count
i stayed far longer than i should have
the reason i stayed was because the air force gave me assignments i could not turn down
i have had lots of experience from a program office payload user perspective on shuttle
titans off both coasts mx pegasus xl
last january i gave a talk which i will repeat this year on my activities on two accident investigations
one on titan iv and one on pegasus
i do that at one time
it takes about an hour and a half
if any of you are on campus in january please come by
it's an interesting story
i served in multiple program offices in programs a and b
programs a and b are subsets of the nro
i won't say any more about that but program a is the air force element
program a not only built air force satellites for the intelligence community they also provided all the launch services for the intelligence community
i have been director of two major programs
the first one space based infrared low
the second one was the dod space test program
i have also been the nro director of safety
in general air force and dod space missions fall into this laundry list
the first one is navigation which you know from gps communication which has many satellites of which nelstar and dscs are the ones you recognize
dscs was launched on the space shuttle i believe twice i'm not sure
meteorology the air force launches the dmsp which is the polar orbiting weather satellite now replaced now by the npoess system
for missile launch detection the intelligence community and the air force have either operated the dsp satellite system or else proposed svrs which is suffering tremendous programmatic problems currently
for arms free verification it is terribly important to have complied at one time with limitations
that is an interesting slice of history where at one time the total number of warheads
total number of bombers submarines ships this sort of thing was limited by international agreement but it was the responsibility of the other side to verify compliance
there is also nuclear weapons test detection on vela
and then a whole handful of what i call intelligence community or ic programs
bob siemens a retired professor emeritus is planning to drop by today for the q and a
his position his role in this story is really very central
his influence is woven throughout the whole story of the dod and the space shuttle and i hope you will get a chance to talk to him
an extremely interesting and very pivotal guy
i would like to concentrate on vandenberg air force base right up on the eastern range for the space shuttle because the vandenberg air force base launch site was really built up for sun synchronous polar orbits for really one payload and that was the fellow here depicted in the late one thousand nine hundred seventy s launching out of the western range
this is a titan iiid
i have helped launched i think eight of these off the west coast
this is a heavy lift machine
it is roughly thirty thousand pounds in low earth orbit twenty seven thousand to thirty point zero
it has two solid strap ons
i saw the first one go in one thousand nine hundred seventy and subsequently was able to transition into the program office to launch several times out of there
as some of you are aware because i have talked to you out of class i served for many years not in what we call the regular air force but what is called the office of special projects
it is called an air force element
we did not report for the usual chain of command through the air force chains
we went straight up to the secdef of the jcs
we were given the responsibility to launch things quickly quietly with great national pressure
and we did that
and the machines we used to launch payloads included are titans of various kinds atlases as well as the space shuttle
the story i am going to tell you is really the special projects utilization of the shuttle
more so than what i call the regular air force missions
in any case when i joined safsp in the late one thousand nine hundred seventy s life was really exciting
we were in the midst of phasing out all the expendables for the space shuttle
and when i went in there i found within the first week they said the space shuttle is designed for our program because we were flying on a regular basis out of the western range
so the payload that sits inside here is a form fit and function drop in in the space shuttle bay
at the time there were no space shuttle payloads of that size yet on the drawing boards
the intent was to have a seamless transition from titans into space shuttle first for our program and then for others
we drove the payload bay size as you've heard from professor hoffman and aaron cohen fifteen point sixty
the cross range requirement dictated the configuration of the vehicle plus the wing size because the air force and the dod was very very insistent on having a return to launch base capability
first orbit deploy come back cross range land back at vandenberg recycle be ready to go hopefully in a matter of days
it is interesting to note the evolution of the titan space launch family
in the one thousand nine hundred seventy s we pick it up with the titan iiid we see here
the three e was a transtage version used for basically out of space missions
this is a commercial version
but the dod use went from the thirty four b three c thirty four d through this family here and now we see the four a and the four b which are the heavy lift guys
these guys basically were the follow on to shuttle
they lifted the shuttle payloads that the shuttle could not carry
and i will explain that in a few minutes
very large expensive complex machines complex programs
at vandenberg it turns out that back in the sixty s there was a program called the manned orbiting laboratory mol
many of the original space shuttle mercury astronauts were part of that
they built up a space lodge complex up there called slick six to launch the mol
it was going to be a space capsule with military officers onboard to do recognizance and surveillance flying off a rather large titan iiic
to do that again back in the sixty s they built a launch pad
i'm sorry
as we got ready for the shuttle they took the mol things and did all these things to it to make it shuttle ized
they operated a launch pad
they put in a mobile service tower
as you know at the cape what they do is kind embrace the shuttle and its stack with a gantry
and they pull back a little bit and then they launch
the mobile service tower is a large almost like a skyscraper complex that completely encloses the rocket during processing and then rolls back several hundred yards to expose the vehicle for launch a totally different ops concept
this facility here the omcf is similar to the ksc orbiter processing facility
then they have other facilities here
the payload preparation room where the payloads are received from transportation put together and tested
the pcrs were the payloads actually put into the shuttle bay
the vandenberg runway was almost doubled in length
and then all this infrastructure is put in here including crew quarters for the astronauts
and they were able to reuse the mol facilities
a lot of
but what you see here is the buildup of a complex very similar to cape kennedy only on a california coast
very very elaborate very very complicated very expensive and taking a tremendous amount of budget to go do it
back in the seventy s by law or by policy which is perhaps even more powerful the space shuttle was going to be the only launch system for all military civil and commercial payloads
this is somewhat of a forgotten fact but at one time the cry went out from the advocates that said by having a reusable spacecraft that can launch twenty five point thirty times a year from both coasts so that is times two we can do great things
and certainly coming from the folks that gave us apollo this did not seem that farfetched
the idea of launching a spacecraft like an airliner as we know did not happen in our generation
i think in your generation if you can make that happen that would be extremely wonderful
but at one time there was going to be a phase out a shutdown of all the launch vehicles
all the launch vehicle folks were told fly out what you have close up business break up your tool and dies send your people home we are going to go with shuttle
and to do that there was extensive redesign of payloads to fit the payload bay the width the length to fit the safety requirements
all these things changed
so it was not just a matter of just taking your existing payloads for these guys and dropping them into the shuttle payload bay
it was a huge engineering effort
and we thought at one time this is the way it is going to be forever
the things that are unique about this is first of all liftoff and flight loads are much different because of not only the main events everything from the srbs the staging but also being able to survive safely things like slap down on landing if you had to come back home with a payload
many of the heavy payloads require as you know upper stages
the pams are the small payload assist module small upper stages
the iuss as you probably heard are much much more elaborate solid fuel devices
the shuttle center cryo center was going to be a cryogenic upper stage that was going to take our biggest payloads up to geo
that never got through the safety process but they worked it hard
the safety requirements to make sure that the crew was not endangered at any time by anything either accidental or inadvertent or a mishap were huge
that is a whole separate discussion in itself which i will be glad to have with you but basically everything was looked at in terms of being dual fault tolerant so that in no case could any two events link up to cause hazard to the crew even including accommodation of hardware and software errors
this was huge and caused in many cases extensive retests and redesign of payload systems
national space policy back in the seventy s and eighty s
first of all in seventy eight there was strong endorsement for the space shuttle to be the prime mover for national security and civil missions
what is missing from this lineup here
commercial
there were very few almost no commercial missions at the time
civil means nasa
the launch business of that time was dominated by the government nasa and the dod one thousand nine hundred eighty two the position was strengthened
and by the way i suggest if you haven't already to look up these documents
national space policy is voiced in these documents
it is extremely powerful
it is the basis for programs
it is the basis for legislation
it is the basis for budgets
it is huge
every word in these documents is worked over at great length by all the competing stakeholders and it is big
but in eighty two scs was going to be the primary launch for national security in civil missions
what that really meant was anybody else with a rocket was told you're in the wrong list don't come back
then we had challenger
and in one thousand nine hundred eighty eight there was now a directive
a one thousand nine hundred eighty eight pd that said we shall have a mix between man and unmanned launch systems
this is in contradiction to this i'm sure as you notice
an nspd four in one thousand nine hundred eighty one now gave us the words assured access to space code words
anybody here care to tell me what that really means in plain english anybody
yes
even if the space shuttle won't fly they want to have some alternatives
that's right
it says don't put all your eggs in one basket
have two ways to get to space for your heavy payloads
this is authorization for what we now know as the eelv
but also at the time shortly after challenger pete aldridge who was secretary of the air force at the time now an executive of the aerospace corporation previously the director of the nro prior to challenger in the eighty four eighty five time period started getting a little bit antsy about access to space because of all the delays in the shuttle launch manifest
and so he authorized on his own authority a start up of the titan fleet again
this led to huge problems with nasa because what they saw that as correctly was a loss of support for the space shuttle program
but he did that
and when the challenger disaster occurred in eighty six the air force was about eighteen to twenty four months ahead of where they would have been
here is doctor siemens
hi bob
hi pete
you want to sit over here
i would like to have you meet doctor bob siemens
and he will be here for the q and a afterwards
bob i'm just going over some of the national space policy
write ups that kind of led to where we are today
this was nsc thirty seven
this was nsc forty two the primary launch
this was the post challenger mix between the manned and unmanned systems
and then this was the assured access to space presidential declaration
from a user perspective the security requirements to fly on shuttle were huge
what was required to be protected was any information on the mission type and details
leo geo heo you name it that could not leak out
any information on the spacecraft who made it where it was supposed to go of course what the payload did had to be protected
also protected was the program office and the prime contractors because often you can tell from that who does what
and during operations the deployment time location and the final payload orbit had to be protected
this is huge
as you know thousands of people participate in getting a mission together for the shuttle
it starts with a mission planning template that is roughly two to three years prior to flight
it goes all the way through preparation of the flight plans the mission rules the launch constraint documents the processing and finally the on orbit ops
all that had to be protected
and that was big
it was a huge and expensive philosophy
it was called the control mode security system
it took a lot of effort from all parts and was almost airtight
yes a question
was this for every shuttle mission or just dod payloads
no this is for what i call the intelligence community dod missions
if you go back and look on the shuttle manifest and i am not going to do it for you but you can do it if you want you will see a number of missions where they will say dod mission payload type not unknown but not available na
also the dod air force missions were all military astronauts
that is felt to be a safe thing to do
for implementation of encrypted voice data and commanding links starting really with the testing at the launch sites but also going through the flight ops
i mention all these things having been involved in the safety certifications
i will say that was long and arduous
the safety review process has to be extremely extremely thorough starting early on
it is not just a whitewash of what the hardware is that comes with the pad
in many cases it changed the design of the spacecraft the design of its deployment systems and things like that
to protect classified information there also had to be need to know access to program details
this was a major major set of impacts to the space shuttle system and payload mission
all these areas which i can talk to you about at great length afterwards
i will say thought that when i do get back to jsc or when i talk to my nasa friends they all say they were proud to have been on those missions
they were all hooked together on missions of great national importance
to the best of my knowledge security has held tight over all those years despite all the people who were cleared of the programs
and the programs were extremely successful as a result
yes
you said all military crews
does that mean active military or people who have been transitioned to the regular astronaut corp from the military
these are military folks who transitioned to the astronaut corp yes
there were also impacts of the air force satellite communication networks
as you know these are the worldwide set of tracking stations that were going to be replaced by tdrs
that is an interesting story
the selling point for tdrs was they would shut down the afscns which were getting old and were very labor intensive
well we still have them both today
worldwide network scattered around the world but to provide secure shuttle communication there had to be extensive upgrades because working with the shuttle with a complicated payload in orbit getting it initialized tested and deployed was something new for the scn
the scn ordinarily just did space to ground data transfers through orbiting satellites
so to be working with a human crew and human system to have all the contingencies in place was big
the scns were involved in the all the prelaunch testing and commanding health and status checks as well as all the deployment and post deployment payload communications
i wish i could show you the contingencies all the workarounds the plan as the plans bs required for a complicated mission
it is immense
it takes a long time to do it right
the point is that when you're ready to fly you should be ready for all know contingencies
even up to loss of communication failure of critical computer systems and that sort of thing
you never want to fly and have to scratch your head and say what should we do next
pre first flight issue was an sts one
another mit professor gene covert who is also here and someone you should really talk to at some point in time was part of our panel that reviewed space shuttle main engine quality testing
and they were the folks that really came to grips with this new and emerging issue called turbine micro cracks
the turbine blades in the ssme were found to be developing very small cycle dependent micro cracks
the question came up what is the ultimate failure mode
how many cycles can they stand
how good are they good for
the original intent as you know was to be able to re fly the ssmes with zero maintenance between flights many times
that hasn't happened
but even the question of would it be good even for one mission was a big big question
and gene who is an extremely thorough manager and engineer a lot of common sense a lot of smarts worked that very very hard
there were also issues of course about thermal tile loss
there were questions about whether those would fall off
this is not ice now
this is thermal tiles
and at the same time there were huge costs growing in the development of the ius the shuttle centaur upper stage and also vandenberg facilities
everything was either late and or over cost
many folks thought that the ius would never fly because the development problems were so huge
the fact that it has flown as many times as it has on a variety of launch platforms is truly amazing from my sight
and we also saw prior to first flight several delays two and a half years is about right
and then more delays ensued
and so from a user perspective all these delays really added up to lost opportunities extensive cost growth and things like that really a heartbreaking story
this is a picture of a defense satellite program dsp
a machine lifting out of the shuttle bay
i think you have seen this
this is the ius turntable that rotates the vehicle up and pushes it out with springs
this is a two stage solid misconfiguration that takes the beast out to geosynch
post challenger the space policy was changed
the shuttle was not to be used anymore for lifting all satellites but only for mission where human presence was required
but there was a problem
because of the backup of missions the scs had to fly out the existing dod payloads
we looked very hard at converting them back to the titans
since we were taking steps to shut down the titan line the titans weren't ready at that time
but what we saw afterwards was increased use of a restart really of these efforts modernizations
and that was interesting because there was always the chance the shuttle could come back and launch hopefully fifteen point twenty times a year
and we hoped it would happen but it never did
steven dorfman from hughes was here as a visiting professor several years ago
he was extremely bitter about the fact that from a satellite manufacturing point of view he had to eat the cost to switch back to extendables from shuttle
first he was told by national space policy thou shalt fly on space shuttle then he was told you are now bared from flying that space shuttle a huge lost to him
and i think hughes is still contesting it
i don't think it will ever win that in court
and kind of most importantly from a central california point of view the vandenberg shuttle facilities were shut down completely
my dod scs mission involvement personally was i worked on the very first dod sponsored mission sts four
it was columbia launched in late june of eighty four flown by ken mattingly and hank hartsfield
this was a pathfinder for the dod
it was a test not only of the security procedures but also the ability to do launch operations orbital operations in a classified way
it came out truly successfully
we learned a lot
it was not easy
getting any complicated mission to fly on the shuttle is a very very difficult process
to do it under the cloak of security makes it even harder
i was a primary dod launch integrator the interface between the program office and the air force for two primary missions
i shadowed three others
i was also member of the nasa dod safety review team
this was interesting
the safety review team or srt was a very small streamlined fast moving team that basically reviewed and bought off on the payload
as opposed to having the figurative casts of thousands we had a cast of just a very small number of people both from the dod and the nasa side
and we moved as quickly as we could to get these missions approved and bought off
and lastly in the mid ninety s i was a program manager for the dod space test program
stp is in existence today
their charter is to be the sponsor for space experiments with military relevant
they flew among other things the first atomic clocks that led to gps as we know it today
they continue to fly numerous secondary and piggyback missions not just on shuttle but also on ariens russian vehicles korean vehicles indian vehicles
when i was the manager of the program it was great
it was like you were running a big used car lot and you were offering rides to everybody
it was terrific
the emphasis here is to use excess launch capacity to fly space experiments that you would screen every year
and then on rare occasions you would build a dedicated satellite and launch vehicle about every four years to launch the bigger satellites
my summary is that the dod had requirements that really went back to the first years the first days of the shuttle program
they were extremely demanding and dramatically affected the architecture of the space shuttle system
the heartbreak of course as we know is that we never were able to achieve the launch rates and the low recurring costs that were promised
that really when we realized it was slipping away those were truly sad days
i don't think anyone ever anticipated the one time expenses and effort required to redesign payloads
not just for mechanical form fit function but also for safety
no one realized the extensive work required to certify the payloads for manned operations
the mission integration at the cape was very complicated and security as you can tell permeated everything
and lastly the sad thing is that mol and scs at vandenberg all suffered from the curse of slick six which was that both programs were cancelled despite millions of dollars put into refurbishing the facilities
i have here a list of references
heppenheimer's book development of the space shuttle i found was quite good
it talks a lot about the programmatics of the space shuttle
i hope you've had a chance to read it
i took some information from here
the federation of america scientists the fas site is interesting
i think it is still current on the space shuttle
and there are these books here which i point you to give you a little bit more insight into the missions the roles of the intelligence community doing things such as flying and operating satellites in space
if there are any questions i will be glad to take them now and then i will show a short ten minute video
how am i doing on time
i'm moving fast
yes question
how many times was the
was it even used to launch the shuttle
slick six never saw anything launched out of there until they launched a lockheed low cost machine called the athena in about one thousand nine hundred ninety six
presently the delta four remember the big machine that flew out of the cape about nine months ago is stacked there at slick six ready to go with an operational payload
they are having big concerns though about fuselage so their launch date which was going to be last week has been rolled off to the right several months
they had a problem on the first flight of basically fuel cavitatation
and they are not happy with it yet
it is ready to go
when the delta four launches out of slick six it will be the first large payload system to go out of there for the first time
question
yes
i don't know if it is really fair but in hindsight was it worth it for the military to get onboard with the shuttle from the military's perspective
well if the promises had been kept it certainly would have been worthwhile
with the way things have turned out was it worth it
we were kind of driven into it
can you say was it worth it from a cost point of view from a schedule point of view
the answer is no
i think from the perspective of having people do extremely difficult tasks under very pressing circumstances it showed us what nasa and the air force could do although at a great cost
it was certainly one of the more i will say exciting times
it was one of the more exciting times for nasa
questions
yes
when you talked about safety certifying these payloads was it mainly an issue of the fuel supplies for the payloads
well i will just give you one example
to get a payload into the bay and withstand launch loads you have to have very large structural members steel rods for example that had to take all of the launch loads and not have the satellite break away inside the payload bay in the worst case either during liftoff or in the worst case on landing
you could have as many as eighteen to twenty four steel bolts that all had to be fractured simultaneously within seconds by pyrotechnics to get them out
you had to prove by analysis and by test that you could have these simultaneous events for which you could not have any redundancy
you just couldn't do it
these were must work devices
as probably professor hoffman has told you on every shuttle launch there is a large number of must work category one issues and items
like the bolts that free the external tank from the vehicle if those don't work you've got a big problem
from a safety certification point of view on the shuttle we had to make sure that in no case could the payloads pose any hazard to the crew under any circumstances including the ones that are the most farfetched such as landing overseas in spain or morocco
but the things we were worried about was having a payload hung up during deployment so the shuttle couldn't return or a payload damaging the shuttle at any time and causing obviously big problems there and things like that
plus things such as propulsion systems accidentally activating
liquid solids it didn't matter all extremely hazardous
and we found out a lot because it is one thing to design a payload for launching an expendable
there are certain things that you can or should not do
but when you go to a shuttle context we have a lot of commanding going into the vehicle
pre flight during assent and ops it becomes a much more tough a problem
for example i will just give one example
if you have a very complicated payload which consists of a spacecraft bus all the housekeeping and the payload front end which may have all kinds of hazards associated with it like antenna booms that come out on command how do you verify final configuration before you liftoff
how do you know every system is in the state that you think it is
how do you verify that
that is very hard
because you can go in there with test equipment but test equipment has subtleties all its own
ok
questions
do you think it would be possible to do the one orbit and return to base type mission
it sounds very difficult to do
it is not that hard
first orbit deploys were not easy but they were done
coming back i think the big problem is that it really forces the timelines
because as you know to do a de orbit burn and return to earth it requires quite a bit of mission planning real time updates to verify you're on the right track plus making sure that you have everything right so when you do the de boost you're going to be within your corridors
to the best of my knowledge nasa has never done a first orbit return
and i don't think they would want to
it's very stressing because in ninety minutes you have to not only get the spacecraft out
but then the vehicle re safed and buttoned up and planned out to land back either at the primary or an alternate landing site
that's a lot of work to do in ninety minutes
any other questions
yes
is there any way to give a ballpark figure of how many dod payloads can be put in space by the shuttle
ten or hundreds
oh not it's not hundreds
the nasa manifest is published
from what they call a regular air force site they launched a whole series of communication satellites dscs dsp
in fact the very last dsp satellites are still shuttle compatible and could be launched if there was a problem with the titans
they are up there in storage in southern california
and then there are a fairly large number of what are called intelligence community missions that are flown
and all the manifest will say is that these were just dod missions
let's see
what i would like to do is ask tom to shut off the videotape and i will give you a little introduction to my video which i hope will run
we are ready to start her folks
bob siemens is really a very pivotal person not only in the space shuttle story but also in the apollo program which he can probably talk to you at a separate time
but i think he will like to spend ten or fifteen minutes talking about his role in the space shuttle story
ok
here we go
i'm just wondering where to go to get comfortable
can we turn that off
we cannot
all right
i would just like to get comfortable here
you know as pete said first of all i thought that was a great summary of actually a very difficult subject to discuss
let me just take you back first of all to the early sixty s
i know that is going awful far back but that was when i joined nasa as a general manager
and before we knew it we had gone from a billion dollar a year operation with the mercury program to a situation where we were given the assignment of putting men on the moon
and that was a gigantic shift in our responsibility
and in all of the planning and the discussions and so on and we did work very closely with the department of defense the department of defense had all kinds of assets that were going to be required in the space program
the navy for example to pick up the astronauts
one example a major example most people never heard of was we had to construct very large facilities
the most famous and obvious is the vertical assembly building and the large facility down at the cape
you just saw the shuttle taking off from that facility
and in operating down there at the cape there already was cape canaveral
and there was not room for what we were going to do to fit on cape canaveral
we looked at seven different world sites and finally decided to camp on merritt island which is just across the river from cape canaveral because again the department of defense had all kinds of facilities down there with a tracking range and so on
but the biggest support that we got was in the building of those facilities
there was absolutely no confidence in nasa to build the largest structure in the world the vab or many other facilities for assembly and for tests and so on
the corp of engineers was a major part of the operation
i am bringing this out because we had to figure out how far we were going to go with our launch vehicles on a shared basis
this is before anybody thought of a manned shuttle that would carry stuff up and stick it into orbit
but we put together a planning organization that actually operated for over a year's time
a fellow named golivan for nasa a fellow named cavanaugh for the department of defense put this together
one of the big emphases was the use of the titan
the titan was coming along to the point where we thought that the earliest version would be suitable for the mercury program
and at that time in one thousand nine hundred sixty one we were thinking that mercury only weighed three thousand pounds
you could put one man in it
you couldn't do much with it
but if we could in effect just enlarge it and have a more powerful vehicle an atlas
namely the titan we could really have a vehicle that would have some capability to run through a lot of the orbital operation and so on that we're going to ultimately be required for going to the moon
and out of that came the planning for the titan iii the titan iv and vehicles that proved right off the bat and over time they still are very important to our defense capability
well i don't think that is quite true
i don't think we are using any of those assets today within nasa
and if you then go forward in time in one thousand nine hundred sixty eight i have been down there in nasa for seven point five years
i planned to go down for two
i came back
mit was nice enough to invite me back and i came back right here as a hunsaker professor
to my very great amazement i got a call one day from somebody i had never met a man named mel laird
i just barely knew that he had been designated by nixon to be the next secretary of defense
he said are you going to be down here in washington the next day or two
as a matter of fact i was because i was going to go down the next day to get on a plan and fly down and see the launch of apollo eight which was going to fly around the moon
and he said come on for lunch
that is when he asked if i would be the willing to be the secretary of the air force
i told him that was absolutely impossible
we just moved our family back here
my wife is in the hospital which she was
but he was very persistent
and after about ten days i agreed to go back down in the government but that is a long story you don't want to hear the details of getting my wife well and getting a house and all that stuff
one thing that i inherited right off the bat was the manned orbital laboratory
and even then it was clearly in some jeopardy
when programs start getting a ceiling built in where they say we're going to keep it going but it is going to be kept going at a level of and i forget what the level was for mol something like dollars five hundred million or something like that
because any large program over time there is always opposition to it and there is more time for it to be shot down and ultimately eliminated
i realize that it was in deep trouble when i was over in the bureau of the budget talking to a junior member of the bureau of the budget and he said i hope you realize that the shuttle is in deep trouble from a standpoint of support here in the white house
and so i went back to mel laird and said look one thing i want to do is to have one shot with the president to be sure he fully understands what the capability of the mol will be
it was far along
lots of expense had gone into it including major facility construction out of vandenberg
i had my day in court
it was a sunny afternoon
i got general stewart who was very involved in the mol to join me and mel laird
and we went over there
it was just kissinger and the president
and i had a few simple minded charts that showed what we were going to do from a resolution standpoint if we kept going with the mol and what that would mean in terms of understanding more clearly what was going on in a given situation
i had my half hour in court
i could see a band outside getting ready to play so i knew that the president was about to be rushed out for some kind of a ceremony
that was a saturday
monday morning i got a call from kissinger
and he said bob and i cannot really imitate his german accent that was a very very fine presentation
and a day later i found out that mol was cancelled
that was with president nixon
he sat there the whole time
he had a yellow foolscap and took prodigious notes of everything i was saying which was sort of nerve racking the president of the united states bothering with what i am saying
anyway that was sort of where i came from from the mol
the next step along the way was after apollo what was going to happen in space
there were to be eight launches of the apollo lunar program
nixon cut that back to two sort of arbitrarily
and there were no plans for using those assets
jim webb was my boss in nasa
and i used to see him
he was very very ill the latter part of his life
and i would drop by
and he would ask me strange questions like what do you plan to do with your life before you kick the bucket kind of questions like that
and he said i haven't got long to live
and i would say you're doing fine jim
and i am just going to work along and see what i can do to help out here and there
anyway his big thrust was we felt we were building a major capability for the country and now it is all being washed away
and what is going to replace it
the shuttle came up as an option
actually to say on the surface it makes an awful lot of sense to recover something
we could easily visualize a transportation system for the country where every time a seven hundred forty seven went across the country with a payload everybody jumped out and then you threw it in the ocean
it didn't seem to make much sense
you just knew it had to be more efficient to reuse something
although with gemini we had looked into that possibility
we were recovering the gemini's why didn't we use them again
and we found that we are going to have to put probably seventy five percents of the original cost into reactivating the gemini's
so actually i had a hunch that it wasn't going to be quite as simple as landing an airplane and then taking off again
the air force was going to be one of the prime users of the shuttle
and the question was how large did the bomb bay not the bomb bay
how large did the experimental bay have to be for the missions that were going to be carried out
there was no thought let me just quickly say of putting armament aboard the shuttle
i misspoke
and then one of the questions was how rapidly did you have to recover it if something happened and you wanted to bring something back in a hurry
and to bring it back you had to make up a co planer change and that was going to take a certain amount of energy to put it mildly
anyway those are many of the issues
and i think as i remember it my friends in nasa thought the air force was being pretty tough on them
but if we were going to accept the use of a vehicle in all seriousness as you've just heard it had to have ability to carry out the missions
and so that was sort of the next step along the way
and then after i got through in the government i ended up some years later out at aerospace and ended up as the chairman of the corporation
and they worked closely with that element in the air force that was so much involved in these type programs that you've just been hearing about
and we were beginning to go into shock at least those in the nucleus who were sort of running the aerospace
and myself
more and more it appeared that we were going to not be allowed to put anything in space except through the shuttle
and that seemed to be imminently wrong
to think that you're going to have to risk the life of astronauts every time you wanted to put any kind of a satellite in orbit
from the standpoint of a paperclip individual who is looking at cost to just have the one vehicle and use it and use it and use it and thereby supposedly cutting the cost had a lot of charm
and it reached the point where he and i decided we had to try to do something about it
and we made an appointment with the then secretary of the air force and said you've just going to be stashing away titan somewhere so that if we run into trouble with the shuttle we are going to be able to move over and put these very important payloads into orbit
and then they had the challenger accident
at that point this i think major fallacy in policy was changed back where it should have been
you just shouldn't rely on a single vehicle
and that is my introduction
yes
you wanted reusability but some people also didn't want to risk the lives of astronauts
why not make a reusable unmanned vehicle
that's a very good question
why couldn't we do it
that might be a good design challenge for you guys here in this class to investigate that possibility
unmanned
we've gone partway in that direction by say recovering the shuttle casings obviously the shuttle itself
but trying to recover at least elements of the unmanned launch vehicles i'm not prepared to really give you a definitive answer on that
that's a good question and we will talk about it later
yes
before the shuttle concept was finalized and military requirements were finalized for the shuttle the military had been launching their satellites and their missions using titan's and atlas's correct
so why this requirement of the shuttle having to be able to bring back a satellite using really a military satellite when that wasn't being done or required beforehand
like why was that created
what was so special about it
we worked very hard on proposals to bring back satellites that were out of fuel or needed refurbishment but when i was referring to landing with the shuttle with payloads in the bay that is for a failed mission
and for some reason the payload could not get ejected
you still had to be able to land back what was now a very heavy spacecraft and glide on it and land safely
that turns out to be a really hard thing to do especially if you're carrying solids and liquids onboard that were close to being ready to ignite so to speak
but there is talk of retrieving satellites
and as you know nasa did bring back some small satellites the palapa one from hughes
and also did a lot of very innovative repairs in space
but when we looked at it from a customer point of view it turns out there is a lot that wears out in satellites not just using a propellant
but the processors degrade due to radiation solar panels degrade just due to micro dust and things like that
and so bringing back a satellite for reuse was never felt at the time we looked at it to be a worthwhile thing to do
and that ties in directly with what i was saying about recovering a gemini
and of course on top of that with a gemini is the fact you are landing them in the water so they got a good dousing of salt
and so the degradation of the gemini's were such that we just didn't think it made any sense to try to refurbish them
yes
the military was only really looking to capture and service in space then release not necessarily capture and bring back
they never seriously went after the capture and refurbish and release
they really went after launch and deployment
but i would say that in that theme the most successful story actually of refurbishment is the hubble space telescope
and not for the reasons that you think of
when you think about stories of the hubble space telescope you hear about jeff hoffman going up there and changing processors and fixing the optics
also on those missions they replaced solar panels that were causing huge problems due to thermal warpage and shrinkage and what they call oil canning due to thermal stresses
and so the replacement of those solar panels which turned out to be not very good as initially designed is one of the really true success stories of man in space
and there is actually a very nice video which maybe you have seen of the lady astronaut who did the replacement of the solar panels on hubble pushing out and releasing the solar panels
things fly away in the sunshine looking like giant butterfly wings reflecting all the colors and then finally fall into the atmosphere
it is almost poetic i tell you
it's amazing
on the hubble one of the considerations right from the beginning was that it should be a serviceable satellite
it was designed so that you could get inside of it relatively easily and so on
frankly i don't know of any other satellite that was really designed quite that way
maybe i'm wrong
i believe you're right
yes
on the solar panel it wasn't designed to replace the panel
but you can go back to skylab which was the next to last launching of the apollo
on that one i guess we decided to take what was the third stage of a saturn and just gut it not have any propulsion in it and fit it out to be a spacecraft namely a space station
and when they got up there the solar panels got fouled up
and one of the real tricks when the astronauts first got to it because it was not launched manned was to unravel some wires that got caught on it so actually the panels could spread out and it could start to operate again
colonial siemens i don't know if either of you would know but what are the duties involved in like the heavy payload aspect of the new cev project
delta four going out of vandenberg was carrying classified payload
it's not a dummy either
it is real
they have standing requirements for these types of things
the national needs go on
the international stage as we know is filled with new actors and new threats
we have what is called unsymmetrical warfare things that are hard to counter by conventional means
back in the seventy s and eighty s we had symmetrical warfare submarines versus submarines missiles versus missiles
now as we know it is much harder much tougher but the needs are still there
but is the collaboration between nasa and the military still pretty active
it is not in terms of payloads
it is there in exchange of technologies things like development of more efficient sensors processors that sort of thing
it is everybody's benefit for example to have more powerful faster rad hard space processors
everybody wins in that type of situation
back to your question on reusability
you will notice that one of the real strong pluses or the calling cards of the space shuttle program was the fact that it was a reusable launch vehicle
in this current environment of the cevs and new launch vehicles what do you hear today about reusable launch vehicles
nothing
isn't it amazing how things have changed just in a matter of twenty five years
one thing i just sort of forgot to mention with regard to the manned orbital laboratory
it was thought at that time that by having men there and their ability to inspect a fairly wide swath that they would have time in flying over that swath to do some searching
and could do a better job of detecting possible items of tremendous interest from a military standpoint than trying to do it all automatically
and of course what finally washed out that argument was the ability to have satellites that had almost instantaneous transmission of information back home
what was the design for the mol for crew transportation
they were going to take off on a titan they were going to aboard a gemini and they were going to have a laboratory of sorts which would have the necessary reconnaissance and other equipment aboard
so it was similar to skylab in that you had a non reusable capsule as the crew transfer
it had a gemini type return vehicle but it was definitely going to be very small and cramped compared to shuttle
there was no thought of having another gemini come up and make use of it
yes
why did gemini apollo and mercury all land on water because that is very expensive and the russians landed on land
well very simple
if you take a look at where the launch sites were for the soviets if they aborted they had to have the capability of coming down on land any kind of abort mission
similarly operating out of the cape canaveral area if you abort you have to come down on the water
the question was then was it worthwhile to have the capability of doing both
well that just added weight
and so we stuck with the water and they stuck with the land
do any of the new defense payloads require human intervention in their deployment or are they all completely
they are all titan iv eelv compatible
anything else
i think we wore everybody out
well you know bob and i will stick around but we're not going to hold you down here if there are no questions
i guess we will call the class
and we will stick around if anybody wants to ask any more detailed questions or have follow ups
my phone number and email is up there
i will be glad to talk to any of you one on one about any of this
there is quite a lot more detail we can provide either bob or myself
and if i have to i will write bob a note asking for further information
ok
well thanks a lot
let's see
the original schedule today had colonel gordon fullerton going to come and talk to us about both cockpit design but primarily about test flying the shuttle
unfortunately he is in charge of flight operations
well not unfortunately
he is in charge of flight operations at dryden flight research center for nasa
unfortunately for us since the time that we had agreed on this date they scheduled at the beginning of next week a major base inspection
and if any of you are connected with the military you know what that involves
and since he is head of flight operations he really has to be there to make sure that they are ready for it
he has rescheduled
he will be here in november
and i will make adjustments to the syllabus
on thursday bob ried is going to talk about aerothermodynamics
and what i thought i would do today is kind of a potpourri maybe doing a little bit of recap on where we've gotten to so far
and also i brought a few videos just to give you a visual reminder of some of the things that we've been talking about with the shuttle
any sort of general questions about what i handed back to you
i am happy to meet with teams individually to discuss any specific questions
ok
let's see
one thing that i hi
i was just telling the class gordon fullerton was supposed to be here but he has had to postpone to november because they're having a base inspection of flight operations
so he is not here
i had an email from professor cohen who will be here
and let's see if this is he had an idea that now that we've kind of started going into details on various subsystems that it might be interesting to work our way through a shuttle flight and just remind ourselves of the different subsystems that are brought into play at various times during a shuttle mission
this is kind of part of the systems integration process
and remember that we talked at the beginning how in the systems engineering process we always want to keep in mind the eventual operational use of the systems that are being designed
so the idea for instance would be start at the very beginning
you're sitting on the pad
you could even go further than that because remember we talked about how systems had to be developed for instance for loading the payload into the cargo bay
they have that big payload changeout room
they had to design the hypergolic reaction control and oms motors in such a way that the pods were actually removable from the shuttle because they were using hazardous hypergolic fuel and they cannot be serviced in the main hanger
they have to be taken over to a remote section of the kennedy space center
and then of course the servicing of the tiles
there is a lot of servicing and maintenance work that has to be done on all the subsystems
and ideally it should be designed in from the beginning
of course in many cases we got a lot smarter after we started to use the shuttle
and if we were doing it again which is something that you will be thinking about we would
in fact have built certain things into the subsystems which would have made it easier for them to be maintained and repaired
what i am going to do just as an experiment here let's think briefly about these subsystems
and i've got a little video taking us through the launch and the entry stages
and then i have one or two other things to show you which will just illustrate certain other aspects of the shuttle mission
right at the moment of liftoff just kind of to set the stage the final countdown starts at t minus nine minutes
they typically will have holds built into the count so that particularly when you're going for a very tight launch window like if you're on a rendezvous mission to the space station you have to launch when the space station basically is pretty much going overhead
and since the space station is in a fifty one degree orbit it takes more energy to get into a fifty one degree orbit
because normally if you launch from cape canaveral hopefully you understand the orbital dynamics if you launch due east you get the full speed of the earth's rotation
and since the latitude of cape canaveral is twenty eight degrees that puts you into an orbit which is inclined twenty eight degrees to the equator
that is what we did when we did a rendezvous with the hubble telescope which is in twenty eight degrees
in fact i remember my brother was telling me that we launched about four point zero am so it was night
and just about twenty minutes before we launched they saw hubble fly over and everybody thought that is a good sign they seem to know what they are doing
the thing is that when you have an object that is in orbit and the orbit you can think of as being roughly fixed in inertial space obviously it precesses a few degrees every day
but if you think of it as fixed in inertial space on the time scale of a day or so then the earth is turning underneath it
and you have to launch basically when you are in that orbital plane
now if you have a little bit of extra energy to burn you can launch a little bit earlier or a little bit later and use that extra delta v to change your velocity to get into that plane
if you're launching to rendezvous with hubble say which is in a twenty eight degree orbit you have a bigger launch window than you do if you launch into the space station at a fifty one degree orbit
because going into a fifty one degree orbit you are using a lot of extra delta v just to change from a twenty eight to a fifty one degree inclination
so the launch window to rendezvous with the space station is very short
it is only about five minutes
so in order to make sure that they have the maximum chance of making the launch window they actually build in some extra large holes even more so than for a normal launch
but you pick up the final count at nine minutes
the shuttle at that point is on external power
at about seven minutes the pilot that is the person sitting on the right hand side who should be called the copilot and i've talked about this with a few of you
none of the astronaut test pilots you know these are kind of big ego people
nobody wants to be called a copilot
the person sitting in the right seat is the pilot
the person sitting in the left seat who is really the pilot is called the commander
the pilot does not fly the shuttle except for usually if you have a nice commander he will let the pilot when you're pulling away from the space station it is kind of a tradition that you give the pilot the stick and let the pilot do a fly around
and in the old days some of the commanders actually gave the pilots a little bit of stick time before landing
but that generally doesn't happen now
anyway the pilot is in charge of a lot of the subsystems the main engines the electrical power system the auxiliary power units
it is the pilot who has to throw a switch to put the shuttle on internal power
at about eight minutes before a launch you go onto fuel cell power
then at about five point five minutes before a launch you turn on the auxiliary power unit
remember we talked about that subsystem
that generates the hydraulic pressure to move the flight control surfaces and the main engine bells
and you will see if you watch a launch sequence starting at about three minutes after the auxiliary power unit comes on at that point you can sort of feel a little bit of humming in the vehicle when you're sitting in it they then move the engine bells back and forth through their entire range just to make sure that the hydraulics are working
and actually the whole shuttle shakes when that happens so you can sort of feel that when you're sitting there
and then of course one of the challenges with a cryogenic engine and this going to be an interesting development project for the future when they want to have a restartable engine
remember these are cryogenic engines and so you have to do a cool down
and so you start to flow the liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen through the piping
again inside a minute you can feel kind of a rumbling down below as valves are opening and things are starting to flow
at thirty one seconds the launch control center gives control over to the shuttle computers
and the last thirty one seconds are controlled entirely by the shuttle computers
they look at thousands of data points to make sure that everything is working properly
at t minus six seconds the engines go through an ignite sequence
the engine starts are staggered
and you will see that when you look at the slow motion of the video that i am going to show you
that reduces the shock on the system
it only takes a couple of seconds for the engines to come up to full power
you certainly don't want to commit yourself to lighting the solid boosters unless you are one hundred percents sure that your main engines are firing
because if even one main engine is not operating at one hundred percents efficiency you cannot make it to orbit
in fact if you have one engine out on the pad you have to do a return to launch site abort
we will talk about the details of that whole process at some point
audience question you can abort launch right up to when the solid once the boosters are lit you are going
just hope you're pointed in the right direction because there is no thrust termination on the solids
and it has happened four times that we have had pad shutdowns
the engines are monitored
on two of those occasions it turned out that the problems were instrumentation
on two occasions it turned out that there were in fact real engine problems
and i would say for a fifty percents success rate you're doing well
i mean it was the right thing to shut down the engines all those times
although the very first time when they had an engine shutdown on the pad well first of all just an acronym is meco main engine cutoff which normally happens about eight point five minutes after launch
the comment by steve hawley who was the flight engineer in the center seat when they had this was on the fourteenth shuttle flight when they had a pad abort his comment was somehow i thought we would be a little bit higher at meco and it turned out they didn't realize it at the time but they actually had a hydrogen fire on the pad
remember we talked about how there was a lot of hydrogen
and of course before the engine ignition we have those sparklers to get rid of the excess hydrogen
but in the process of shutting down the engines there was also a lot of excess hydrogen which got into the engine
and the problem is that a hydrogen fire as you know is pretty much invisible
and they didn't have any infrared cameras at the time
and so basically everybody went around the crew took their time and everybody went out
once they realized it they put on a water douse
now we have infrared cameras
and whenever you have an engine shutdown you have to be very careful that you don't in fact have a hydrogen fire
coming back to the subsystem the last stage of the launch the main engines have gone on
you have turned on the hydraulic system both for the main engine and the boosters have their own hydraulic systems and the boosters have their own auxiliary power unit
guidance navigation and control of course is absolutely critical
now first stage is what they call basically open loop guidance
there is a specific projectory that you are supposed to follow
once the solid boosters are off you are following a closed loop guidance which is taking you to a specific point and velocity in time and space and the trajectory is actively adjusted to get there
because the solid boosters have so much thrust you don't want to do a lot of sporty maneuvering
in fact the biggest challenge from a maneuvering point of view is when you're going through max q and maximum dynamic pressure and you have to relieve wind shear loads on the aero surfaces
basically when the boosters are firing from the crew's point of view it is hands off
there is now way that you could take manual control over the boosters
there is just too much power
and just a little bit of deviation from your course and you will break up aerodynamically
it is hands off
the fuel cells are generating all of the power
the guidance navigation and control is being done inside the shuttle and the results are sent to the solid boosters
the gimbals can move
so the roll maneuver for instance is done by the solid engines
how do the solids gimbal
the solids can gimbal yeah
how do they gimbal
the same way as the main engines
i mean they are on a mounting with hydraulic actuators
and so the actuators expand and contract
and you can imagine the forces that are involved there because these are two point five million pound thrust engines
it is pretty amazing
going through maximum dynamic pressure srb separation main engine cutoff basically the same systems are working
the critical things are of course the main engine has to be throttleable
this was a big challenge as we heard in making the main engine
it is throttleable for two reasons
going through a maximum dynamic pressure
and at that point the solids are also you know the way the solid propellant is loaded the actual cross sectional profile is such that you don't have a constant thrust profile
the thrust profile is very high right at liftoff where you need a lot of thrust
it falls off as you're going through maximum dynamic pressure
and then it builds up as you burn through the last two minutes of srb firing
the shuttle is pulling about two point five gs at srb cutoff
the aerodynamic separation of the solids got a lot of attention
to have a re contact would be a disaster so you have four separation motors two at the top and two at the bottom which basically push the solid boosters away from the shuttle
and of course those motors are pointed right at the shuttle in order to move the boosters away
it is pretty spectacular when you're inside especially at night
they are little solid rocket motors and they are firing right at you so visually it's spectacular
but it also unfortunately leaves kind of a nasty coating on the front windshield most of which luckily gets burned off during reentry
but the pilots were a little bit concerned that that might hurt their visibility in landing particularly if you had a bad sun angle
they always try to consider the sun angle for landing as well as winds
after srbs come off now you're back to about one g
you have second stage guidance which is closed loop
you're sensing acceleration and orientation
nowadays they often fire the oms engines for part of liftoff as well just to get a little extra oomph when they're going up to the space station so that's another system which is brought into play during ascent
then you get into after meco eight point five eight point seventy five minutes
now you have to get rid of the external tank and you've got a lot to do basically to power down the main engines
remember you have been burning liquid oxygen liquid hydrogen
you've got a tremendous amount of ice which forms in the engine
i have some pictures to show you of what that looks like when you get into orbit
also you've got thousands of pounds of hydrogen and oxygen left inside the pipes
and if you just close your valves eventually that will all vaporize build up pressure and actually could cause an explosion
one of the first things that you have to do when you get into orbit is to vent the main propulsion system
let's see
actually professor cohen did not put on rcs here which is absolutely critical because you have explosive bolts to separate you from the external tank
but basically the external tank has no propulsion on its own so you on the shuttle have to fly away from it
so you use your plus z
that is the downward thrusters
remember we talked about how the shuttle has two rcs systems
it has the primary systems which have about eight hundred fifty pounds of thrust for each thruster
and then once you're in orbit and you don't have to do a lot of propulsive maneuvering then we shut down the primaries and we use the verniers which only have twenty five pounds
that takes a lot less fuel
but those primary thrusters we use not only the ones in the aft but in the forward so that you have balanced thrust
if you're trying to move away from the external tank you want to fire the thrusters both in the nose and in the tail so that you move straight up
well we're sitting up in the nose
and when those thrusters go off i mean i've never been in a war or a battle but it strikes me that the sound is what you would get if mortar shells were exploding around you
i mean it is just a boom
and right after riding through launch the first thing that happens is you go weightless
but then the next thing is you're hearing these explosions all around you
and it can be quite exciting
actually i will just share a story with you
on my first flight they decided to do a special kind of a test
there are fill and drain valves for the main engine on the side of the shuttle
usually we vent the propulsion out through the engines themselves but they wanted to look for a quicker way to do it
let's see
this was the sixteenth shuttle flight which was my first flight and they gave us what they call a detailed test objective where right after external tank separation we opened the side fill and drain valve
and i remember the commander asked some of the guidance and control people is the shuttle rcs going to be able to compensate for the extra thrust that you get
they said yeah no problem we've done the calculations and it looks fine
and this is the reason why you do tests because in fact what happened was we came off the tank opened the fill and drain valve and the shuttle rolled over ninety degrees and the rcs jets started going like crazy to try to correct us
they were in a force fight
after about fifteen seconds the pilot said to the commander do you think i should shut the valve because the noise was incredible
like i say it was like you were in the middle of a battlefield
and at that point the commander said well it's too late now because we had gotten through most of the disturbance
and we did recover and got to normal attitude but it was pretty exciting
the point is that at that point you are in a transitional state
your computers are still in the launch configuration
you have your primary rcs
and what you have to do is transform the shuttle now into an on orbit configuration
the shuttle computers are so ancient
has anyone here ever never mind used an overlay technique but even heard of computer overlays
no i didn't think so
back in the old days when computers had rather small memory and you had to run large programs
what you would do is you would have your entire program well originally it was on punch cards and then eventually on magnetic tape
but you would segment your program and then you would load the first part of your program as much as you could fit into memory
run that save the results load the second part transfer the results run on that and so on
well believe it or not that's the way the shuttle computers still operate
it is an overlay system
they cannot hold all the software for the entire flight so we have a launch overlay an ascent an on orbit and an entry
now the backup flight system is stripped down
and so the backup computers hold the software for the entire mission but there are a lot of things that they don't do that the main computers do
what you actually have to do is perform what they call a major mode transition which basically means you punch a few buttons tell the computers to go into orbit mode and then all the screens go blank
i mean it is a very kind of a strange feeling
and you just have to sort of hold your hands and not touch anything for about a minute or so while the tape recorders are spinning down in the guts of the shuttle and they're loading the stuff onto the shuttle computers
now i think they upgraded the tape recorders to solid state i believe
that's correct isn't it
do you know that
i don't think they use tape recorders in the shuttle anymore but they did in any case at the beginning
i mean just maintaining this computer system has been a big challenge
and then you get into the orbit configuration
in the ascent configuration your vernier rcs isn't even enabled
and inside the ascent configuration of course you have not just your nominal ascent but you have all of the launch abort modes or return to launch site transatlantic abort and abort to orbit or abort once around
all that gets flushed and now you are on orbit
your on orbit software does not give you the ability to do entry and landing
you are going to have to re do another overlay or what we call major mode transition before you do that
yeah
there are several different landings spots right
right
there is always one picked as a prime but you have the ability to re designate depending on where in the ascent you run into a problem
all options are available but there always is a prime transatlantic abort site which is chosen
and usually what happens is i mean there are several transatlantic launch sites sometimes one or more of them is down because of weather
and in fact if all of them are down even if the weather is perfect in florida you scrub because you need to have an abort site
ok
i am going to show you a video now
ok
i will try to walk you through some of these
remember that is the water deluge to stop the shockwave coming back
now you have the stage combustion
these are the oms engines the rcs and the main engines
remember we talked about the off angle thrust
those are the bolts which hold the solid boosters down
all eight of them have to fire at exactly the moment of srb ignition
if you watch closely when you see it go up you can actually see it sort of moving that way again because of the off angle thrust of the main engine
this is the roll maneuver which puts you you go over on your back headed towards the proper orbit
and then as you go through max dynamic pressure and break mach one you often get those condensation trails
this is a pilot's eye view now of a shuttle launch
this is speeded up by a factor of two
that was the roll maneuver and the florida coastline
and i always thought one of the amazing things was actually how fast the blue sky turns black as you are going up
srb separation you're up at an altitude of about twenty miles
and you can see up there that very quickly the blue sky of earth is turning into the black of space
this launch was a high inclination launch so they were actually going into a fifty eight degree orbit so they flew literally right up the eastern seaboard
audience question it was a spacelab mission i believe and one of the things they were going to do was observe the earth so they wanted to get into as high an inclination as possible
remember when bass redd was talking about the aerodynamics of the shuttle he said that one of the things that they never were able to get quite right was the plume
and he talked a lot about the angle of the skirt and how that affects the aerodynamics of the plume
and you can watch how the plume is continually changing as you are getting higher in the atmosphere and you have less and less pressure
you also notice some of the flames are getting sucked back
in between the shuttle and the external tank of course that is where we had the problems with the foam shutoff you've got supersonic shockwaves bouncing around
it is a very very nasty environment in there
and you see when the external tank comes off often there is a lot of area here which is charred and burned out just because of the shocks
you can see now that the plumes are tremendously expanded
the other thing that you can well i will wait until srb separation
as i say you are up to about two point five gs at this point and now you can see that the solids are starting to tail off
you can see a qualitative difference in the flame pattern
and now you can definitely feel this inside
you see the separation motors
the boosters fall off
and as you know they were recovered
making sure that the thrust tail off matches as we heard was critical
now here is a picture from a belly camera of the boosters falling off
now the main engines are firing
when this happens i don't know if you have seen pictures of saturn launches
they actually have some of the most beautiful patterns of the reentering plumes
but the plumes as you get up into a vacuum the exhaust plume expands
and it actually folds back around the vehicle which is not a danger to the vehicle but visually can be quite spectacular
on the first night launch of the shuttle during the day the plume is so faint that you really cannot see it from outside the windows
from the ground you can see the bright points when you're looking right at the tail of the shuttle but you don't actually see the plumes
but the second flight engineer who has a good view out the overhead window about five minutes into launch he asked the pilot who is in charge of looking after the main propulsion system is everything ok with the engines
yeah everything is ok
in about six minutes everything ok with the engines
yeah
and after they were on orbit the pilot asked him why did you keep asking me about the engines
everything was fine
well apparently the guy had been looking out the overhead window and had seen flames starting to come out which is essentially the expanding plume
of course it was the first night launch so nobody had ever seen that on the shuttle before
and so you're always looking for something off nominal
but as it turned out it is just normal plume behavior
now we've got a few minutes riding on the main engine to build up to orbital velocity
essentially we are flying up the eastern seaboard
and it will give you some sense of the acceleration
hopefully you will recognize some of the geography
when they talk about taking the shuttle from washington to boston or back this is the real thing
it takes about eight minutes eight point five minutes to get from cape canaveral to cape cod
there is long island coming up
i heard plattsburgh new york was an alternate landing site
yeah
we are really moving at this point
you're going about five miles a second orbital velocity
there is cape cod
and now you will see a little bit of a pitch as we separate from the tank
and here again is the belly camera as the tank comes off
and you can see these little charred patterns in here
that is where the big piece of foam came off which destroyed the columbia
we've talked about for its orbital operation it was all the different things that the shuttle was supposed to do that really drove the design
speaking of which how did things go last thursday
colonel young gave the lecture on the military
i haven't had a chance to talk with him yet but hopefully maybe he had some new insights
i know we talked a lot already about military requirements
but in addition to launching large satellites of course we have repaired satellites we have done science experiments we have done a lot of educational activities
and i am not going to deal with those subsystems so much now
remember that the computers now really don't deal with the main propulsion system anymore
the only thing that you have to be concerned about generally in orbit you still have to maintain thermal control over all of the parts of the shuttle so the thermal subsystem is very critical
we talked about the problems with hydrazine
if hydrazine freezes and then it expands when it thaws it can break the lines
hydrazine leaks are very nasty
we had one instance on a shuttle flight where one of the thrusters did develop a leak and you could just see the exhaust coming out of it until they shut off the isolation valve
there are several sets of rcs thrusters each of which is connected to the tanks by a set of isolation valves
you have essentially triple redundancy in your reaction control system
and if any one of the systems develops a leak you can isolate individual thrusters to tell them not to fire if it's a leak which only occurs when you fire it or you can shut down an isolation valve for an entire set of jets
i won't go into great details but we talked about the importance of redundancy
and that is one of the ways that it is built in
let's see
what else do we want to say about subsystems during orbit
what are some of the other subsystems which get called into play for orbital operations
environmental subsystems
environmental
is that controlled by the computer or is that kind of done separate and automated
a little bit of both
for instance pressure valves are mechanical so they will open at a specific pressure mechanically
if you have an overpressure or you set your we have different settings
the normal setting is for sea zero point forty three twenty point five hundred twenty six level atmosphere
and of course you have to balance the oxygen and the nitrogen
and so there is a fairly complex algorithm
well it is fairly simple i suppose
but there is an algorithm which senses both the overall pressure and the oxygen partial pressure so that if your pressure goes down a little bit the system has to know whether to open up the oxygen valve or the nitrogen valve
also if we are going to be doing extended space walks and i will be giving a talk on the airlock and the spacesuit and the other systems that get involved in space walks so i won't go into that in detail here but we actually have to bring the cabin down to two thirds of an atmosphere ten point two pounds per square inch
we keep the partial pressure of oxygen at sea level so that raises the oxygen concentration to about thirty percents
and the reason we do that is to purge the nitrogen out of our bodies so that you don't get the bends when you go down to the four psi at pure oxygen which is what we run our suits at
at that point we actually have to trick the system because they didn't build in a ten point two controller
they have a fourteen point seven psi controller
but in any case that we control manually
and we basically bring the cabin down to ten point two psi
humidity control we have the water system
of course we make a lot of water with our fuel cells for the electrical power system
there are five different water tanks
one of the tanks is sterilized for drinking
in the early days they put too much iodine in the water
in fact when i came back from my first flight my teeth were totally brown
the dentist had a fit and they actually have cut back on that
and the water is actually reasonably palatable at this point
you couldn't drink it early on unless you mixed it with kool aid or tang or something which is even worse but that's another story
the rest of the water tanks there is just a lot more water than anybody can drink and so those are called supply water tanks
and we use that water for cooling
remember that is another part of the environmental control system
we have talked about all of these a little bit
this is just kind of a review
remember that during ascent once you get above one hundred thousand feet and during the early time on orbit we get rid of excess heat by water boiler
now it is an interesting system a multi component system
out in the cargo bay we use freon to bring the heat through the radiators
first it goes through the radiators and so once the payload bay doors are open particularly if you're pointed away from the sun you can radiate a lot of heat
after the freon runs through the radiators if it is still hot you can activate the water boilers
and so if the payload bay doors are closed or if there is some problem with the radiators and you need excess cooling capacity you activate the water spray boilers
now the water boilers if that is your only cooling system they use water at a rate faster than the fuel cells produce it
if you cannot get your payload bay doors open and that is part of the whole mechanisms
remember which henry pohl talked about if you cannot get your payload doors open within a few hours you have to turn around and come home because you will run out of water
now on the other hand how do you get the heat out of the crew cabin
you don't want freon running around the crew cabin because it is nasty stuff if you develop a leak
there are actually two ways
first of all you circulate the cabin air which gets heated up both by the people and the electronics
and you run the cabin air through a heat exchanger where it dumps its heat into a cold water loop
and the cold water loop takes cabin heat and then the cold water loop is also circulated by some of the electronics
some of the electronics are air cooled
and of course there is no density driven thermal convection in weightlessness
you have to have forced air convection so there are fans all over the place blowing air at the electronics and at the crew as well
and these are all small fans running at very high rpm and so they tend to be very noisy
in fact the typical environment in a space cabin is dominated by high pitched fan noise
in fact it gets so bad that in the russian mir we found this once us astronauts starting to fly up there it was actually causing permanent hearing damage in a lot of crew members
and people were having to wear earplugs or headphones while they were working near some of the equipment
from a human factors point of view to have earplugs in and then somebody tries to call to you from the next module because there is an emergency that is not a good deal
yeah
no
there are a lot of electrical signals up there because the crew uses wireless headsets but everything is checked for electromagnetic compatibility
and in fact if you try to fly a payload on the shuttle or the station you have to pass a lot of emc compatibility testing
anyway the water from the cabin which is taking the heat both from the air and the electronics is then taken out of the cabin and passed through a water freon heat exchanger
and then the freon takes the heat further aft where it is dumped into the radiator or the water spray boiler
cabin air revitalization
we re breathe the air
it's not like in scuba diving where you take a breath of air and then you just blow it all away
we cannot afford that so the air is re breathed which means you have to scrub out the carbon dioxide
the shuttle is not designed for long duration and so we use lithium hydroxide scrubbers lithium hydroxide plus carbon dioxide makes lithium carbonate plus water plus heat
and so those are canisters which have to be replaced twice a day
and in fact the preparation for replacing the lithium hydroxide scrubbers is you have to turn the cabin fans off so you don't get a lot of air going through the cylinders where you put the scrubbers
for that one minute you can actually appreciate the peace and quiet of being in orbit
and then you turn the fans on again and you realize how noisy it is
because after a while you get used to it and you don't hear the noise until you turn it off
so that's air revitalization system
humidity separation
you're pumping out a lot of humidity in your sweat and that is put through a cooler and essentially a centrifugal they call it a slinger which gets rid of the water
and that goes into the wastewater tank along with urine from the waste collection system
and that is also dumped overboard
there are separate dumps for the supply water and the waste water
and when the water is dumped overboard of course up in orbit the pressure is below the triple point of water so liquid water cannot exist
you either have gaseous water vapor or ice
and so as soon as the water comes out the wastewater dump valve it solidifies
and you get essentially a snowstorm blowing away from you
and if the sun is lighting it up in just the right way it can be quite spectacular
if i have time i will show you a picture of that
let's see
other on orbit systems
of course we have the payload systems
we talked about the remote manipulator the robotic arm
anything else
the crew uses lots of checklists and cue cards
typically the center of the front cockpit has mostly the airplane type controls which you use for flying the shuttle
the systems controls tend to be around the sides
and then the controls for doing rendezvous and operating payloads are in the aft part of the cockpit
the forward center cockpit is not used very much when you're on orbit
overhead panels is mostly oms and rcs
and then electrical stuff is over the right
and environmental control is over on the left
yes
during the early phases of the rendezvous when you cannot see anything typically the commander and the pilot will sit in the front seats
but once you get close enough to have visual contact you typically don't approach straight on you typically approach with your payload bay pointing towards the object you're rendezvousing with
that way the rendezvous radar can pick it up
there is a rendezvous radar system ku band radar which is on the starboard side
and there are also star trackers which can pick it up when it is farther away
and then visually you just look out the overhead windows
and so you control the final phases of the rendezvous which we call proximity operations from the aft flight deck
and there is a controller stick there
and actually it is interesting
this is part of the human factors
both for controlling the manipulator arm and the shuttle there is a switch
for instance there is a translational hand controller and a rotational hand controller
the translational is to make the orbiter go in plus or minus x z or y
normally you think of the shuttle when you push the stick back you want the shuttle to go in the direction of the stick
and so that would be a plus or minus x which is along the long axis of the shuttle
and that is the way the forward controller works
and you can set the back controller up so that it is just the inverse of the forward controller so when you push on the stick the shuttle goes backwards
but when you are actually looking out the window and you see the object the space station or hubble or whatever you're rendezvousing with is ahead of you and you want to go towards it you would like to be able to push the stick
and so what they've done is here is the upper window they have the stick actually at an angle
depending on how you set the switch you can make it so that when you push on that stick it gives you a minus x or you can put it in the z mode so when you push the stick it gives you a minus z
and that is a nice human factor
they have a similar situation for the manipulator arm
on the end of the end effector when you're coming into a grapple fixture there are actually three wires inside the end effector
and those actually are moved around like so so that they tighten up over the little knob
but there is a camera up here
and then above the grapple fixture there is kind of a bull's eye with a little stick on it
the stick is like this
and if you're off to the side a little bit you can see by the angle on the stick both how you are in translation and in the attitude of the end effector
the thing is when you're actually flying the unintelligible and you're looking out the window i might want to be able to push the translational hand controller and the end effector will move away from me in the cargo bay
that is called a shuttle coordinate mode
and they have a nice setup
again this was from a lot of human factor studies
you can then go into a different mode when you're actually bringing the end effector right up to the docking fixture where you switch over into what they call end effector mode
now i am actually looking in the television picture and i see this image
and i want to correct it and i want to move to the side a little bit and go in but i want to do that in the frame of reference of the end effector
and so by going into end effector mode when i'm working the translational and rotational hand controller it actually works around that coordinate system
and there are actually two other coordinate systems for different types of payload operations
they have done a lot of work in these systems essentially to use computer assisted modes to make it easier to operate both the robotic and also the shuttle rendezvous and docking system
what else do we want to say about on orbit
that will probably do it
let's take a two minute break and then we will move ahead to entry
enough of a stretch
yeah
before we leave the on orbit part how much of the crews' time was taken up with changing the carbon dioxide scrubbers dumping wastewater just the general like you've got to do it to survive stuff versus
typically one person can take care of most of the on orbit just maintenance activities
you have to do things like periodically check your filters
every one or two days you have to go through with a vacuum cleaner and clear your filters
you have to change the lithium hydroxide
there you want somebody to help to turn off the cabin fans while the person downstairs is changing them out
periodically clean the toilet
prepare food
i would say more or less one person around the clock can take care of most of the things that have to get done if nothing goes wrong
you kind of alternate between crew members
yeah
typically you can have either a one shift or a two shift flight depending on whether your payload requires twenty four hour operations
and typically the pilot and the commander are considered to be the orbiter crew and so they will take care of orbiter related things
and other people concentrate more on the payload or doing space walks or whatever the mission is about
everybody is more or less trained to perform maintenance activities so you can share the load but typically with a crew of six or seven you have the luxury of specialization
let's see
i spoke at length about what goes on during entry so i am not going to go through all that again
i will just run the video here to remind you
but do remember again before you are ready to do your de orbit burn once again you have to reconfigure your computer system
again everybody gets in their seats hands off because you don't want to throw any switches
and you definitely don't want to touch the computer while it is going through this major mode reconfiguration
it is sort of like when your computer is booting up you don't want to mess with anything around
you just keep your hands off
once you are in the de orbit and entry major mode that is actually then subdivided into sub modes where one of the software loads controls your de orbit burn and then another one is in effect while you are essentially in free fall before you hit the atmosphere
and then once you hit the atmosphere you go through a series of sub modes depending on your altitude
and remember we spoke about how the flight control system continually has to upgrade its flight control laws depending on the atmospheric condition so you need to know your nav state
and then finally it switches into the final approach and landing mode when you go around the heading alignment circle
that is the final step which i don't think we talked about
remember i pointed out to you that since the shuttle is a glider that energy management is absolutely critical
and so you always come in with a little bit more energy than you are going to need because it is easier to bleed the energy off through a series of s turns
and then they make the transition when you're essentially mach two or mach three and you are over the landing field either in florida or in california
if this is your landing runway a regular airplane will typically do a downwind a base and then come in for a landing
with the shuttle we actually want a much larger pattern to give you more opportunity for energy control
at about fifty thousand feet the shuttle should be essentially overhead
and then it makes a big spiral
and since you're in this big spiral you have the option of either making the spiral slightly bigger or slightly smaller in order to control your energy
if you're a little bit too hot have too much energy then you make your spiral a little bit bigger
if you are a little low on energy you make your spiral smaller
but by having every landing end in this spiral which you can adjust the radius but the basic procedure and navigation is not going to change from flight to flight so that makes the whole training process much easier
you go into the so called heading alignment circle and the pilot does have energy displays available so you get predictors
it tells you where you will be thirty seconds one minute and ninety seconds in the future
you get a vertical display showing your energy a horizontal display
unfortunately and this is something for the people who are looking at displays the horizontal and the vertical displays are not well integrated
in the talk that some of you heard on the cockpit electronics upgrade they had some plans to upgrade that and have a unified landing display
but at the moment we don't have that
there is active guidance so that there are guidance needles which you can fly to
and of course the pilots are well enough trained that they are using their out the window cues as well to make sure that they get the right visual picture just in case something should be wrong with guidance
yeah
this is a ways back
how noticeable are the big changes in acceleration during like srb separation or de tail
srb separation as i said right before srb tail off f equals ma and the force is pretty much constant at that point but the mass is decelerating because you're burning a ton of fuel over a ton per second
so the acceleration is increasing
and you've built up to about two point five gs when the srbs finally tail off
then you drop down to about one g
you're sitting in your seat
this is one g into your chest
remember at this point the shuttle is kind of upside down
and since you haven't achieved orbital velocity yet you still have some weight pulling you out of the seat
but you are strapped into the seat
and mostly you feel yourself pulled back into the seat
and of course as your velocity increases and you get closer and closer to orbital velocity then the downward acceleration to the earth essentially matches more and more the acceleration of the shuttle itself until by the time you're in orbit you are in freefall
meco is different
the same thing happens
the main engines are working at maximum well one hundred four percents thrust
we don't take them up to the one hundred nine percents which is emergency only
they are working at one hundred four percents thrust and your acceleration now starts to pick up
after about seven minutes you've gotten up to three gs
and the shuttle was designed for a three g maximum
they wanted to have smooth easy right for the payloads
and they also wanted to make it possible for nonprofessional astronauts to fly on the shuttle as well the payload specialist scientists
the engines start to throttle down in order to hold your acceleration to three gs
and they throttle down eventually to about sixty five percents right at meco
so you are sitting in your seat pulling three gs eyeballs in for the last minute and a half or so three gs is not particularly comfortable but on the other hand any healthy person can tolerate three gs for a minute or two
it is not a real big deal
there have been concerns
if the pilots have to reach some of the overhead switches to reconfigure the oms or the rcs at three gs could they actually reach it
and some of the shorter pilots decided with the gs they probably couldn't
and so they actually made a special tool we called it a swizzle stick
it is an aluminum rod about i don't know eighty centimeters long that has an interface so you can actually use that
and you have a little mirror if you need it as well so that you can flick the overhead switches when you're pulling gs
you cannot ignore human factors in these things when you're designing it
if you've really got to flip those switches
and it is not just the problem of being able to reach it
it's also you have a helmet on
and when you're pulling three gs your helmet which may have weighed fifteen pounds now weighs forty five pounds
and so you really cannot move your head around very much
and so just being able to pull yourself away from the seat and look up you cannot do at three gs
so you do need some assistance there
in principle for future designs i would think taking advantage of the ability to send commands through computers would make a lot of that easier if your computer is within easy reach
this was the early days of fly by wire and people felt that they really wanted to have a hard switch that they could throw
but in fact in most cases not all but in most cases the switches go through the computer system
and it is possible in fact to go into the guts of the computer
and all the switches tend to be multiple pole
i am getting into some of the details now maybe more than ever wanted to know but just to give you an idea of the levels of redundancy that they have
every switch has multiple poles and it is possible that you can get a little solder ball or a little piece of wire or just one of the pole units that stops working
you can actually call up that switch on the computer and disable one or more of the poles or you can disable the entire switch and take over computer control of the switch
like i say most of the switches work like that
not all of them
but it is very much a computer controlled system
yeah
how does the acceleration compare to a de orbit burn
de orbit burn is interesting
when two oms engines fire they only produce about a tenth of g acceleration
however you have been weightless for a week a month six months depending what your mission has been
and i will tell you the shuttle is accelerating forward although you're actually going backwards
but internally the shuttle is accelerating forward so everything wants to go aft
and in fact it is kind of fun
we have done just experiments and taking pictures of it where you can actually pour water at a tenth of a g and watch the water slowly go through an arc into a cup
and then of course you've got to get it closed up before the burn stops
and you can take a little pencil and push it in the y axis and watch it gradually curve as you're accelerating
it is only a tenth of a g but i will tell you it feels like you're pressed against the wall if you're not sitting in your seat just because you haven't been experiencing any acceleration for all that time
and then it gets a lot worse as you hit the atmosphere
by that time hopefully you are sitting in your seat
it is kind of interesting
what i tended to like to do is keep a pencil sort of floating in front of me
and after a while you see very slowly the pencil is starting to come down
and then you would pick it up and then it is coming a little faster
one of the early things that you realize you know if you've seen pictures of people in orbit you're hands are always floating up here
the same thing as if you go into a swimming pool just hold your breath and float under water
your natural total relaxed body position is sort of bent over a little bit and your hands are out front
try it some time
it is quite relaxed quite comfortable
and it was a strange feeling
again i got used to it after my first entry
but the first time when i realized that i was sitting in my seat and my hands were actually in my lap and that hadn't happened
i had realized all the time before that your hands were sort of floating out there
and then i reached for the camera to take a picture out the window of the shockwaves behind the shuttle and all of a sudden it has got weight
it is amazing how the human mind can get used to a very bizarre situation you know like weightlessness such that when you get back it feels strange
it doesn't stay strange for long
i mean you grew up in one g and your body has a pretty good memory so it doesn't take long to get back
but there are potential vestibular problems
we have people in the manned vehicle lab who have spent their lifetimes studying some of these phenomena
a lot of your orientations for up or down come from your inner ear which have gravity receptors
well those basically don't work very well
they don't work at all because the little bone particles inside there are basically floating around
you don't get the proper feedback but you still get visual feedback and you get rotational feedback from your inner ear
and so your body has to essentially reprogram the feedback loops so that you can maintain your sense of orientation
and that leads to space sickness
and about roughly two thirds of people who go up experience some form of space sickness
it is sort of like seasickness
anywhere from mild the feeling ofweightlessness
but launch is really an overwhelming experience with all the vibration and the power and the acceleration and everything
and i remember thinking to myself at meco when i started floating i thought now i'm in an environment that i understand
because i had had so many one hundred thirty five parabolas that the feeling of being weightless was not as overwhelmingly new as it otherwise might have been
although what i realized after about a minute i was sort of holding onto the seat waiting for the pullout
that is when i realized no wait a minute no pullout you're really in orbit
and that is when i got really excited and sort of floated over to the window
and i basically couldn't wipe the smile off my face for about seven days
yeah
what about the internal clock
do you still have twenty four hour days
yeah basically
the sun rises and sets every ninety minutes
what we try to do this wasn't done in the early shuttle flights but often you have to launch at odd hours if you're doing a rendezvous particularly
for instance when we launched to repair hubble the launch was four point zero am because that's when hubble happened to be flying over
now four point zero am typically your body is at about its lowest point in the twenty four hour cycle
you know your basal metabolism your temperature
not the condition you want to be in when you go through a launch in case there is any problem
what you want to do is adjust your sleep cycle
it is very hard to adjust your sleep cycle when you have the sun rising and setting every ninety minutes because you don't get any light feedback but what we do is starting a week before a launch the crew goes into a medical quarantine so that you don't get exposed to any cold germs because you don't want to get sick on orbit
and so at that time what they have done is use some medical research over the last twenty years or so which indicates that bright lights at the right time of day can actually help your body change to a new time zone
that's why they say when you fly over to europe you fly overnight and you don't usually sleep too much in the airplane
you land early in the morning
and a lot of people then want to go to their hotel and go to sleep for a while but the doctors tell you that is the worst thing to do as far as getting used to the new time zone
what you really want to do is go stay out in the bright sunlight at a time when your body thinks it should be dark get the sunlight into your brain
and that is what we do
in the quarantine quarters everything is white
the tables have white butcher paper
and the walls and the ceiling are white
and there is essentially wall to wall fluorescent lights on the ceiling
and so it is really bright
i mean you have to wear sunglasses when you first go in the room
and it is too bright to watch television or even to use your computer but it works
and after about two days you are pretty much accommodated to the new time
and then if you want to go out during the day when the sun is out but it is a time when the sun shouldn't be out for the time you are trying to switch to you have to wear really really dark sunglasses so you don't get deprogrammed
the problem is sometimes when you're on orbit because of the procession of orbits you tend to have to re enter on a short shuttle flight this is different for the space station but on a short shuttle flight you typically reenter a few hours earlier than your equivalent launch time
and that means that you have to often do a sleep shift in orbit
and that is much more difficult particularly if you try to shift earlier
it is relatively easy to stay awake for an extra hour
i mean everybody likes to lie in bed for an extra hour
that is easy
but to go to bed an hour or two hours early it is hard to get to sleep
and then you have to wake up two hours early that is difficult
but that typically is what you have to do
the medical people have actually imposed maximum shifts both per day per week and per month for how much the crew can be asked to shift their sleep schedule
the russians have another problem when they do space walks because they don't have a full equivalent of a tdrs system tracking data relay system like we do
they like to be doing their space walks when they're making passes over russia so that they can get ground tracking
and so often when a russian crew is preparing for a space walk they have to shift sometimes by eight hours at a time
and it can be really tough on a crew to have to do that
if any of you have worked third shift
it's not like pulling an all nighter where the next day you go back onto your normal shift
to actually stay on a different shift for three or four days at a time can be tough when you don't have any light cues to accommodate you
yeah
just an observation that all those measures to shift the sleep cycle are obsolete now with the no night launches right
as long as there are no night launches that is probably true
and what that means of course is that they can only launch to the space station at certain times of the year
that is the price you pay
yeah
on the launch pad what is supporting the entire weight of the orbiter
and secondly if you are on the mid deck are there any windows
and if not can you see
i should bring in the launch bolts
i have a couple in my office
the entire weight of the shuttle stack is supported on the two solid rocket boosters so the bottom skirts of the boosters are actually sitting on the launch pad
and so on each of the boosters there are four big nuts and bolts four on each booster
they are explosive nuts
and at the moment that the solid rocket boosters ignite all eight of those nuts are split in half so that the boosters can lift off
now i asked the question what would happen if one of them didn't go
and the answer was well we think that the booster is strong enough that it would just rip it out but nobody wants to find out
obviously these are redundant explosive bolts or nuts
they did have on one flight they found that one or two of the redundant firing units did not fire
and that got people's attention
and i don't know what the final resolution was
but basically those bolts you know if there is wind blowing and the shuttle is rocking back and forth all of that load is taken through those bolts
the structure of the solid boosters has to be able to accommodate that
you asked me another question as well
oh the mid deck
the hatch where the crew gets in has a window in it
before challenger one seat in the mid deck was right next to the hatch
my first flight i actually sat next to the hatch during ascent downstairs but had a great view out the window
now after challenger we have an ejection pole a telescoping pole which is suspended from the ceiling
i think we talked about this before
if the shuttle is in a situation where it is in stable flight but you cannot make it to a runway at about forty thousand feet you blow the hatch
the telescoping pole you release the pin the pole will extend and then one by one you clip onto the pole and you jump out
and the pole takes you below the wing so that you won't hit the shuttle structure
and then eventually your parachute will open
that now takes up the area over by the window and the three seats no longer have a view
if you're sitting on the mid deck how during a launch how do you know what is going on
you hear the comm loop
and if you have a nice commander he will tell you
for instance if you have a rookie astronaut onboard they want to know when they go through one hundred kilometers because that means you have officially been in space and you can get your astronaut wings
so if the commander is nice he will call one hundred clicks on the way up and congratulate the new rookies
but basically that is about it
and the same for entry you don't have a view
there are still plenty of physiological things to keep your attention so it is not like it is a boring ride but you don't have the view
ok
let me run the entry picture here
ok
oms engine ignition is when you see that big flame pattern
during the burn you don't see anything
now looking out the front you see the plasma sheath
it goes from a dull red gradually to orange and then eventually white hot
you can only see this at night
it is fairly faint but typically a lot of flights you land during the early part of the day on the ground
and of course you do your burn halfway around the world so the early part of your entry is very often at night and then you fly into the day
and then i think there is another shot looking out the aft window where you actually see the plasma wake in the back of the shuttle
and you can see this is the old fashioned computer screen
that is the wake looking out the overhead window
and where these converge that little point there they say is about ten thousand degrees fahrenheit which is the surface temperature of the sun
it is remarkably stable although every once in a while you get those instabilities
and every once in a while you get big bright things go flying past which i assume are gap fillers coming out
and i remember i would always think to myself i hope that is nothing important
you're basically riding on a meteorite because it is supposed to make it all the way down to the earth
but that is essentially what you are seeing that trail behind you
and i am sure you have all seen these landings
remember all the talk about the landing gear and the brakes
i looked for a video from my first flight to show you the blowout
i couldn't find one but if i find one i will bring it in and show you another time
this is a landing out at edwards
have you ever landed at night
i have landed at night
i was going to show you one other
it doesn't have a landing light does it
no
do they light up the runway
yeah
they have two banks of xenon lights which light up the runway for you
actually this next video is from my last flight where we deployed the tethered satellite
i am not going to show you all that stuff but i wanted to show you the launch sequence because we have a few pictures showing the opening of the payload bay doors
and then you can actually see back to the aft end of the shuttle where you have the main engine
and remember i talked about how the hydrogen and oxygen have now combined into water and that forms ice
and so for the first day or so on orbit there are just constant ice particles coming out of the engines and you are surrounded by this cloud of ice
unfortunately the pictures are black and white because it is low light level tv but visually it is spectacular because these little ice particles glint in the sunlight
and they are rotating so they go through all the different colors of the spectrum and you are surrounded by this
you will also see one of the rcs jets firing
water deluge
main engine sequence
again you see the whole tilt
when it gets back to vertical we take off
this is a much shorter sequence here for the launch than the last one
how does it roll
the srb boosters go like that
is it the entire stack or just the lower
no it is just the nozzle at the bottom
this was columbia
you can always tell columbia because if you look at the vertical stabilizer up here that is an infrared pod
i will talk about that in a minute
the payload bay doors open right away
and so now you can see when we've done the engine vent you can see all the ice particles coming out
and you will see a primary rcs thruster go in there
it can be pretty spectacular
and that just keeps going for about a day and then you've gotten rid of most of the ice particles
ok
that is enough of that
yeah
that was a primary rcs thruster
yeah absolutely
in fact all of the vernier thrusters are downward thrusting only
remember we talked about with the primary thrusters they were designed and sized for rendezvous where you actually have to have controlled propulsion
and if you want a z propulsion of the shuttle you want to be able to get a pure z so you fire thrusters on each end
and the same for roll and yaw
and you don't want a lot of cross coupling because you're targeting your burn to fractions of a foot per second in order to get your rendezvous to come out right
and so that is when you're using the primary thrusters
other than that the primaries use a lot of propellant
and so we disable the primaries and use the verniers
with the verniers there are two verniers in the nose which are sort of canted down at about forty five degrees
and in the rear there are two pointing straight down and two pointing straight out
typically for a given maneuver you will fire only one or two
if you want to do a roll for instance you will fire the forty five degree down forward thruster and the downward pointing aft thruster
but they are not completely balanced so you will get a little bit of pitch and a little bit of yaw
and you don't use the verniers for propulsion at all
although because all of the verniers are essentially downward firing if you are for instance station keeping if here is the space station and you're in the same orbit but say half a mile in front of it now you're station keeping using your vernier thrusters typically that does give you after a while a little bit of propulsive maneuver which pushes you in
so you have to compensate for that
the verniers are single string
there is no redundancy
they do have access to access cross coupling
they are designed for attitude control only twenty five pound thrusters are reasonably efficient
i thought at the end we could explore a little bit together some of the ideas of improvements to the shuttle which you are going to be thinking about
and one of the things that i thought would be interesting to think about you know we talked about the fact that if you're designing the shuttle to the same set of requirements that were originally put on it your ability to change some of the major physical characteristics of the shuttle are very limited
we can do a lot with electronics and some of the other systems
the new vehicle the crew exploration vehicle is being designed not just to go to earth orbit but they want a vehicle that can actually return to the earth from the moon or from mars
that means instead of an orbital velocity of five miles per second you have a reentry velocity a hyperbolic velocity of about eight miles per second
does anybody remember the relationship between low orbital velocity and escape velocity
if your lower velocity is v what is your escape velocity
square root of two v
that is a nice thing to remember
it is an easy way to keep those things straight
first of all you don't need wings to go to the moon
they don't do you much good when you get there
to have a winged vehicle that you can thermally protect against a hyperbolic reentry velocity just doesn't make sense
it would be too heavy
we don't think we can do that
and in fact the russians are now talking about building this new clipper vehicle which possibly will have wings on it or be a lifting body
and that actually probably means that they will only use it for low earth orbit
but it does bring up the interesting question if you are designing a vehicle that is only designed to go to earth orbit as a passenger carrying vehicle one of the first things that we ought to ask ourselves if we're doing a new design is should we have wings
think a little bit about the advantages and disadvantages of wings
if you're sitting down now with a blank drawing board going through a design process first of all what are the advantages of wings
you've heard quite a bit about shuttle aerodynamics
what advantages do you get from using wings during a reentry
and obviously it's only during entry that the wings are going to help you because they are a real nuisance during ascent
greater cross range
cross range helps with the wings
the glide
yeah it allows you to land on a runway
in terms of having to design against the shock you know the crew exploration vehicle is going to land with parachutes
and they still don't know are they going to use airbags or retrorockets or crushable structure or whatever
they don't know
but it is going to take a much harder hit
that may potentially affect reusability maintainability
yeah
i was going to say just purely control while coming back in
well we had the cross range
but targeting i guess too
targeting
if you were to land say in a certain part of the desert in new mexico you would want to have a lot more accuracy
right
for the cev they are just basically saying they are going to land out in the western desert somewhere
now the apollo shots were getting pretty accurate
the last couple of apollos landed within visual range of the aircraft carrier that went to pick them up so they were getting pretty good
but that's within a couple of miles which is fine when you're landing in the ocean
and maybe it's ok if you're landing in the western desert
it is certainly not ok if you're going to land on a runway
hardly an engineering consideration but how much thought in the design was put into making it a winged vehicle for it to be a comfortable and familiar look to people especially if the idea was to have nonprofessional astronauts fly
it seems more comfortable to get in something that looks like an airplane
i don't know about comfort from that point of view but there is no question that the whole aviation metaphor dominated discussion in the early days
and i think you have gotten a sense of this
the idea was we want a reusable vehicle
that means we have to have airline type operations
well if you're going to have airline type operations then you want a vehicle that lands on the runway
you take it into the hangar
you turn it around
you launch it again
i mean it's a very powerful metaphor
what are some of the disadvantages of wings
what are some of the things that argue against wings
again we're going right back to the conceptual design exercise here
and this is not what you're doing for your papers because we're totally changing the concept of the shuttle
but for the purpose of the class let's think it through
what are the disadvantages of wings
i think a lot of what we talked about is initial design cost versus you know and no wings obviously has a lot less initial design cost because you don't have to design the structure to support the wings and it is a lot simpler design i think
so that probably saves you money in your initial development
now on the other hand i don't know how much any of you have studied the theory of reentry bodies but the reentry of a ballistic capsule typically gives you much higher gs than you can get if you have a lifting body
and of course with wings you get much more lift
you can actually decrease the g loading so that with the shuttle we can have a reentry pulling no more than about one point five gs
whereas you come back in a capsule even from low earth orbit and you're going to be pulling four point five six gs
and that does relate back to the idea that we wanted the shuttle to be able to take much more delicate payloads and hopefully take people who were not necessarily trained astronauts
so again it's an advantage but a disadvantage of wings
the area under the wings is huge so that puts huge demands on your thermal protection system
i don't know what they're going to end up using on the cev but it is going to be a much smaller area that has to be protected
another interesting thing when you think about a winged vehicle like the shuttle now i know that buran the russian shuttle made its one flight unmanned
they had some tense moments at the end but they did manage to land it successfully
but the way we fly our shuttle we have to have two trained pilots who spend a tremendous amount of time doing nothing but learning how to land the shuttle
sometimes we don't think about the crew requirements on the design but training is not an insignificant part of the cost of operating the shuttle
there is a huge enterprise involved in training astronauts
and training pilots particularly is very expensive
you have to keep them qualified as pilots so nasa maintains a fleet of t thirty eight supersonic jets which are great fun
i mean i love to fly backseat in them
but the only justification for having them is if somebody is going to be a pilot they have got to stay current as a pilot which means you have got to fly
and we have the shuttle training aircraft which i have spoken to you about
and we have all the simulator time
and then we have the problem that people said there was a time when they were talking about having the shuttle spend extended periods of time up at the space station you know a month maybe two months make some adjustments to the shuttle system so you can do that
then the problem is well who is going to land the shuttle because i talked to you about the spatial disorientation and everything that you feel during reentry
well you don't want a pilot to do that
and if a pilot has been up in the space station for one or two months has not had any stick time is going to have potentially serious neurovestibular problems during entry
and so the real question was what's the maximum time that it is ok for a pilot to spend in space
we will never actually have to answer that because seventeen or eighteen days was the maximum shuttle mission
that turned out to be ok
and we are never going to do long duration missions with the shuttle and the space station
yeah
no
they learn a lot of the malfunction procedures but you don't actually fly the ballistic capsule
i mean i am not in any sense denigrating the training that the apollo astronauts needed to land their capsule but it did not compare in the least to the amount of training for instance to land on the moon where you were actually piloting the vehicle
ok
well i hope just that very brief exploration will make you think about designing new vehicles from a slightly different point of view
in other words when we designed the shuttle it was just assumed as gospel essentially that if you want a reusable vehicle put wings on it
i don't know what the right answer is
it probably depends on some of the details of the mission but you really have to go back and question your most basic assumptions
when you're doing your concepts and you're setting out your requirements you don't want to write your requirements in such a way that they presuppose the technical solution
if you write your requirements for a winged vehicle you have already shut down a whole part of designed space
and as designers you don't want to do that
yeah
last question
no
the russians have actually taken my understanding is they have taken some of the electronics out of capsules and reused internal parts
but the exterior shell of the capsules i don't believe have ever been reused
ok
we will see you thursday
bob ried is going to give a talk on aerothermodynamics
and i will look forward to seeing your journals
any questions on the reports the outlines that i returned email me come to see me
i am happy to talk with you about it
today doctor robert ried bob ried is going to talk to us about aerothermodynamics
he got a bachelor's in mechanical engineering here at mit a few years ago and then went on to get a doctorate at rice university
and he has done a lot of things
you all have the biographies on the website so i hope you've looked at that
and like i say it is better for you to read it rather than me to take five minutes at the beginning just going through it
but he has played an important role in developing both the theory and the practice of atmospheric reentry both for apollo and the shuttle
and in fact in many ways the experience gained through apollo allowed us to design the systems for the shuttle
and so he is actually going to talk about both apollo and the shuttle comparing and contrasting
and i think it is going to be a very interesting opportunity for all of us
and i am going to let professor cohen say one or two more words
what i want to say is that doctor ried has done a fantastic job in understanding aerothermodynamics
if you look back on apollo that was one of the technologies we really didn't understand
coming in at thirty six thousand feet per second from the moon in various atmospheres what was going to happen
and in that era we had to do a lot of research and development to understand the methodology of doing aerodynamic heating
the systems engineering comes in as you heard bass redd talk about the aerodynamics you heard tom moser talk about the tile system or the thermal protection system and doctor ried sort of tied that together
because he actually came up with based on the trajectory you were flying based on the atmosphere based on the materials that you had what the surface temperatures were going to be and how you designed the thermal protection system to withstand those temperatures and still maintain the back face temperature at a suitable level
i have a couple of displays for you and if you can start looking at them
the first is a specimen that came out of apollo ten
that was a lunar orbital mission and it is a core sample out of an ablative heat shield
it shows you the thickness of a thermal protection system was about two inches and the depth of the char layer is about an inch
and we always used to give doctor ried a hard time why couldn't we take some weight out of the heat shield
but he always said he never flew the design reference mission
and he will talk about that a little bit
so that is one specimen
the other specimen is a tile that flew on the one hundred two mission four times i believe that it got to two thousand eight hundred degrees fahrenheit
the ablator got to forty two thousand degrees fahrenheit
these will give you some examples of what the results of doctor ried's work was in terms of designing the ablator for the apollo vehicle and the tiles for the shuttle vehicle
that is really a systems engineering job
i hope you can appreciate understanding the aerodynamics understanding the guidance
navigation and control trajectory that you fly and understanding the materials that you're going to use
that is really a systems engineering problem
let me now turn it over to doctor ried to put all the details together for you
thank you
good morning
we are going to try to cover an awful lot of ground here in short order
first i am going to try to go through aerothermodynamics in terms of the discipline and give you an understanding
i am going to try to relate to what you've had in your basic heat transfer and fluid mechanics courses to actual application and where the technology is today
i am also going to as aaron said go back to apollo which is really where the rubber hit the road in terms of being able to enter things at those types of velocities
and then i will get into how that affected the shuttle
and the shuttle is a revolutionary system in many ways but particularly in terms of the technology associated with aerothermodynamics computational fluid dynamics in particular
and i am really going to talk about three levels of aerothermodynamics which i will explain as i get into it
and then i will try to get into the systems engineering as aaron mentioned
and in fact one of the major differences between apollo and shuttle which we had to accomplish is a significant accomplishment in systems engineering which i hope to get into
first i don't think people generally appreciate the perimeters of what we're working with
traveling at orbital velocity due east twenty five thousand feet per second that is about five miles a second
and the orbiter is about a quarter of a million pounds
and i am sorry i am going to use a lot of english units
a quarter of a million pounds is a pretty good sized system
picture that at logan airport and one second later in this classroom
that is five miles a second
another way of looking at it is that is about one hundred twenty five tons
if you take a supertanker about a half a million ton and just convert the energy that supertanker would be traveling at two hundred fifty knots
that is the energy that we have to dissipate
norm augustine introduced the concept of rocket scientist
our job was to dissipate that energy
if i was coming back from the moon that supertanker which is about a billion pounds a half million ton would be traveling about four hundred knots
almost twice the amount of energy
actually the whole problem was relatively simple
basic parameters are first free stream density of the air that you're flowing into the velocity that you're moving at and unit area that the mass flux is just density times velocity
the momentum that that air has relative to you per unit mass is the velocity so this is the momentum flux which basically is the pressure to a very high accuracy
the energy that the gas has relative to you is one half v squared
and so we're looking at an energy flux coming to the vehicle one half rho vq
those are very important parameters
now i am going to focus on accuracy and not on precision
people have gotten lost in details in terms of getting parameters
if you've got density and velocity you basically have the gas parameters with some major exceptions which i will get into
and that is relative to the equation of state if you want the constitutive relations
the other thing is the geometry which is the major difference between the apollo and the shuttle
all right
now let's go back to the apollo system a nice simple system flying at angle of attack
one of the first problems that i was introduced to was a newspaper publication saying this system is going to burn up
it is going to burn up from the thermal radiation from the gas cap
now let's consider coming back initially at thirty six thousand feet per second
peak heating is around thirty three thousand feet per second ten kilometers per second if you want
we've got a shock free stream density
at some point we get to ideally equilibrium air
out here you're basically at ambient temperature of ten to the minus four ten to the minus three atmosphere density
here once you get to equilibrium you're operating at a temperature of about ten to the fourth degrees ranking
the effective black body radiation from the sun is ten thousand degrees ranking
the distribution in terms of the spectrum
that is the temperature of the gas at equilibrium
at the wall of the vehicle perhaps six thousand degrees ranking
and we will get into that a little bit
but what happened was there were experiments done in shock tubes indicating some very intense radiation
this gas is hot enough to radiate
and in fact at the peak heating about half of the heating is from the gas radiation
the gas is ten centimeters thick four inches and yet it is hot enough and radiates enough that the heat transfer from that radiation is almost comparable to the convective heating
the load is another matter
but what happened is out here you've got molecular oxygen and nitrogen just sitting there at ambient temperature bouncing along
all of a sudden it is swept up by this snowplow
the degrees of freedom basically two rotation three translation five degrees of freedom the gamma of one point four
go through a shock the density ratio is only a factor of six
here the density is fifteen to twenty times free strain density
and the temperature goes to one hundred thousand degrees ranking if it just stayed as a molecular gas
now in fact that temperature has no meaning other than if all the energy went into translation and rotation that would be the temperature
let me just plot temperature as a function of distance
and these were monitored in shock tubes
we worked predominantly at afco with an electric wired discharge in helium
and we could get to ten kilometers per second or twenty two thousand feet per second
conceptually what happens is if you plot temperate as a function of distance here ambient temperature is negligible
initially theoretically you've got this ten to the fifth so your translational temperature comes down to ten to the fourth
and i will talk about the dimensions here after a while
but the initial collisions i mean basically the molecules are piling up into other molecules
quickly you have collisions that give rise to vibration ionize the electronic energy levels in the molecule
once it is vibrating it will also dissociate so then you've got ionized atoms as well
and we have characterized these as basically temperatures a vibrational temperature
again this is a very non equilibrium situation so the concept of temperature really goes away but it is sort of a measure of energy to equate for example vibrational and electronic
now what happened was i mentioned how significant the radiation was from the equilibrium
in the shock tube the radiation in this region where the energy has not distributed itself into an equilibrium level was two orders of magnitude higher
that led to the publication you cannot bring people back from the moon
that radiation is just going to vaporize the capsule
now things were with us
the time to relax and the measurements of radiation if you want were extremely intense and then they relaxed to equilibrium levels
it turned out that we used what was termed a binary scaling
this relaxation distance depended on how many collisions you had
collisions depended on the pressure
the pressure depended on the density
the velocity is fixed coming in from lunar conditions
it gives you the pressure
in the shock tubes we couldn't quite get to the low pressures that we had on apollo
and i will show that in my first chart actually
but what happened is at the pressures that we experienced this distance came to be very small
and that increased the rate so that even though we had two orders of magnitude higher radiation intensity it was two orders of magnitude smaller in radiating volume
and so the non equilibrium radiation actually turned out to be a little less important than the equilibrium radiation
now the point is that before we went to the moon we didn't have the foggiest idea of what was going on
we knew that you couldn't use ideal gas we knew that you had to go to equilibrium and everybody was worried about trying to calculate equilibrium accurately
all sorts of charts and tables
we didn't have the computer capability that we have today
everybody was focused on equilibrium but then initial results in one of the major facilities for aerothermodynamics which is basically a shock tube
does everybody understand a shock tube and how it functions
basically it is a one dimensional situation just like i've described here but the way it is generated is you have a driver section and a driven section
in the driver you try to get extremely high pressure with a high speed of sound
here you have a diaphragm
here you have if you want rho infinity
this is the density that you're trying to test in
what we had was an electric wire that exploded got into the helium went to tremendous pressures
basically these were all battleship guns if you want
and we had to go to a two inch diameter tube in order to get close enough to the apollo
basically you start with a pressure distribution that looks like this
this is pressure as a function of distance
once you discharge there is a diaphragm here
the diaphragm cannot take that pressure
the diaphragm blasts and you get an expansion wave coming back here and a shockwave traveling in that direction
the reason we had to go to two feet is you get a boundary layer building up
and if you want some test gas i've kind of go this reversed here
in here you've got the shock you've got a boundary layer building up and if you have two small tubes the boundary layer will suck up the gas and you don't really have a test condition
but afco worked everything out very nicely and we had a very nice test condition
we basically had this condition going by a little higher pressure than we experienced on apollo and we could measure the radiation
the challenge at that time was the instrumentation and a quick response capability to measure all that
we learned an awful lot
we went from ideal gas like you get in shapiro to real gas equilibrium
in fact james fay in course two had done some real pioneering work looking at stagnation point heating and a gas dynamics
i am getting kind of lost in that detail but basically this was the phenomenological aspect that we had to understand in order to work with apollo
this was not why we had twice as much ablator as we needed and i will get to that later
second area what i'm talking about here basically is fluid convection and some chemistry or physical chemistry
the next significant item is diffusion
the simplest case obviously is thermal diffusion
the first thing you learn in unsteady heat transfer you have a one dimensional situation temperature initially and you have a heat input
you end up with a distribution of temperature which diffuses out
the functional form of that if you recall t is proportional to an exponential let's call this x squared over four thermal diffusivity times time and there is the square root
think of it as a one dimensional normal distribution
except instead of two variant squared here you've got four times the diffusivity time
the significant thing is when we talk about ablators when we talk about tiles or thermal protection systems this is the significant parameter
we have an extremely high temperature at the surface
the job is to keep that from the structure
thermal diffusivity is prime parameter
it is also not thermal diffusivity but if you now consider simplest fluid mechanics flat plate the first thing you learn about in terms of viscous flow
you've got some velocity coming along here
you've got a boundary layer that builds up
the boundary layer compared to x varies as one over square root of reynolds number
where does that come from
the same diffusion
it is a diffusion of the shear of this wall against the undisturbed flow whether it be the thermal diffusion associated with heat transfer the diffusion associated with the shear the same phenomena
when i first found this in fluid mechanics i was told that was empirical
and it basically is but it really goes back to the fact that if you approximate the navier stokes equations in this one dimensional situation you basically have a convection in this direction and a diffusion in the orthoginal direction
this is extremely important not just in terms of boundary layer but also in terms of the stanton number which is approximately heat transfer divided by one half rho infinity v infinity cubed for the case of a sphere
now this is a one dimensional obviously flat plat
a sphere is also one dimensional
if you look at a stagnation point on a sphere this is a singularity
if you go to spherical coordinates you've got basically the same phenomena
the diffusion from the wall gives you characteristic dimensions
it is very important because heat transfer is basically inversely proportional to the square root of the reynolds number
we have square roots showing up in the thermal diffusion
we have square roots showing up in the heat transfer
now when you put in the effects of real viscosity and everything else there is a little variation
but first order is the behavior that we are looking for
and that i will illustrate now
if we go into a wind tunnel and we measure well let's just basically go to fly
let me do local heating over the energy flux
i am going to do a logarithm of that as a function of log of what i'm going to call a normal shock reynolds number
all i do as i go across the shock the density of velocity the mass flux is conserved obviously
the viscosity is what changes
i am going to use the normal shock equilibrium air viscosity because that is more characteristic of everything going on in what the russians call a protective shock layer
if i looked at either the wind tunnel data or flight data in the region of prime concern
i've got that minus one half slope from that square root reynolds number
i will also have a bound up here that my heat transfer cannot exceed the energy flux
and obviously if you go all the way to orbit you're basically one
the molecules are coming in at orbital velocity going into the material releasing all their energy and then eventually coming off
we actually do have that limit although we never really worry about it too much
the significant heating is in this laminar regime
i feel like because i understand navier stokes equations because i understand the diffusion process and that limit of the navier stokes i sort of understand that flow
however we also have turbulent heating which incompressible flow has its slope on the order of minus a fifth
i don't really understand stand that and do not claim to understand that
it is a combination of the diffusion and the convection all sorts of things going on
and then we have transition from one to the other
theoretically this would come out and come out lower
now this is extremely important in the shuttle design as i will get to when i get the charts
but basically we go into a wind tunnel and can measure this on a particular configuration
we got to flight
and let me mention heat transfer and aerothermodynamics has been a field of study for many years
people have built models have done wind tunnel tests shock tube tests flown vehicles
and there was a lot of money spent trying to fly vehicles to verify our understanding
the difficulty certainly with ablators is measuring the environment
did you really have the right heat transfer or did the material just start to degrade
what is really going on
when we flew the shuttle we had a reusable thermal protection system which is the tile that is being passed around with a real thin coating and very low thermal diffusivity
what better instrument could you have to measure heat transfer than that
and the data from the shuttle configuration is absolutely fantastic from a technological standpoint from an aerothermodynamics standpoint
unbelievable
so much better than anything that was done in the past with vehicles that were dedicated to try to get that information
let me say a couple words about well first let me address the facilities
i mentioned the shock tube and went through that briefly
and the value of the shock tube was to look at phenomena just like this
you also can which is where professor fay got his information put a model in the shock tube
right here
and all of a sudden you've got the flow at the right enthalpy and closer conditions to flight than anywhere else
getting to these energy levels is extremely difficult
there are three facilities you can get to
one is in a shock tube
second is a ballistic facility where you fire a projectile that looks like what you're going to fly
and that does a good simulation job except it is very small
and getting any measurements is very difficult
if you go into a wind tunnel you can get great measurements but you cannot get the energy
the shock tube and ballistic facility i will just put this down here it has the difficulty of measuring things
the other place you can get the energy is in an arc jet
now an arc jet is a continuous electrical discharge sort of like the shock tube where you're discharging an arc along a tube about the length of these tables a very high current continuous for a significant period of time into nitrogen
and then you're expanding this and you're introducing a supersonic flow
and you test materials like tiles or the ablator in as close to the environment as you can get on the ground
that is for the times that are required
entry times are like twenty minutes
you need something that has the energy and runs for twenty minutes
now this is a continuous flow of electrons
the thermodynamics here is not well characterized
people have studied it like mad
this is very non equilibrium
you've got a very high density of electrons
the temperature is immense in here
it is not at all in equilibrium
but as you expand through a jet collisions drop because the pressure goes down and it pretty much freezes
but this is where we do research on ablators and research on service catalysis which i will talk about in a little bit which really can affect the heating particularly on the shuttle
and i will show you some results there
but in any event the arc jet is the other major facility from a tps materials standpoint
tps being thermal protection system
wind tunnels are classic
that's where nasa came from nac came from
aerothermodynamics is my field spelling is another area
wind tunnels you're all familiar with
and on apollo we tested in every facility you could think of because we didn't know what we were doing
and whatever the different facilities told us we tried to understand
what we learned was energy is extremely important the enthalpy
and frankly going beyond mach eight which is what everybody tried to do get to the higher mach number really doesn't work too well in a ground facility when you're talking about heating distribution
it does give you mach number effects
but the gas is not at all like what you have in flight
and so on the shuttle we didn't really do much aerothermodynamic testing beyond mach eight
that gave us the right normal shock reynolds number region it was closer to on the shuttle
the actual flight environment than if we had gone to a mach twelve a mach sixteen a mach eighteen a mach twenty facility
because the way they get the mach number there is to get the temperature very very low
it is very valuable information but you really need to understand what you're doing with that
you cannot just take mach number as the major parameter
it is a significant parameter but you need to get the reynolds number
and fundamentally you need to get the enthalpy of the gas
and there is not really a good dimensionalist number for the enthalpy of the gas
too much going on for that
the other significant source of information is flight test
in the early days with the capsules and certainly with apollo we did a lot more testing invested a lot more on testing than we do now
for example on the apollo i talked about this radiation we had very good test results in a shock tube
we thought we really knew what was going on
nasa langley went and built a small scale apollo about so big to measure the radiation in flight because the shock tubes are operating at little higher pressures than we were going to fly the apollo
it basically had three brilliant heat shields with a quartz window in it
it comes in zero angle of attack and gets to a given point where the window basically starts to melt
you cannot see through it you cannot make a measurement it sheds that
and ideally the second heat shield comes about right at peak heating simulating apollo entry
and then a third
well we were really excited about that because the shock tube was great
and we thought we understood everything
well we flew fire one
it was called fire
i don't remember what the acronym stood for but it was basically a small apollo coming in
we got the data and it wasn't anything like what we expected
what had happened
well it turned out that in order to get the high speed we launched the fire vehicle and then we fired a rocket down back into the atmosphere to simulate lunar return
everything went well
there was a spring between the capsule and the boost stage and they separated by design
fine
but what happened was the booster lined up with the wake of the incoming test vehicle and just road the wake because there was a lot less resistance where the air has been sucked along clobbered the back of the vehicle and it mutated
and so we weren't looking at the stagnation point
we were looking off at thirty degrees
not only that but the radiation was doing this
figured out the problem sorted it out and had the second flight test which worked beautifully
it turned out at altitude the radiation did not agree with the binary scaling that i mentioned
and basically the radiation profile here as i said was like two hours magnitude higher characteristically
but at high altitudes it just wasn't there
at peak heating it was
but prior to that which was a significant heat load it was not
there were not adequate collisions to excite the radiators before the gas came to equilibrium
now as i mentioned before at peak heating conditions on apollo the shock i cannot draw it very accurately to scale was on the order of about ten centimeters or four inches here at peak heating
is that the thickness of the shock or the standoff distance
the standoff distance thank you
standoff distance
the shock is relatively thin a few mean free paths
and some people might call this effective shock thickness but i term the transition to higher temperature of the shock thickness and then a relaxation distance
any altitudes above that the flow could be completely out of equilibrium
it hasn't gotten back to equilibrium because this characteristic time is directly proportional pressure
and i erased it
it is directly proportional to free strain density
so at higher altitudes it out of equilibrium
as you will see shortly shuttle is much higher altitudes than apollo
and i will explain why
at lower altitudes this compresses and is predominantly at equilibrium radiation
and that we were able to characterize
ok
back to ways of getting information
numerical simulation
this is a significant revolution that you're probably more familiar with than i am but it really occurred right through the development of the shuttle
and frankly well i will show this in charts in terms of the design approach to getting the aerothermodynamic environment at flight used the same technology that we used in apollo
and that was we take a scale model go into a wind tunnel
now this is a blunt vehicle and so if you look at it as an inviscid flow the close to normal shock entropy is basically the entropy of the entire body inviscidly
and so the normal shock or strong shock gas dominates the flow around the vehicle
as you go low angle of attack you get into an entirely different situation
in any event what happens in terms of the wind tunnel the heating here compared to different distributions is all pretty much proportionate
and that is fundamentally what we used
and that included even the wake region back here
and i will talk more about that when we get into the charts
on the shuttle we get into far more complicated geometries
and the major challenge on shuttle was that three dimensional geometry
and we did a bunch of numerical simulation development
we had focused on the subsonic region on apollo which basically is most of the front side here is basically subsonic
about the middle of the vehicle down is supersonic
and then of course you get into the wake here
this was our flow field interest on apollo primarily because of this radiation
we had to understand the flow field in order to be able to compute the radiation
about half of that radiation is optically thick from the ultraviolet deionization radiation and also line radiation from atoms
optically thick
the other half the radiation is basically optically thin the molecular band radiation and other things
we needed to understand the flow field
we did some pretty crude engineering calculations in order to get that flow field but we were focused on getting to a numerical simulation of the subsonic region in particular
now in those days the computer was our real limitation
and of course it was sort of embryonic
we have collectively just become orders of magnitude beyond where we are today
however the design approach that i would recommend now is basically what we would like to have used on the shuttle
and to an extent we did
before we actually flew the shuttle we had confidence as a result of numerical simulation
it is a combination of these facilities and numerical simulation
this problem of non equilibrium is kind of beyond numerical simulation in my opinion
now you can correlate things but i would like to point out the limitations
you don't just go get a computer program and you calculate everything because there are some very fundamental things missing
the way one gets reaction rates for example dissociation rates or recombination rates is to go into a shock tube
as you approach equilibrium the concept of temperature the equilibrium constant makes sense
so you can relate forward and backward rates
and you do diagnostics spectroscopically on a concentration and you get rates
and it gets to be kind of complicated
there was a lot of stuff back in the early apollo days said in terms of coupling between the different modes of vibration the electronic excitation
it is a pretty complex problem
but coming to equilibrium is where we get our reaction rates for high temperature gases
coming back here we're not close to equilibrium
temperature doesn't work
unless you start with an end body problem and schroedinger's equation you're not going to really be able to compute this
now what is used in the field right now is the basic data and a jump condition in terms of what matches the relaxation condition
i am not knocking it
all i am saying is there are limitations to numerical simulation whether it be in physical chemistry or just about anything you work with
at the same time it is invaluable in terms of relating what happens in a wind tunnel and what happens in flight or what happens in an arc jet and the phenomena
i will say a little bit more about that as we get into the charts
before we flew in regions of the vehicle i made statements which i still would make
we could compute the heating on a wind tunnel model about as accurately as you could measure it in regions
not over the entire region
not over the separated region
not over conditions where the flow was turbulent
but in the laminar environment we could compute it as well as you could measure it
that is outstanding because now if i say i've got a program i can tell you what the heating is i can tell you all about the aerodynamics i can tell you everything
good
run it on a wind tunnel test
i will take the data you run it on the wind tunnel test and we will see if we agree
you've got a validation of numerical simulation in terms of the geometry in wind tunnel in terms of the chemistry in shock tubes or ballistic facilities for that matter and certainly in terms of flight test
and you've got shuttle data and a lot of code validation for that shuttle data
now this is just from the heating standpoint
i haven't talked very much yet about the thermal protection system or the structure and the rest of the things
let me say just a few things about configuration and then i will say a few things about the thermal protection system and then we will go to some charts that has some real information on it instead of just a hand waving that i'm doing right now
configuration
i mentioned dissipating this energy
george truhall was in charge of the thermal protection system on apollo
and i used to come to him and say wow we take care of ninety eight percents of that energy by putting it into the air
we compress the air heat the air
you only have two percents to deal with a small percentage
and he used to come right back to me and say i do the same thing
i get rid of ninety eight percents of it and only two percents gets to the structure
and in fact that it is true
by design if you look at a meteor coming in the surface will vaporize
and depending on the angle of momentum if it rotates it will vaporize all the way around on the outside
and some of it will come in
in fact professor fay wrote a wonderful paper about meteors what become meteorites and what are meteors
an excellent paper
put it in a real perspective
broad range much broader than what i'm talking about here
the way george was able to get rid of this heat was by re radiating
and this has been kind of unique to manned vehicles
fundamentally you've got a vehicle coming in you've got a surface with the capsules far exceeding the material capability
the heat flux coming in here gets you to temperatures that are far above any material capability
and so what happens is the material degrades and is called an ablator
and the initial concept and application for ablators is as the material vaporizes it basically pushes the air away to reduce the heat
and this is sort of what happens in meteors if you want
so you lose some of the initial material
and that sample that aaron passed around that black material well it was a little thicker when it started than the sample that he has
but you see this what we call char layer where the material is decomposed
that generates a gas which at high pressures and high heating rates basically tends to absorb the energy that is coming in through the chemical reactions primarily and also due to the blowing
but a fair more effective way of getting rid of that heat for us in manned spaceflight at the higher altitudes was to re radiate it
how do you draw re radiation
i guess sort of a wavy line
radiation is always a wave right
and so first order ninety eight percents of this energy goes into heating the air which flows around the vehicle
the other two percents that gets to the vehicle george re radiated ninety eight percents away with a high emissivity high temperature surface
now in the ablator that char think of it as a charcoal briquette
you start with some material
it degrades and all sorts of chemical reactions go
if you've got a good ablator for our application what happens is you're left with a residual char which is black and very high emissivity
it is pure carbon if you want
that is the challenge is to get a carbon surface or a high emissivity high temperature surface that can re radiate
just to remind the class what is the most efficient radiator
black body there you go
thank you
high emissivity black body radiation get rid of all that energy before it ever has to diffuse through the tile or through the ablator to get to the structure
that is fundamentally what we use to protect the vehicle
now while i'm on that the ablators were developed for capsules
and we kept getting lower and lower density because we wanted to minimize the diffusion of energy from the surface
there needed to be a substant enough surface to hang together
i mean if you just have charcoal and blow on it it's not going to stay there
with the early capsule with the apollo we had a fiberglass structure in there that basically retarded the ablator from flowing away
now everybody tells us we were twice too heavy on the ablator on a capsule
and i will explain that in a bit
it's a systems engineering problem we got away from it on shuttle so pay attention when i get to that problem
in any event we were a factor too high over most of the vehicle but not in this region
on that region we were right on
not by knowing what we were doing just by luck
when you say right on what you're saying is that the char layer went essentially all the way into we hit our temperature requirement on the structure
if i blow that up a little bit i've got a surface here of ablator which is paralysizing and charing
and i've got a flow over the vehicle
i've got one heck of a pressure grid
and i just described this char
it's a nice porous carbon like a charcoal briquette
ever blow on a charcoal briquette
you can blow your air right through it and it flames up
that's exactly what happened here
we had flow through
the honeycomb wasn't as a high a temperature as the carbon
that was just there to hold it as the system degraded
so the combination of the two dimensional flow which we really hadn't simulated on the ground all we could do in the arc jet was basically little pucks to test the ablator
you're dealing with an awful lot of energy and if you spread that energy over a large surface the enthalpy basically goes down
the heating on the surface goes down
we were testing six inch specimens characteristically
we really didn't get the flow through
in fact we eliminated the flow through because we had one dimensional models and we wanted to understand the process of one dimensional
but in flight fortunately we were a factor or two over just in that region
over this region and i will show you a chart we were way over
and again i will try to address that
and again the shuttle has really helped us in understanding the leeside flow
configuration
everybody has got their own requirements for configurations
from a heating standpoint i want to put all that energy into the air so i want a maximum drag configuration
i just want a flat plat normal to the flow
well that's wonderful
it's high drag but it's not stable at all
let's go to a sphere
now the center pressure no matter where the pressure is on the vehicle no matter what the pressure is it goes right to the center
and that is probably also about the center of gravity if i flew a sphere
certainly if it was solid but if i build a spherical spacecraft it would be neutrally stable
well that would be great
i could spin it and distribute the heating over the entire thing
as they enter that happens to some meteors
well it's not too comfortable and i don't have control and i also generate a little left
there are all kinds of problems with that
one other problem if i use just a section of a flat plate if i look at the heating distribution if i plot the heat transfer in this direction from ground test not from flight from ground test you have some level of heating
but then when you get to the corner it really goes up because of pressure gradient
the same thing that we experienced on apollo in terms of the ablator
so you want to give it some curvature not only from the standpoint of stability but also from the standpoint of the heating distribution
and indeed if you look at the apollo at zero angle of attack it pretty much has almost a uniform heating distribution
that is very efficient
i can design my thermal protection system to be so thick and i manufacture it produce it over the entire surface exactly the same
that is wonderful except i still have the corner problem
and so i round the corners a bit
this is only from an aerothermodynamic standpoint now
and so i don't have this corner edge heating problem nearly as much
well that's fine except a zero l d vehicle gets kind of high gs coming in and you don't have much control
and i will address a little bit of that and you've probably already heard about the flight mechanics control
in any event i need some l d so i got to angle of attack
in order to go to angle of attack i have to take the center pressure which is basically the point about which the aerodynamic forces if i put a string and pulled on that that's how the aerodynamic forces are acting on that
and i want the center of gravity ahead of that
and now i've got a nice stable configuration
not too stable because the control people want to do things with it but stable from the standpoint of not having to fire rcs jets or have control surfaces and all that type of thing
that is how we designed apollo
it worked very well
and in fact if you look at the shuttle at angle of attack with some liberties son of a gun
in two dimensions
in three dimensions it is significantly different
i think i'm about ready to go to the charts now
ok
why don't we take a two minute break
we usually break about ten point zero
great
and i will get the charts set up
good
quick stretch
turn around
i didn't ask if there were any questions
i expected everybody to just raise their hands and start asking questions
but since there are no eight point zero classes this is the first class of the day maybe that's why we're not getting any questions
that was my hand waving
i am going to get into specifics here after the break
i have a series of charts
most of these came from a technical conference that professor cohen had after the shuttle test flights
we had five test flights just for information
we had seventeen flights in mercury before we put a man in the vehicle
on apollo we never put a man on the vehicle or did anything before we had a test of the systems in the vehicle before we'd put a man in it with one exception and that was the actual lunar landing
we couldn't really simulate that very well
we couldn't test that
on the shuttle we did as much testing as we could but the design constraints forced us to go with men in the system initially
and that was the least riskiest thing to do considering everything
that's a whole different subject
all right
this first chart is altitude in thousands of feet and velocity in feet per second
what i've shown here is first of all this is one atmosphere total pressure
this is a tenth of an atmosphere total pressure
and first i would like to focus on the apollo orbital return and i am going to show data from actually one of these flights
these bands are to show the flight regime
and this is the lunar return coming back thirty six thousand feet per second and then essentially going through an orbital entry
you can see there is an order of magnitude difference here
i'm sorry
here is the shuttle
this was the design coming from a polar orbit at two hundred sixty five thousand feet per second
and these are the orbital flight tests the five flight tests
they are all laid together here and you cannot really see much of a difference
now this is the heating boundary
if we went beyond that the tiles degrade
now i mentioned three levels of aerothermodynamics
the design level well i'll get into the design level a little bit later
the first level was basically the apollo technology
that was we went to the wind tunnel we correlated the distribution of heating on the shuttle relative to a reference and we used the one foot sphere as a reference
and i gave that to the flight mechanics people and said do not violate these constraints
so they developed the flight mechanics control and everything else to fly right along here
now what isn't shown is we anticipated transition
and i will show that in time histories
there is another boundary for heating that actually comes along here
these trajectories are very tight relative to having a re usable thermal protection system and not having to completely refurbish the vehicle
that was the target
if we wanted a reusable system we could turn around and fly again
you've seen the ablator from apollo and you've seen tile that really had some severe environment from the shuttle
but basically here we have a simple configuration
here we had a much more complex configuration
we had capability to fly it and we had capability to avoid excessive heating
it takes about twenty minutes to enter
ten minutes along this heating boundary where basically your heating rate comes up and you are on a plateau
and you will see that in just a minute
that contrasts the apollo and the shuttle
and i mentioned on apollo we did a lot of shock tube testing trying to get into this environment about thirty three thousand feet per second for peak heating when this thing comes down to also about max pressure on this chart anyway
but shuttle was significantly higher altitude significantly more out of equilibrium which is the bad news
the good news is the radiation was not that significant
in fact when we calculated what the astronauts would see coming in on apollo when they were looking out the windows on the wake it was extremely bright
this is just in the wake which is orders of magnitude down from the radiation on the front side
on the shuttle we suggested a one hundred watt light bulb behind a table
it worked beautifully in the simulator
significant change in environment from apollo at thirty three thousand to thirty six thousand feet per second to orbital environment
the heating basically increases
in this direction i don't show a difference
mars return is like forty five thousand feet per second
the convective heating goes up as velocity cubed
the radiation probably goes up by two orders of magnitude
the radiation is very very sensitive
some of the people at ames did correlations with velocity and with temperature
and there were numbers like a temperature to the eighth power a temperature to the twelfth power because it is not limited by black body over a lot of the spectrum
and as the temperature goes up there are more and more radiated degrees of freedom
it gets much closer to a black body
radiation becomes dominant on a mars return
on lunar return it is a problem
however if you look at the radiative heating it is first order proportional to two dimension
whereas a convective heating is just the opposite it is inversely proportional square root
as you go up in dimension your convective heating is less important as we did with the shuttle
and i will try to address that
so we don't really have an ablator type of material that would work for mars return
i think we could develop an ablator
but we would have to do it in an environment that gets as close as we can to simulating the radiation
and these days there is a lot more capability there than there was in apollo days
but that is a real challenge
yes
i have a couple questions
sure
that was the basic flight mechanics that dissipate the energy
and actually i will get into this a little bit more on the next chart and then go through an entry
you wanted to not exceed the deceleration
actually from an ablator standpoint one of the most efficient ways to come in is hot and heavy
go to max heating rate but keep that time down
you remember i mentioned the square root of time on the diffusion of the energy in
you want to keep that time down
and you're better off taking your lumps on heating rate
heat load is really what designs
did that answer your question
this is the flight mechanics and i'm not an expert on that but basically this portion was designed to capture
if you don't capture you're gone for another two weeks
and so you didn't want to get beyond twenty gs because nothing would take beyond twenty gs obviously
you didn't want to skip out
this is a linear plot
you're looking at an atmosphere and you're coming in at high speed
i want to make sure you capture it
not too steep or you're blown apart but if you miss you're gone for another two weeks
first thing is capture
dissipate that energy
then we worry about getting down to a landing point
in terms of corridor they term that corridor the apollo vehicle had about a twenty seven mile corridor at four hundred thousand feet
if you were too shallow then you would skip out
if you were too steep in that corridor you would go in too deep and exceed the g level
coming back from the moon two hundred forty thousand miles away you basically had to a corridor about twenty seven miles in the earth's atmosphere
and that was really what the guidance navigation system did for us
and with the mid course correction of course you've got a lot of leverage but it is a very tight corridor that you've got to hit
well i can talk about it now
no i will wait until the next chart in terms of the systems engineering and everything
when i was here the computers were in the electrical engineering department and occupied an entire room
mechanical engineers like me i mean we didn't understand all that stuff
generations
design and flight test environments a lot of points i want to make here
this is a log maximum heating rate and this is the maximum integrated heat load at design conditions
now the numbers are not so important
apollo is triangles
shuttle is circles
filled is design
open is actual
let's start with the apollo
our design is up here coming back from the moon
actually there were two design points
this was the maximum load which was the thickness of the ablator
that is the weight
we picked the material
we got the best material we could
now the question is how thick do we make it
and that's the weight
here is the design condition
the heat load i mentioned before relative to the question
we didn't have the trajectories of flight mechanics when we started the design
we had to start to design the capsule the ablator and everything else in parallel with the development of the computer capability and the flight mechanics and being able to actually fly this thing
what happened
we knew we couldn't exceed twenty gs
and so give me a trajectory that comes in and hits twenty gs
i've got to be able to handle that heating rate
we also needed to capture
if we skipped out and went another two weeks that was kind of tough on the crew so give me a trajectory that just stays in
they are miles apart
that point is up here on that chart
for clarity and trying to illustrate other things it is way up here in heating rate
and there is sort of a range of entry of apollo in terms of that's the maximum you could get
all sorts of things in between
this is an actual flight
this is log paper
a significant difference
a factor of two
square root of that forty percents of that ablator that we didn't need is in the trajectory difference
but now here is the systems engineering point
when we started the shuttle we looked at apollo and said how do we get this heat shield down
well if you look at the aerospace industry or nasa you have specialists
everybody does their own little thing
i am aerothermodynamicist
george truhall was the thermal protection system guy
tom moser was a structures guy
then there was a materials guy
all these different people they all do their thing and work together as a team
we're designing a system to go to the moon and come back
boy i sure don't want to put too low a heating rate in
i mean i don't want to be the cause of a failure so i think the heating rate is going to be right here or whatever
well i don't have that level of confidence i've got some uncertainty so i will put ten percents or twenty percents at least in on my heating
the ablator guy he is testing on arc jets and he does exactly the same thing
the structures guy says well we want to do this and that
well on the shuttle for example our guideline was one hundred missions a structure that would take one hundred cycles
well if i don't exceed this temperature you know how well do i know that what is the stress level all the different variables you know this is what i expect but i better put a little pad in
there is nothing wrong with that
what was wrong is we didn't have communication with all these people
somebody gives me a trajectory and i calculate heat and i say boy this is what i think it's going to be
and i'm going to show you some of that in all honesty which you won't see in journal articles
but i better put a little bit of pad on that because i don't know this that well
they compound
we call it compound conservatism
everybody puts their ten percents in and you get your factor of two
now you just lost significant if not half the payload on the shuttle by doing that
we did not do that on the shuttle
now let me very honest
in the early days when we recognized that because we were getting beat on
you don't need all that tps
when we realized where it really came from we would go back to the management and say this is what you need to do
you need a system where you have all this communication
well that's going to be expensive
we did it but we did it informally
we did it by communicating informally everybody understanding
and we actually did a statistical assessment before we flew the shuttle to give us confidence that things would work
extremely important
i mean when you talk about systems engineering it is communication different disciplines different requirements different everything
communication between people is very important
all right
where was i
here is the orbital entry on apollo the two flight tests that we did two hundred one and two hundred two
and i'm sorry i don't remember why we called them one three four
this was a design there's another design up here
that was a conservative
all right
here are the five oft flights on shuttle heat rate and heat load and there is the design
we do not have a whole lot of margin
but as you saw from the previous chart we can fly it
we're obviously able to do it as long as the tps and the structure are intact obviously
any questions
yes
how much does your ability to control the trajectory play into that
i mean it seems like you'd be able to control the trajectory of the shuttle a lot more precise than you would apollo
yes
absolutely
you've got a body flap on there in particular to trim angle of attack
we also have rcs engines which we'd use if we would have to
and in some cases we have to
and you've got aileron settings which primarily are used later
but yes crucial
in terms of getting this level of precision you need control
but isn't the most important factor the flight path angle the angle between the velocity vector and the local horizontal at feet
initially yes
on shuttle you could modulate that
yes
and actually you see some of these wiggles you know we have highs and lows
we have hurricanes and high pressure areas but the atmosphere is an exponential decay
and any waves any ripples by the time you get to the tail end of the whip it can get very significant
and so there are density variations that you really don't know about until you hit them
and being able to control is sort of crucial there
coming back from the moon right on that initial angle is crucial and the de orbit from orbit obviously the same thing
any other questions on this before we go to the next chart
ok
all right
i mentioned three levels of aerothermodynamic methodology
one is to correlate in the wind tunnel and relate everything to reference heating or stagnation point heating which is what we did on the capsules which are good blunt vehicles
the real technology challenge on the shuttle was the geometry
it was a lot more complicated than just the shock and a stagnation point and flow around a blunt vehicle
you name it you've got it in terms of flow on this thing
now the way this was modeled in terms of when we started we didn't have computational fluid dynamics
the design methodology that was used to actually design the system was to model the flow
obviously up front here looks kind of like a sphere
and so i calculate the heating on a sphere
i go into a wind tunnel and look at the actual data and relate that and say well that's kind of like a sphere of two foot radius
so that's my heating there
i look at flow down the center line and i'm sorry this wedge isn't supposed to be wedge or a flat platted angle of attack
this flat surface down here looks kind of like a wedge
well i can calculate a boundary on a wedge given the pressure which newtonian would work fine
certainly in the blunt regions and on a wedge i can do that flow
i can do a swept cylinder for the leading edge and i can do a comb for the boundary layer
i can take diagnostics in a wind tunnel look at the boundary layer path and say boy this thing is spreading kind of like a cone
this is the design methodology
these are all one dimensional flows for the boundary layer
these are geometric flow models where the boundary layer is basically one dimensional
and even though for example on a cone the boundary layer is spreading it's still a one dimensional flow
so i calculated in a wind tunnel what the heating would be at this particular condition
i calculate for example flat plate
this heating rate has a function of distance from the nose to the tail if you want
this is what i calculate here is what i measure a little factor in there
but i assume whatever i don't know in the wind tunnel i don't know in flight too
but i take this analysis which can include the chemistry all the nice things that go on in flight
so i calibrate it to wind tunnel which is basically an empirical flow field now and i take that to flight
it works pretty well
it really does
better than my normal shock reynolds number that i gave to the trajectory guys
actually there are areas where there is significant disagreement
but mostly they are pretty consistent because they're reflecting the basic diffusion of the boundary layer and the basic physics that i tried to talk about in the beginning here
it is very important to normalize what you're doing to something fundamental
if you cannot do it on the back of the envelope have a question about it
if you cannot back it up with the back of the envelope have a question about it
so this is the design methodology
i mentioned the apollo methodology which was used for quick numbers and for trajectories
the third level is a computational fluid dynamics
i'm only going to show results from the technology that we had at the time we flew the shuttle
since then computers have done so much we can do so much more but i want to compare what we expected and what we actually got with the technology we had at the time
boundary layer transition
i talked about the boundary between the turbulent and laminar heating
characteristically and in the shuttle level your heating goes up by about a factor of three
if you go to higher reynolds numbers it can get significantly higher so you want to avoid that factor of three
our initial estimate on the effect of roughness i have to say was not as good as it should have been but the technology wasn't really there
this is the logic
and i won't go through in intimate detail
just to point out the complexity to recognize the level of effort that goes into getting a basic database to design vehicles
this is all in that document in that conference report
and there are two copies i think
i brought a copy and i think there is a copy in the library that doctor hoffman has on reserve but this is all documented in there
yes
and i won't spend much time other than to say we first looked at smooth body transition
this is heating rate versus distance
smooth body
and then we put roughness in
we actually went to cryogenic models with simulated tiles to get that boundary layer to suck down to be a little better simulation of flight
the alternative was to put bowling balls on the surface of the thing to try to trip the flow and that didn't have anything to do with physical reality
so a lot of work there
we related and took the simulations for the transition and came up with an effective roughness relative to smooth body transition
again i don't claim to understand turbulence i certainly don't claim to understand transition and certainly on a complex configuration
so then we correlated that and we had predictions
and you will see some of that in a few minutes
on the tile problem on the last mission when those little gap fillers came out do you think that it tripped the boundary layer
no i don't
on the other hand some of the people that had been correlating the various missions felt that we would
and the problem is it was the first time we had a picture
yeah i understand
we had tile gaps after we landed and we said oh gee this is the relationship
there was a lot of correlation but i'm not sure it was that valid
i really don't think so
now this is the surface catalysis
i haven't really talked about that
i talked about the gas going from molecular to dissociated ionized to weekly ionized
when you get back to the surface conditions you're back to a molecule again
now i am simplifying things here
but i think the way i look at it is you start out with a molecule you blast it apart you have atoms you get back to the surface of the vehicle
and at equilibrium now you're back to a microstate
yes
in the whole design process was the shape of the wings and the underbelly designed first and then you calculated properties
or did you have to go back and say no this redesign is impossible
because of the heating do it this way
was there a cyclic process or was it one way
it was primarily one way
here is the aerodynamic requirement in order to come in
the biggest exception of that was on boundary layer transition
that classic if the structures guys design an airplane or if the electronics guys design an airplane or the aerodynamic guys they all come out to be different airplanes
the prime thing was the aerodynamics to be able to control it and bring it in
we did alter it relative to where the thermal protection system was
the other thing we did is don't fool with mother nature
the structures guys like to make things nice and flat or cylindrical
and the flow is a continuous radius curvature type phenomenon
and that difference is very very important particularly for boundary layer transition
so we did fair the geometry to keep the boundary layer transition essentially two orders of magnitude lower than it might have been
but overall i would say predominantly it is aerodynamics
and we tried to calculate the heating to the configuration that we had
the only thing i would have preferred to have done is fly higher angle of attack which could have reconfigured the thermal protection system
the tiles are a very efficient system
they are fragile but are very efficient from an insulation standpoint
the carbon nose and leading edge are heavy and they don't insulate worth a darn
i mean that's a layer of carbon
when it gets hot it radiates out but it also radiates in
and so you have to have an insulation behind that
and in fact the way we're able to reconcile the environment with the temperature capability of the carbon is it's sort of like an oven
and it's easier to illustrate on a leading edge
just picture a two dimensional air foil at angle of attack
and a carbon section if you want covers from here to here
now if i look at the heating distribution here the heating is quite high still high over here still high over here still high over here
boy it drops off very quickly over here
well if i can radiate this energy over here this basically becomes a uniform temperature oven first order
and insulation is back here
i don't know how you illustrate insulation
insulation is back here to keep the lower temperature structure from getting too hot
i don't think a lot of people realize that but behind the carbon carbon on the leading edge of the wing and the nose there are actually tiles in there just like on the outside of the rest of the shuttle
so this is sort of a staged thermal protection system
and if we didn't do that if we put the tiles right up here then this temperature could exceed the carbon capability
by flying at high angle of attack i could reduce the amount of carbon
what was the problem going to a higher angle of attack
you said there was a conflict
yeah
the problem was one of the requirements was long cross range and you don't get that at high angle of attack
i mean high angle of attack just comes in ballistically if you want
you roll around the velocity vector so you get a little l d
but if you want to go range you need more lift so you need to drop your angle of attack
a very significant design parameter for shuttle
and if you recall the trajectories it was primarily needed from a polar orbit where you're trying to get to a particular runway
you don't have as much capability coming from polar orbit as you do from equatorial or lower inclinational orbits
you remember we were talking about energy management and i talked about how if you end up low on energy you actually have to decrease your angle of attack even more and no s turns or anything just straight in
but there is a thermal boundary
i don't remember whether it was thirty eight degrees or thirty seven but forty degrees was nominal
and you really didn't have a whole lot to play with
if you drop your angle of attack in order to increase your lift so that you can stretch your trajectory to make the runway at some point you're going to violate thermal constraints and start melting your thermal protection
there were years of concepts and vehicles that were developed and flown test vehicles with different emphasis
and there were some aerothermodynamic vehicles nice and smooth
i mean it just looked beautiful
it looked like something an architect would come up with if you want
and from a heating standpoint they worked well
but the structures guys it was very heavy from a structures standpoint to get all these compound curvatures this that and the other thing
there were also vehicles that were designed specifically from a structures standpoint
and i'm not knocking the structure people
i do a lot of structure work too
but there was one that had discontinuous two flat surfaces to be able to handle all kinds of good stuff
and that was a terrible configuration from an aerothermodynamic standpoint
so there actually was a heritage of all kinds of attempts
the big challenge was how do you land some of these things
a nice hypersonic aerothermodynamic configuration and aerodynamic configuration ok now you try to put it down the runway and it is hot
a lot of test pilots had some problems with some of these vehicles
there are all kinds of heritage of people pursuing this that and the other thing
and one of them was aerothermodynamic design
and it didn't have these big wings that we have on shuttle but it was hot as can be coming in
i think the shuttle frankly i mean i don't look at it just from an aerothermodynamic standpoint
if i look at it overall we needed all the lift we could get on landing
and as it was we had to build a pretty special runway to do that or go to the dessert
so from an aerodynamic standpoint we would like a lot higher lift
in fact that is a nice area for innovation
some of the earlier concepts for vehicles you're probably with familiar with capsules with rotogyros on them that power up as you come down
boosters if you wanted a cylindrical configuration with a straight wing on it that swings out
now you've got to lift an airplane when it comes in to land but there are problems with all of them
in that case the weight estimate for all the hardware and all that kind of good stuff was excessive
anyway that is a real challenge for design
i understand you folks are going to come up with a better design some real innovative thoughts in terms of how to marry all these different requirements
in my opinion the mindset for hypersonic vehicles was piper cubs have have straight wings ok
supersonics like this and boy hypersonic ought to be like this
i mean that's just kind of the mindset
and it kind of works
but an entry vehicle is a whole different vehicle
capsules work fine for their requirements
shuttle has been a fantastic marriage of different requirements
the challenge today and i think the reason for the class is how about some new and better ideas
it's not going to be easy but there's a big need
ok
surface catalysis
first order start with molecules in a free strain
atoms
some ionized
and then i get to a surface back here at equilibrium i am back to molecules again
they're pretty hot but they are still molecules
well professor fay did a wonderful job in looking at a stagnation point on a sphere and saying well we've got limits
if we're at equilibrium that is the chemistry is fast enough that you're always at equilibrium all the way through to the boundary layer you get this amount of heating
and that amount of heating included not just the conduction but the chemistry changes going from dissociated atoms if you want and putting that energy back into translation and rotation into molecules
or the other limit is completely out of equilibrium where all you get is the translational energy
and what happens there however is if the surface is catalytic that is i have atoms coming into the surface and they are if you want for discussion absorbed on the surface
and then another atom comes in recombines and forms a molecule that releases that energy
that is a catalytic surface
so you have sort of two limits a completely catalytic surface and a non catalytic surface in a non equilibrium environment
and that is very significant on shuttle and you will see that in some data i am going to show here in a short while
this is just the concept which again as aaron mentioned is in the report
we had to go to arc jets and spectroscopic diagnostics and flow models of what is going on in the arc jet to understand the surface catalysis of tiles and carbon
we had to model the flow and model the chemistry to come up with an efficiency
then we go to flight with similar analysis and predict and i will show some predictions of this
this is a significant phenomenon at the high altitudes low density for the shuttle
any questions on surface catalysis
i always found it amazing that you don't think of designing a space vehicle that you have to worry about chemistry
there are lots of things you have to worry about but chemistry i had never thought about
but when i first heard about the surface catalysis problem there are just so many things you have to take into account
this is the flow field
at the time of this conference and the oft flights again the design was the methodology that i explained where you use simple configurations model it and extrapolate the flight
this is sort of the level of the technology and this is at twenty percents of the vehicle length
if the vehicle length is one point zero it is zero point two zero point four zero point five cross sections
and it's just the cross flow speed contours
the only point i'm trying to make here is this is kind of the level of cfd that we had at the time
since then boy we've gone gangbusters
but this kind of the level
we did not have the finite rate chemistry in this
that is a lot more computer than we could handle
at this point we were trying to develop algorithms and grids
and as i said we could in certain regions of the body compute the heat transfer as accurately as we could measure it in the wind tunnel
but that's not at flight
that is just sort of a picture of where we were and that is where i'm focusing in terms of comparing what we expected from what we actually got
now i'm going to show results in terms of temperature as a function of time
this is the entry time from about four hundred to one thousand seconds
you notice this plateau
you're talking about twenty minutes entry and ten minutes of flying it so you don't exceed the thermal protection system
i am going to show three locations
right up here at the nose just behind the carbon mid body and aft body
now the flow field technology we had a heck of a time getting from our starting solution subsonic flow which used one particular algorithm to march supersonically down the vehicle
we succeeded in doing that prior to flying
and we were able to compute up to the point where the shocks from the wing intersect the shock from the fuselage
and then we had another subsonic region and we weren't able to handle it
now we can do that
but at the time we flew we could only compute up to about here
now this is not what you'd see in a journal
i will show you one you'd see in a journal here in the middle
this is right behind the carbon
now what we did is we computed at different times through the trajectory and then there were correlations to get the history
this is jsc prediction right here
now we didn't worry about exceeding stanton number one
that is we didn't worry about the heat transfer being higher than the energy flux to the vehicle up here because it doesn't i mean it is if you look at these numbers we should have accounted for that but it's not that important so don't worry about that portion of the curve
up here is very important
now this is temperature
and i just mentioned epsilon sigma t to the fourth
that means the heat transfer is four times a bad
we did a terrible job up here and i will get back to that
now over here what happens is i've tried to stay laminar
i come down
and this was really a stretch
we never got turbulence heating up on the nose
way beyond wind tunnel way beyond our experience base but the model just went up there
so we really didn't expect that
that was a pretty conservative boundary layer transition
and then son of a gun the actual temperature is higher than turbulent even though it would appear to be laminar
what is really going on here
this is right behind a carbon
the carbon is an oven
as the service temperature of the tile drops which drops very quickly because it re radiates
not because it diffuses
we control that
it re radiates so as soon as the heating drops the temperature drops
i mean this is almost identical to reflecting what the heating is
it is dropping like mad
and indeed we're agreeing quite well
we're kind of out of the real bad chemistry and surface catalysis which is part of the problem here
and here all of a sudden the laminar is higher than the turbulent
the carbon is this oven
it doesn't cool down
even sitting on a runway it is as hot as can be
if you think about it it's got this oven
it can only radiate out of surface and inside it is still radiating
just like when you turn your oven off at home it takes a while for it to cool down
the flow is going across the nose and actually heating the air
at least changing the boundary layer profile so that the heating is higher
how do i know that
here is your tank
over here there can be a little bit of that effect also and it takes a while to preheat the oven if you want if you're doing any cooking
there is a little bit of that
but predominantly this is the chemistry
see we come much closer together here in time
this is predominantly the chemistry
at this time this non equilibrium relaxation distance is about six inches
now we're not into radiating gas but we're certainly not into equilibrium
that is also a factor and that is not well included even today in my opinion other than through correlations of the shock in what's going on here
you won't see that on paper because we did a terrible job there
we did not exceed design material requirements
and i don't think i put anything in there about well when i get to the thermal protection system i will go through the philosophy of having confidence to fly
and obviously with our predictions we would not exceed the top capabilities so we could fly
but we were off here badly
but at least you were off in the conservative direction
well that's the way we tried to be
this i will get into
this is really what we expected to the best of our understanding
yes i was surprised at this also
we did consider service catalysis which i will show here after a while but we did not really include the nonequilibrium flow in the inviscid what i've been talking here about apollo
that was beyond our capability to do finite rate chemistry in the inviscid flow field
why don't we go to mid body now
all right
here is something you might see in a journal
right where we wanted it
and that's where we had the most confidence too
we got away from the subsonic supersonic condition
we were into a marching solution
that is as good as we could do it those days
and we knew that transition was going to be later than what we predicted because wind tunnels you've got walls
you've got all kinds of reflected noise
and wind tunnels are notoriously conservative relative to boundary layer transition
but amazingly the turbulent heating correlated quite well
and that even works with normal shock reynolds numbers
i mean when you go back and look at all of the shuttle data with a crude back of the envelope normal shock local heating to reference heating including turbulence it is amazing
it really is
first order physics seems to hang in there in spite of all the complications of chemistry and all the kinds of things that can happen
you have to be careful but overall things usually work for you
again that is academic there
if we put in a constraint it would look a lot better
that is good stuff but we can do even better now
and as you can see when i said we could do a wind tunnel as accurately as we could measure in flight basically we could do the same thing
mid body
everything is just right for the cfd folks
now we'll go to the rear where we go past cfd and more to the wind tunnel correlations and we're not doing as well
certainly on transition we knew we'd be very conservative
this is ideally how we design the vehicle
fly to temperature capability of the tile
and on this sts three that's what we were trying to do
now if we exceeded this that's all right but we don't want to exceed the material capability
and we obviously don't want to exceed the structural capability
let's see
i want to talk about surface catalysis
then we will get into the thermal protection system
i've got one chart i am going to spend a lot of time on
this is distance down the vehicle from the nose
i mean it is linear distance
there is fifty percents
this is surface heat flux at one particular time in the entry
the circles are flight data
these are catalysis experiments
this is a fully catalytic or equilibrium heat transfer
this is a zero catalysis non equilibrium boundary layer non equilibrium
the reactions are not occurring in the boundary layer
this is the flight data that opens circles
i don't remember what the measurement problem here was
and here is this point way up front you can see again
now this is a viscous flow field where we could do the chemistry but we couldn't do the fluid mechanics real accurately
this is still a mix and match
look at the difference between the measurement and the prediction
the same thing as before only i eased it by showing temperature instead of heat flux
the surface catalysis is a predominant factor
now there is some rambling in the data here depending on particular location et cetera
but our friends at ames developed a catalytic coding and they coded tiles
and they said we're going to demonstrate service catalysis so they put these tiles at these particular locations
if the whole vehicle was like that the heating would have been up here
but since there was just the tile the boundary layer comes along here and all of a sudden boom it gets hit with a different boundary condition
we've got all those atoms and they see this catalytic surface the heating goes way up and then relaxes
this is the computation and there is the measurement
indeed here is a demonstration that chemistry can be important in this flight regime
if you come down in altitude where everything starts going to equilibrium it's not that important
you're going to get this because the chemistry is going to the gas is going to react
but where we are up in altitude trying to maintain conditions so we can be reusable that chemistry is significant
now i think the next one is probably the thermal protection system
no one more measurement
this is the leeside
this is normal shock versus film heat transfer coefficient
basically heat transfer
log
log
this is the heating shown here as a function of normal shock reynolds number
now remember i said we designed the trajectories so we went up here and spent ten minutes and then came down as normal a normal shock reynolds number
and here are three trajectories with a heating on one location of the leeside
by the way max faget told me to burn a hole some place on the leeside
he didn't want too much tile there
the only thing i was able to do was we exceeded heating here because we didn't simulate the flow very well in the wind tunnel
we had to put tiles there after first flight
so i told him that was as close as we came
in any event this is heating on three trajectories through normal shock history
it's sort of like time
three different vehicles
this is to reference heat
this is our old apollo level technology
it works quite well all the way through to peak heating and then it starts to change as the reynolds number picks up and the weight characteristic changes
in ballistic facilities if you have a vehicle traveling at high speed eventually your weight goes transitional and turbulent
as you increase the reynolds number that moves forward
as that moves forward you get more mixing
as you get more mixing the gas in the wake gets hotter
and i believe that is fundamentally what's going on
it is very repeatable
we cannot get this in the wind tunnel
now we'll go to tps
no one more on the leeside heating
on the shuttle we had thermal couples located here there as many places as the aerothermodynamics could put them the tps guys but we couldn't put them anywhere
this is the two hundred one vehicle and it's on its side
i apologize because of my chartmanship
the vehicle is coming in angle of attack on here
this is the windward side where there was charring
this is white paint down here
and i'm sorry it is a terrible photograph
because of some of the protrusions we had on the first vehicle we also got some charring on this side
this is not charring
this is some charring
and it is blown up here in the way the chart was made
one point
this is the first entry heating
and the leeside was extremely important
how well did we do
how hot is it
we got the data and it was all over the place
it was down where we thought it probably should be
and it was like an order of magnitude higher
we thought that data is no good
well then we went back and realized what happened is when the control system fired jets a lot more dynamic pressure than the airflow
a lot cooler
so when i fired a jet all of a sudden it is like putting a big wing out there
tremendous disturbance
and indeed we were able to correlate firing rcs jets with when the heating was way up here
and flow times you're talking milliseconds for reaction time back then when we weren't firing a jet
unbelievable
we went to learning something
again interaction of systems
now finally this is my one and only chart on the thermal protection system which is the real hardware stuff
this is temperature versus time at a mid body location
now this is from sts one
we didn't have data until this time on that flight which is why i haven't shown much aerothermodynamic today
we only had late time data
this is the design trajectory coming in from polar orbit
our design condition was we do not exceed three hundred fifty degrees fahrenheit if we want to have a hundred flight life with this aluminum
aluminum is great stuff because it is a good conductor but it is low temperature and it expands
bond line that means at the bottom just so that everybody understands
yes thank you
those temperatures are much lower than you see on the surface of the tiles
that's after the heat has diffused
right
i think tom probably talked about the sip the strain isolation pad
i'm sure he did
this is after you diffuse through the clouds and through the rtv bonds through the sip
this is the actual aluminum temperature
now i'm talking predictions
this is what the vehicle was designed to experience
now the design prediction was right here
that was purposefully a little conservative
the guy who is building it doesn't want to lose the vehicle
he is not going to get paid plus much bigger problems but this is what we expected
this is our best estimate
and again if you recall i showed you where we really knew where the heating was
this is really a tps test right now
if you read the tps section in that report those guys with the heating they were just way too hot
right here we were right on
this is a purely tps test except it turns out it was my fault here
in any event here comes the data
this is the prediction for this particular flight sts one right here
this is what we predicted for sts one
this is what we would have predicted for design
and this is the design technology prediction which has a little conservatism in it obviously and on purpose
this is yes you can fly the vehicle with confidence
we're flying this sts one no problem
and we're pretty sure we can fly a design but things have to go right for us
we did a pretty good job along here
and this structure is intricate and everything
the thermal modeling has to take into account all kinds of geometry materials et cetera
and all of a sudden right here boom what happened
i admit to overlooking this
what happened is we opened the vents we let some air in
i mean you're up in a vacuum
you do not want to let air in when it's hot
the best way of burning a hole right through the vehicle is open a front and back door
the absolutely worst thing that could happen to you
you cannot radiate the energy
you don't get rid of that ninety eight percents
it was just like a blowtorch
but once you get down if you don't do something you've got this vacuum vehicle and you're getting atmospheric pressure coming up on you
and all of a sudden you're going to be crushed
at some point ok it's all right
we open the door
we open a vent
this particular location not all locations could experience that
and not only that but the air is expanding so it is chilled as it comes in from outside
still cold compared to what we've been working with
i overlooked that
now in fairness there are a lot of areas where there is insulation you don't get that cold air and so you cannot use it in many places
but the point is looking at the overall system and the kinds of things that could happen you could take advantage of those in designs if you're cleaver if you're innovative
and so there was not one hundred degrees a significant difference there
you could take advantage of that if you design a vehicle that you pop it at the right time and get some cold air in there because that's what we're trying to control this temperature from a temperature standpoint
the other thing in the shuttle which i'm sure tom discussed was the thermal stress
i mean if the belly gets heated and the wings don't the whole wings will pop up
that is one big integrated problem which gave us a lot of difficulty
again with the simulation and computational capability we have today i think we can do a much better job of that
and also just understanding the importance of it
i think those are all my charts
no i'm sorry
i have one more which is not a shuttle chart
we were looking at an experimental orbital transfer vehicle a low wocda vehicle running from geosynchronous to low earth orbit and then we use the shuttle to go from low earth orbit to the ground
we were trying to make that reusable because you don't want to go up and put an ablator on a vehicle in orbit on a space station
and we thought we could do that
now this is not coming back from the moon
this is coming back from geosynchronous
it's not quite as bad
we had a design
and to prove the concept we had a little model we were going to build and fly
this came from a paper i gave discussing that
basically this is the analysis and testing from research to an actual real hardware system from the fundamental equations down to numerical simulation
back of the envelope or perspective fundamentals that's kind of the fun part that i enjoy
then modeling as we do for example in the design approach on apollo
correlations of data numerical computation and then numerical simulation where you're trying to do as good as we understand with the equations
fundamental research
the technology development which is where nasa's major emphasis is
component development of systems
and finally subsystem model and system testing
you need all that stuff
you would like to go right down the matrix here have a good firm foundation so you really understand what you're doing
therefore you have confidence in doing it
and therefore you develop capability
there are no shortcuts
shuttle has done a fantastic job in both these areas all the way down to computational fluid dynamics
it is not limited just to nasa shuttle people or aerospace people
and certainly in this area in apollo but all the human space flight
we've got a lot of experience
that needs to be taken advantage of for our future systems
it is not just it looks like this or it looks like that it's going to use this system it's going to use that system
it's an overall integrated take advantage of the experience in what we've learned
yes
i just have a question about the chart
i'm just wondering if the inner section points on those lines correspond to a particular path or something like that
i used this from the standpoint of we were trying to do a flight test model
we were going to predict what happened to an aero braking vehicle coming in and so i was focused on this and also on the numerical aspect
marrying those two at this point which was the reason for this flight test
but i just thought that is applicable today in terms of where we're going in general
i didn't get very many questions
it must be because it's the first class of the day
well you were going at a mile a minute
i think we got a few in there
but yeah the content of what we've been exposed to today has been tremendous
we really want to thank you
if they want to do some simple calculations what reference would you give them
are there any simple calculations they could do
faye and rodell has the boundary layer activity
that is a crucial reference
in the paper that they have the shuttle technology conference i have a list of references that were to date in the various areas whether it be service catalysis tps you name it
and those were the best references at the time
and the individuals named many of them have gone on and done much better work
plus there are lots of younger people too
i think that would be the best source
ok bob
thank you very much
thank you
walt guy's biography is on the website
i hope you've had a chance to look at it
i will just say briefly that i guess of all the lecturers coming that walt is the only one who is still actually working actively for nasa
he is head of the automation robotics and simulation division division chief at the johnson space center
but that is not what he's talking about there
he's talking about the job that he used to do for about twenty years which was head of environmental thermal life support and crew systems
and of course the crew system includes all the space suits and the good stuff that i was fortunate enough to get to use
so i've got a personal debt of thanks to walt
aaron i think you wanted to say a couple of things so i will pass the microphone to you
yes i would like to say a few words about walt
we've worked together for many years
and walt guy has the very unique capability of being not only an outstanding engineer
a technical person but he also has a very unique capability of being a great or outstanding project manager program manager
no matter what task you gave walt he could deliver the product on performance on schedule and on time
he has that unique capability
and he's done that from the apollo program through the shuttle program
and i think you're really in for a treat to hear walt talk about the environmental control systems
he has a lot of information to offer you so without further ado let me turn it over to walt
thank you aaron
as aaron said we worked together over several programs over a long period of time
i was noticing the picture
i'm sure that wasn't put there for me
but my current responsibilities are the robotic arm you see there
that is a shuttle arm
of course there are station arms also
grapple fixture over here on the left
and the little jet pack on the tumbling crewman there is part of my current responsibilities
the twenty years that jeff mentioned i was responsible for the development of the shuttle spacesuit
so it was like it was meant for me anyway
what i'd like to do is talk about the design
i know in the syllabus it said environmental control systems
so where did all the rest of the stuff come from
if you go back in perspective the mercury gemini apollo program had the classical thing that aerospace calls environmental control systems
it was basically a cabin system
it took care of the living quarters for the crew
but in the shuttle era the responsibility of that system expanded to include more than just the cabin and thus the very long hard to say name
these are the subsystem elements of the environmental thermal control and life support system
the first area i am going to these are the areas the subsystems
the first area is the cabin atmospheric revitalization system
this is a long way of saying to take care of the atmosphere in the cabin
humans are pollutants and this is the system that takes care of that
the cabin atmospheric pressure and composition this is obviously to maintain the pressure and enough oxygen for breathing
the third is the cabin thermal control and that is the classical environmental control system
but for shuttle we've added some functions
one is the water and waste management subsystem
there are some hygiene functions required there are some recharge of the spacesuit's backpack management of the fuel cell water system the fuel cells of the electrical power supply and provide a lot of extra water
also the vehicle at this point has a dedicated active thermal control system that takes care of all of the systems in the vehicle not just the cabin systems
and then last is the airlock support subsystem
this is the eva crewman's portal to space
and so the environmental thermal control and life support system covers all these areas
what i will do is go through each one of those
the first is the cabin atmospheric revitalization system
its functions are co two and trace gas removal humidity control environmental cooling and atmospheric circulation and ventilation
again i will talk each about these
but i do want to mention that there is a uniqueness about space and that there is no convection so circulation is important
also because of the fact that there is no convection getting rid of the body heat the latent heat requires a ventilation of the crew
so each of these areas ended up as part of the system design
this is an overview silhouette of the orbiter
i will use this throughout the presentation
as you can see part of the system we're talking about now the atmospheric revitalization system is located upfront where the crew is
it is beneath the floor
and we will be talking about the systems in the remainder of the orbiter as we go along
this is a simplified schematic
i would like to start at the cabin fans
these are redundant
each fan will do the job
the next in line is the co two scrubber followed by the cooler the cabin heat exchanger
there is a bypass around that for control of the amount of cooling that is needed
as you are aware the shuttle can fly with few or many crewmen
it turns out as time has gone on we fly pretty much a full compliment
but the original design was to fly a small number of crewmen
also this does give you temperature control
the same heat exchanger provides the condensation of the water from the atmosphere
therefore you get humidity control
and then that is collected
the gas continues on
it is now chilled and is provided out to the flight deck and the middeck to the crew
then the gas from the cabin is then drawn back in through some flight deck avionics and back through the fans
so this is the basic systems schematic
i might pause here a moment to sort of explain the role of the government in the development of the shuttle
as you know the prime was rockwell
it was their job to build the vehicle
but the government philosophy management philosophy was to have ownership of the technical aspects of the design
so we had basically no excuse
if it didn't work it wasn't because the contractor did something wrong
we had to have ownership
in fact aaron as the project manager would probably look to us first as the reason for a problem as opposed to rockwell because we were the conscience of the program so we should have made sure they didn't do it wrong and provided whatever technical insight to aaron to make sure he made the programmatic decisions to make sure things were not done wrong
very early in the shuttle program i was responsible for an engineering organization
and that engineering organization wanted to own the design of the environmental thermal control and life support system
we acquired a chamber
this is a near atmospheric chamber
it is a square so it is obviously not shaped like the orbiter cabin but the volume was appropriate
and it did allow a sealed environment for testing
it would take a couple of psi delta ps
that's about all it would take
we developed a no that was a different one
ok
we developed an environmental control system or an atmospheric revitalization control system and placed it inside to do early testing
as you can see here this is the fan package
the co two scrubbers are here
heat exchange package over here
and you can tell we're not current in terms of calendar wise
the co two and trace gas removal the requirements were to maintain less than seven point six millimeters of mercury
this is certainly to provide a habitable environment for the crew
this is higher than sea level but the medics agreed that that was a completely adequate level for co two
the co two absorption came from the humidified cabin gas so the system had to accommodate that as a feed stream
the absorbent selected was lithium hydroxide
the equation was a lithium hydroxide reacted with the co two to produce lithium carbonate water and heat
and this was a single use system
it turns out that the lithium hydroxide was an old solution
the previous spacecraft had used the same solution but pretty much their solution was unique purchased production of lithium hydroxide
when we entered the shuttle era we were hoping for a long duration
and the idea was to use the commercial products to get away from special production
and so we looked around
and the navy was producing a screened special production run for their submarines
so there was a lot of use there
and so the production was reasonably upo
we decided to use the navy grade
and so we brought it in and put it in the test bed that i just showed you and did some tests and it didn't work worth a darn
you notice the loops here show that our use of the canister was much more rapid that we had hoped for
the nice beautiful deep loops here are a process that we developed to screen the navy lioh so that we didn't have to create a new production capability but were able to test the lioh that came off their production line and get a lioh that was much more humidity tolerant
the key here turned out to be not the chemical itself but its ability to produce good performance over a wide humidity range
so we were able to screen that and make that a viable non special production run lioh
the lithium hydroxide i said was an old solution
all previous spacecraft have been pretty short mission
and even the shuttle was a short mission
but the specification for shuttle said that it should have a capability of going twenty eight days and twenty eight days is not a short mission at least not in shuttle parlance
the engineering part of the organization said well why don't we go with a regenerative system
skylab had just been successfully flown with a regenerative system something that wouldn't have all this expendables because twenty eight days worth of lithium hydroxide for seven crewmen fills everything up with lithium hydroxide
there is no room for anything else
so we began to look at a regenerative system that could be used
actually it was proposed as part of the original shuttle development
but at that point the twenty eight day mission was considered a special case and the design case was the shorter missions
and in fact there were even projected to be a lot of short missions
the idea that the shuttle was a space truck
it would take stuff up dump it out and come home
and so the lithium hydroxide was a lighter system than a regenerative system
the lithium hydroxide was placed into the vehicle as a basic design
but when the space lab era came along we needed longer missions
we flew about four or five times in this thirteen to sixteen day range and those missions did require a lot of lithium hydroxide
and so it was proposed to use an absorbent that was regenerable and the one that was selected was a solid amine
the absorbent is a polymerized ethyleneimine
its designation is rnh and i don't really know why
the absorption actually comes in in two steps
first there is a reaction with water to create the freon
and then that is then reactive with the co two to give you another free ion but the co two is now captured
the desorption then with the heat and vacuum gives you back your original amine
so if you pack this in a bed and what we used was an expanded metal foam heat exchanger that you could fill all the holes with the solid amine and put the passages adjacent to each other so that you could use the heat of absorption to do your desorption on your other side
and all you would need to do is expose it to vacuum
it was a very simple system
it worked fine for the three or four missions
i'm not sure how many missions it was used
but it was an adjunct
it was added in put onto the floor and then it was taken back out when it was no longer needed because it was just wasted load
yes
for the lithium hydroxide the product lico three is that a solid form or a gas form
no it's a solid lithium carbonate
and that goes in the canisters that you remove
right
when you remove the canister it's a big lump
ok
finishing up the co two and trace removal we go to the trace removal and use the simple system of activated charcoal
and in fact it is packed into the same canister that the lithium hydroxide is packed into
it is a single use
there is a configuration i believe now operationally where the entire canister is activated charcoal so it can be used for cabin gas cleanup
so if you had an issue that you needed to clean the cabin up you could do that with a canister just of charcoal
the next area is the environmental cooling and humidity control
i mentioned on the schematic that we have a cabin heat exchanger
the front part of the heat exchanger basically is your reduced cabin gas temperature
the backend of the heat exchanger is where the condensing occurs because we get the gas below the dew point and therefore the water drops out
the heat exchanger has the characteristic that as the water collects at the outlet of the heat exchanger there were some holes drilled actually in the thin passages so the water can be sucked out
and it has the nickname slurper so it slurps the water out
it takes about two percents of the flow
so as the cabin fan produces the flow through the heat exchanger about two percents is siphoned off in the slurper
and that carries the water to the centripetal water gas separator
this is a device that basically spins the airstream
it's an airstream with water and trained
it spins the airstream
the water goes to the outside
it is collected in a trough and there is a pitot tube in the trough that the water impinges on and we get about a forty psi delta head with that
it's just a pump basically a pitot pump
the atmospheric circulation and ventilation is the next part of the system
as you know we're still in atmospheric revitalization
there are the redundant fans that i mentioned
each fan will do the job
there is also flight deck and mid deck duct system
it looks very complicated but there are only several points i want to make here
this is the atmospheric revitalization system i mentioned before
as you see it is below the floor
this is the mid deck here
this is the flight deck
so it's below the floor of the mid deck
the gas exits the heat exchanger
it goes up
there is some aft mid deck ventilation exhaust
it goes on up to the flight deck and exhausts on the flight deck
also there is a section that goes on the forward side of the cabin through the forward control console and blows in the face of the crew
the return is back through some avionic areas to provide cooling and then back down to the system
this is a complicated picture but really it is a very simple flow system
this becomes important later in our discussion because good mixing turned out to be a really important parameter
not just cooling
ok
the second
remember we had six
this is the second element
this is the atmospheric pressure and composition control
the first job is the fourteen point seven
the shuttle selected sea level the idea being we could not have a lot of special designed equipment
shuttle was intended to be a less expensive spacecraft than the previous ones
and so a sea level atmosphere gave us no questions about human survival and gave us a lot of opportunity for using more standard equipment and not specially designed equipment
there was a requirement though for a psia total control but this was only for an emergency de orbit
the problem statement is that you got a hole in your cabin
don't know how you got it but you have it
and the idea is the system has to be able to sustain the crew for a de orbit
and i don't know who made up the number but one hundred sixty nine minutes is the number
we have an emergency return one hundred sixty nine minutes
the system has to be able to accommodate that keeping the total pressure at or above eight psi
so there has to be enough flow capability enough consumables to do that
the half inch hole was a programmatic decision
i cannot speak for where the number exactly came from but it probably had to do with meteoroid debris kind of analysis that said what type of hole you could expect
anyway that was the design for the system
the next aspect or element of the system is the o two n two partial pressure control
at the total pressure of fourteen point seven we wanted sea level which is about three point two psi oxygen
at the eight psi we wanted it to be survivable but the oxygen could be less
obviously people live in denver so that works
there are also crew breathing masks which can be used in conjunction with low oxygen partial pressure
the cabin had to have both positive and negative relief
it had to store the oxygen and nitrogen and it had to provide pressurization for the water management system
remember earlier i talked about the more pervasive requirements
the water and waste management system now is placing requirements on the atmospheric pressure and composition control
this is a silhouette again where basically here you see the oxygen tank which is three thousand three hundred psi oxygen tank
there are nitrogen tanks on both sides
these are high pressure tanks all three thousand three hundred psi
the relief valves are shown here
and there is an o two n two supply panel which has all of the valves and regulators and everything on it
this system however though gets most of its oxygen from the cryogenic tanks
so that is only just shown as an inlet
these tanks are basically part of the power control system
electrical power is hydrogen and oxygen fuel cell
we use a lot less oxygen than they do so the storage was integrated
and then we use the oxygen for most of the uses
it comes from the main tanks
this is a schematic
i will start right there
this is the cryogenic system
this is the main cryogenic system
this is not part of the tankage of the pressure and composition control system
it goes through a restrictor
this is stored in a super critical state so the delivery is somewhat limited
and so this goes through a restrictor so that we don't decrease the pressure too fast in the cryogenic tank
it comes on down through a regulator that regulates down to one hundred psi
and that comes on down to two regulators
one is the normal regulator the fourteen point seven and the other is the eight psi regulator both of which are available depending on which cabin mode you're in
if you go over this way you will see the nitrogen
the nitrogen goes through its own regulator and it is regulated at two hundred psi
and that's important because that is contrasted to the one hundred here
next the nitrogen goes through an on off valve a solenoid that is connected to partial pressure sensors of oxygen
and if you're making up cabin gas you have to make a choice as to whether you want nitrogen or oxygen
and that choice is made by this system and a simple on off valve
there is no sophisticated control system
this is a simple on off valve
if the cabin needs pressure but doesn't need oxygen then this valve is open and the two hundred psi basically backs down the oxygen system
there is a check valve here no oxygen flow because you get nitrogen
at the point that you need oxygen this valve closes then there is no two hundred psi anymore
therefore the one hundred psi provides oxygen to the regulators
it is a very simple design
off the top of your head what kind of failures did you have during qual test that really bothered you
the regulators were produced by carlton and the regulators were derivatives of regulators they had been building for years
so the regulator functions really were pretty good
but the early problem we had was the pressure tolerance wandered and didn't have as good a pressure tolerance
and they did make some mods to correct that
but the more significant issues got into flow issues
their test capability was pretty limited
and when you're talking about very high flow cases you have to do something with the gas to make the regulator think that it is in an operational environment
and so we did a lot of testing and i will show you that in just a second for the high flow cases
let's see
there is a redundant system
it is not shown in this schematic but there are two of these just like this
this is the pressurization for the water and waste management system you see here
i would say there is a crossover to the redundant system so that you can do mix and match
if you have a problem in both systems you can mix and match the capabilities
also the oxygen system provides the emergency breathing system
it also provides oxygen to the air lock for recharge of the backpack
we will talk about that later
and i believe that's it
so for normal pressure we have fourteen point seven
and you have the automatic pressure regulator basically on off valve and the regulator
the partial pressure is controlled by the three point two psi which is the solenoid that controls that
it is a very simple system
the oxygen partial pressure does have another set point at the psia goes down to two point forty five psi
and i will show you that in a minute
for cabin pressure relief the problem statement really is why do you need relief
well what if one of those lines breaks
you've got three thousand three hundred psi tankage
it is all plumed together
the crew god forbid step on a line and break it and now you've got all this nitrogen rushing in
you don't want the cabin to explode right
so you need a relief valve
and the relief valve was set at sixteen point two
and again that is one of the high flow cases that we ended up testing
the system was designed with three relief valves
any tool will do the job
that is just a redundancy philosophy
sometimes you will see two items where either one does the job
in this case this is a very critical issue so there is a double redundancy here
for the negative pressure protection there is an eight psi delta relief valve
in fact there are three of those
you don't need the two to operate but there are three
this is for the return that i just showed you
if you come back with a hole in the cabin the cabin is at eight psi you cannot reverse flow through that hole
that is not going to work
you don't want the cabin imploding on the crew so you've got to make up as you come in the lower altitude obviously the higher pressure you've got to get that gas back in the cabin
so that's what that is for
ok
this is the other pressure vessel that was used as a test site
this was called the environmental test article
rockwell gave it that name
what they planned to do with this device when they built it was to do all the wiring runs and the plumbing runs in there
it was going to be a mockup
it turned out they built a rather beefy tank
in fact maybe they got one very inexpensively
i'm not sure how they ended up with it but they got it
they did do all the secondary structure so it had the right shape inside
and so it turned out they didn't end up using it
they went onto other methods
and so it ended up leftover in the program
we convinced aaron that he ought to give it to us and he did
this is what it looks like in cutaway
you see here all the secondary structure it was in boxes but we put it all in
foamed it in so that the volume was right so the cabin volume was essentially perfect
it had the flight deck
it had the mid deck
it had the lower deck for the environmental control system
but we also asked aaron to give us the cert hardware which he did
so we had the cert hardware underneath the floor
and the pressure control system we're talking about actually is on this back wall
that is a picture of it
what we did is faithfully run the lines
in fact we even use the same line material same fittings same everything
so we faithfully duplicated inside this test article the volume and the geometry and the system
all the ventilation ducts you saw all those were in place
we will come back to it later but you'll notice on the back wall of this test facility there is an airlock hatch
and later on i will tell you where that goes
but this is the control panel and the nitrogen oxygen system
this is test data
we did some testing to see how the system worked
this was testing of basically the on off oxygen control system
let me see if i can walk through this simply
we're working total pressure here oxygen partial pressure here
during this first interval the oxygen is on
what we're doing here is we're breathing it down
and when we hit the lower limit so that the regulator wants to do something then the oxygen partial pressure starts up because the regulator comes on
now the total pressure is maintained because that is what the regulator is supposed to do maintain total pressure
but as it maintains the total pressure it is doing it with oxygen and therefore the partial pressure is going up
when it is satisfied that is enough partial pressure of oxygen then the solenoid valve opens and you see the nitrogen come on
now you remember the nitrogen feed was at three hundred psi versus two hundred psi
so there is a little jump
that is just a mechanical artifact of the regulator
if you change the inlet pressure it regulates slightly differently because it is a balance system
you see a little jump there
and then during this period the pressure is maintained
but we're breathing off the oxygen because we've got the oxygen fenced off now
and then when the pressure is satisfied and the solenoid goes back the other way then we again start the oxygen again
so the system worked quite well
if you notice the tolerance band spec wise was pretty wide the system operated on a very narrow brand so we were very pleased with that
normally that is important
not only because it shows you that you do have a good sensitive system but you cannot mechanical hardware electrical hardware either one never operates down the middle always
there is drift
you need a little tolerance in your band here to have a decent system design
yes
does this change a lot when you have the crew performing high metabolic activity
the cabin is so large that it really doesn't know
the cycles would be different obviously because you consume more oxygen you would need more oxygen
so the on off cycle would favor longer oxygen cycles
but in the big picture there is really not a lot of change
what was this time period
it looks like this was about three hours maybe
that might go to two hours for a cycle
i mean not really very much
sorry
does microgravity have much effect on circulation
there is no circulation in microgravity
it just lays there
you push it or it doesn't go
diffusion is a driving force so if you're really really patient even at zero g you can wait but you cannot stay alive that way
but yes you do have to have ventilation
still in the atmospheric pressure and composition control
this is the emergency breathing equipment
we used plug in face masks
there are some uses for the mask that require a carry on bottle to give portability but the vehicle does have plug in capability
the masks were purge type masks
you're probably not familiar much with masks but there is a mask called a rebreather which basically your lung power does all the work and you only purge enough to keep the co two down and you keep rebreathing
and then the purge type is every breath is a fresh breath and you then exhale and the gas goes out in the cabin
and that's the type that this is because the cabin needs the oxygen
i mean it's not going anywhere bad
it is ok that it's not completely spent
it's good
that's like a scuba mask right
i don't scuba
sorry
but i think the answer is yes
with scuba you take in the air and then you blow it all out
i mean there are scuba rebreathing systems but the typical scuba gear is not
rather than raising your hand if you make a noise of some kind
sorry
i don't mean to ignore you
the mask can be used in a contaminated environment and the mask can be used if the concentration of o two is low to give you a better oxygen level
this is the psia test that we did
actually a series of tests
but this is data from one
as you see we started up in the fourteen point seven range
we simulated the hole
the pressure immediately starts down
the partial pressure of oxygen we let degrade to about the two point two range
this is a different set point
remember i told you on the oxygen sensors we have two set points
this is the second set point
and so we have the lower oxygen partial pressure
the system came down
the psia regulator which is always online captured the pressure decay caught it and the solenoid valve popped back and forth to keep the oxygen ok because we're losing now
we're going out this half inch hole
and the system worked just fine
this did have the crew on the masks because that is livable you can live there but the mask is a better environment
this is a mask case
this was a requirement that came on later
the design is the design now
the vehicle exists so we have to now operate the vehicle with accommodations for operationally what we want to do with it
and a new requirement developed and was imposed on the vehicle
and that requirement had to do with the space suit for the eva operation
the shuttle spacesuits are basically one hundred percents o two
and the classical way of going eva from a sea level environment was a four hour prebreathe
actually as much as six hours depending on how conservative the medics were at the time that number varied around some to prevent bends
but it was determined that if you accommodized at nine psi for about twelve hours then you only required a really short prebreathe
and the suit up time which gave you thirty to forty minutes actually gave you sort of a free tune up to your prebreathe as part of your suit up operation
and so that was viewed as a much better way to do evas than the previous way
the masks are useful but are not very comfortable
so if you have to keep them on for a long period of time they're not very comfortable at all
also the medics were very concerned about mask leakage that if there was any nitrogen inflow that that could break the prebreathe
but our system isn't designed for nine
we have a fourteen point seven and an eight but we don't have a nine so we needed a manual procedure
but before that could be accepted there were some issues that had to be evaluated
and we had to do testing on each of these issues
the first is the flow rate acceptability at nine psi
obviously the less dense gas you're not going to get the same mask flow rate
and we had to make sure that that ventilation was going to be adequate
and testing proved that it was
the next is a thermal acceptability
there are really two aspects to this
one is the fan itself is cooled by the environment so if the environment doesn't provide as much cooling to fan itself it could overheat
also the electronic equipment some of which is air cooled the less dense gas could be a problem there
it turned out that could be controlled with load control
that could off load power and make that acceptable
the co two performance at nine psi we needed to make sure that was ok
it turned out that of course the nine psi case we don't care about the lithium hydroxide
the purge flow is so great there is no co two problem
but at nine psi for twelve hours you have to get performance out of the lithium hydroxide
so we checked that and that worked out fine
and the last item was the ventilation adequacy
we do have a press and depress
you've got to come down to nine and you've got to go back
and both of those adjust the gas mixture
and so we wanted to prove that that was ok
and so we went to the facility that we were talking about and ran this profile
now this profile was created by our yes
well that's what i just said
yes it does
the air cooled equipment is going to run hot
if you want to cool that equipment it will become a little clearer later but the equipment is in equipment bays
and so with the less dense gas you need to have some of that equipment turned off so that the cooling that is available is adequate
so you do load control get rid of some of the electronics
and therefore the air that's left the atmosphere that is left can cool the equipment
and then when do you increase the pressure back to normal after the eva
after the twelve hours
no actually it's before the eva
well i'm not sure what they do now
when you're all finished with your evas then you bring the cabin back
because typically you do multiple evas
and so from one day to the next you just keep the cabin at actually we use ten point two now rather than nine but i think you have to certify it for nine right
this was an early certification for nine
yes
but wouldn't it have been easier to simply design the whole system for nine from the beginning if you had
well this was not a shuttle requirement
this was an operational requirement that occurred after the shuttle specifications were set
you're correct
if we knew it ahead of time it would have been much easier to do it all for nine psis exactly
it would have just been a third condition
but as jeff pointed out we changed our mind
the first was nine and now we're at ten point two so we're not consistent
as we learn we change our mind
and the ten point two was selected later
our mission operations people that do the crew time lining and all they created this procedure
and so we tested it
this has a simple depress cycle
you come from fourteen point seven
you hesitate at about eleven and replenish the oxygen
you do that twice
you then do manual control down at the nine psi level
you notice the oxygen partial pressure here is always maintained by these adjustments and also during the manual period you select what you want
and then when you come back the procedure was to increase the nitrogen and then finish the top off with oxygen
that was thought to be completely acceptable because the oxygen level at this point is completely viable
and so doing the nitrogen first and topping it off with oxygen was thought to be an acceptable way to operate
so we did the test and this is what happened
we were all nice and comfortable with our oxygen partial pressure
and you see the area next to where we were repressing
we depleted the oxygen substantially
and the mid deck and even the flight deck we depleted the oxygen
and i've only shown you half the data
if you look at the rest of the data you see where the oxygen went
these equipment bays that i mentioned earlier the avionics bays and other equipment bays are basically isolated volumes from the cabin
so as the pressure comes up what you're doing is you're pressurizing these areas with cabin gas which is oxygen and nitrogen you're pressurizing these areas with nitrogen only
basically you are depleting the partial pressure here
you're increasing the partial pressure here
you remember partial pressure
you just count the molecules
that's all you have to do
basically we're putting more oxygen molecules here and we're taking them out of these areas
and therefore they are going down
this is just a picture of one of the bays
you see all the empty space around the equipment
that is where the gas is
we came up with an alternate procedure which is to simultaneously put the oxygen and nitrogen in together
and of course there is the nine back to fourteen point seven
and you notice that solved the problem
there is still some dip at the supply area because the mixture is lean
we need from nine to fourteen point seven five point seven psi total pressure increase
but we only need two point five up to three point two oxygen
this is a mixture but it's a lean mixture
so there is still some slight loss but the only area that came under an issue is near the inlet where the o two n two supply panel is
and of course you can just avoid that area
well i should say that that area happens to be right around the bathroom
and so before we repressurized the shuttle the commander would say anybody who has to use the bathroom use it now because for about ten fifteen minutes while we're depressurizing it's off limits
ok
next item
this is the water and waste management area
this is one of the six items
we have potable and waste water inventory management
we're continually producing potable water as you know and waste water
we have to dump them we have to use them so that is part of the requirement of this system
we have to store water for drinking food prep and waste water storage
it has to be dumped to space
commode and urinal for human waste collection
and we provide water for an evaporative heat sink which we will talk about later called the flash evaporator
yes
this is an outstanding example of systems engineers this total system that walt is talking about
we can really see the interaction between all the systems and the spacecraft
this really is a systems engineering problem
potable water we take all the fuel cell byproduct water and use it
so it is basically in a fluent to the power system
we do have a launch storage capability for water and we do provide sterilization
the sterilization is iodine
we started out designing a silver ion system
it turned out that we had manufacturing problems and the company ended up going out of business so we reverted to iodine
the lunar module used iodine
waste water the condensate from the cabin humidity control and urine and the urine pretreat
urine has to be pretreated to bind the urea
if you don't you get a lot of ammonia
it uses a chemical called oxzone
it's an acid
i'm not really sure what it is
this is where the system is located
this is one of the simpler schematics
the water tanks are here
the water comes from the fuel cell
as i said by the way the delivery is about one hundred fifty degrees and sixty psi
so there is a lot of hydrogen dissolved in the water
the water is collected in the fuel cells on the hydrogen side so there is a lot of hydrogen
there is a hydrogen separator here
otherwise your tanks would end up full of hydrogen which is what you don't want
you will get water in the tanks
the hydrogen separator is a silver palladium metal
it is catalyzed
it is basically porous to hydrogen but not to water
if you expose the backside to the vacuum it pulls the hydrogen off and the water goes through just fine
i will say that there still is a rather high gas content in the water that you drink
and that gas of course evolves once it gets inside your stomach with predictable results
yes
in fact all sorts of systems that jeff could explain
they have slinger systems and all sorts of systems to get separation because it is not really possible to get all the gas out of the water
ok
there is a dump system
there is a potable waste dump to vacuum
there is also a vacuum vent which i will show you what that is all about
and then the flash evaporator that i mentioned and i will mention more later is in the back of the vehicle and it has a redundant water feed system both sides
this is a schematic
start at the same place
water from the fuel cells goes through the hydrogen separator and then into this bank of tanks
the tanks are pressurized
they are yellow bellows tanks
on the back side of the bellows is nitrogen
on the forward side of course is the potable water
there is a hydrophobic filter on the downside of each tank
if a bellows were to leak you don't want water into your nitrogen system
so this is a filter to prevent that
i mentioned the twin flash evaporator feeds
there they are
this is the dump nozzle here
the potable water system provides water to the crew so there is a regular water interface and a chilled water interface here
i believe that is it
i remember there were more problems with apollo than there were with shuttle forty nine point thirty i don't have those sorted mentally
i'm sorry
i don't remember
i'm not sure
maybe that was on apollo
basically that means you put your water into a plastic bag
and now you can actually swing it around like so
and so the water will go to the outside and the gas is in the inside
so that actually separates them and you can squeeze the gas out through a valve
on orbit trash storage there is an overboard bleed for odor control
it's a very small overboard bleed to vacuum
and the human solid waste collection and storage is also vacuum dried and stabilized
this is a waste management picture
the subject we were just talking about is the vacuum vent
that vacuum vent does vent the commode area where the feces are
that vent also provides a vent for the water separator
it also provides a vent for airlock depress for eva
so this is the vacuum system
the urine is collected and trained in a liquid
well let me say that different
the urine after it has been separated from the gas stream is stored in a waste tank as is the humidity from the cabin atmospheric revitalization system
and then that is pressurized from the pressured composition control system and is dumped overboard
this waster is not used for anything
it is basically dumped just to do inventory management
the next picture explains a little better about the commode and the urinals themselves
the urinal originally had a unisex interface cup
it turned out that didn't work very well and so later flights there was a custom male female
and later there were even some more customizing for the crew i believe but i don't have the details on that
the urinal itself obviously for urination there needs to be some way to make the urine go where you want it to go
and those were done in fan separators
so there is gas pulled in the cup
and in training the urine the urine then comes down and goes through the separators
this is also a centrifugal type separator
and then that is sent to the head that is created here
then puts that waste water urine in the waste system
the emu spacesuit it also has a condensate drain after each eva and it also goes through this same system and into the waste tank
the commode
basically there is a seat
the seat has a small opening
the commode itself is basically a cylinder or a tub
and there is a slinger in the bottom
so the slinger basically distributes the paper and the fecal matter on the outside wall in a thin layer
the vacuum then can dry that so that it deactivates it so it does not end up either any odor or creating any kind of bacteriological issues
but the entrainment of the fecal material so that it in fact hits the slinger is done with an air flow
the air flow comes in around the seat itself
that requires good contact with the seat
it also requires positioning
positioning turned out to be an early issue or reliable positioning and so a trainer was put together that had a camera here
and the trainer i might add was discretely located in a non observable place so that it could be used in privacy the comings and goings and also the use of the facility itself
and they told us it was not hooked up to a tape recorder
just to elaborate on that
basically the problem is it really is a rather small opening
and it just doesn't feel natural to know where to put yourself down
and it actually did lead to significant messes on orbit
i won't go into any more detail
but the idea is that you would position yourself the way you thought it should be and then you would turn on the lights
and there is a tv screen in front of you
i'm not making this up
so that you could see how close you are to the bull's eye
enough said
the cabin thermal control is another one of the subsystem elements
it is a circulating liquid cooling system
it provides the heat sink for the atmosphere itself
it also provides the ability to reject that heat to the spacecraft cooling system because you've got to get rid of it out of the cabin
it has some avionics cold plates some air cool avionics support the crew in the airlock and a portable water chiller
this is the location
you will notice the avionics bays are listed here with their little circulation systems
the liquid system then services each of those the chill or the condensing heat exchanger
and this is the place that the cabin system connects to the spacecraft system on the aft bulkhead right here
we will see the other half of this system in a little bit
this is a schematic that is very complicated looking but it is fairly simple
let me show you the air piece first
look at the black lines
those are twin fans
it goes through the air cooled avionics through the heat exchanger to get rid of the heat
there are some cold plated avionics in each bay so you take care of the cold plated and the air cooled in this bay and in this bay and in this bay
now you've got all of the electronics taken care of
i should have started this up at the pump
sorry about that
here is the pump and we will come down
it also takes care of the forward and overhead window mounts around the window for thermal control
and the hatch is just a way to keep those thermally stabilized
back in the early flights we had something called dfi development flight instrumentation
it was a special instrumentation package
it was also liquid cooled
and then this is the heat exchanger to the spacecraft system
it is a freon system
this is where the main heat is rejected right here
on the other side of this you've got cool liquid
it turns out this is water
we go through the liquid cooling garment which is the spacesuit cooling garment the water chiller go through the cabin heat exchanger to cool the cabin and condense the water out and then back to the pump
i failed to mention the imu
it has triply redundant fans
it pulls air through it
and that is also cooled by this gas stream
anyway this is the cabin thermal control system
these functions i just said each one of them so i won't repeat them
cabins circulating liquid cooling loop
as i mentioned water is the coolant
water is actually a very good coolant
and if you have any requirements that push you that way in your designing thermal control systems you like water
water is completely nontoxic so it can be around the crew
leaks don't make any difference
it has a very high cp
it's a really good fluid
the problem with water is freezing
you don't want to freeze it and you don't want to get it so hot that it turns into steam
but if you can stay within the boundaries it is a good fluid
and that is what this is
redundant pumps i showed you that on the schematic
the liquid gas heat exchanger i showed you that before
cold plates for electronic cooling and the window hatch mount
the circulating gases that i mentioned for the avionics the cabin gas was used as a coolant
you saw the redundant fans and the doubly redundant fans
i mentioned earlier and someone commented on it that the promise early on was the shuttle could be a less expensive development activity if we used off the shelf avionics the kind that aircraft use
and that's a good promise
it turned out that that's not a very good not as good a solution for thermal control as liquid cooled
liquid cooled is a much more efficient way of providing a heat sink to electrical equipment
when you blow the cabin gas through it then you end up with the problems of if you change the pressure in the cabin which we talked about
that can effect cooling
also you have to put out a lot more power
you have to blow a lot more gas than you do power to move the liquid around so it's not a very good thermal solution
and actually the promise of less expensive avionics i don't think was actually fulfilled
although that's somebody else's topic and not mine because i think everything was pretty well custom
it did potentially complicate the thermal control system for a good goal
and how well that goal was met somebody else will have to speak for it
another one of the subsystem elements of the spacecraft
well we usually take a two minute break when we're about halfway through
certainly
why don't we take our two minutes now and then we will pick it right back up
from an engineering standpoint it is much better to cool with liquid
if you use cold plates it is much more efficient
you get a good reliable heat sink
and you can then design your thermal conduction paths so that out of the avionics box you make sure the heat goes to the cold plate
and you use a lot less power
you can pump water a lot more efficiently for the cooling capability than you pump gas
is that what happens on the shuttle now or do you have a mixture
this is the air cooled part of the loop and here are the cold plates
let's get the class back
thank you very much
i am sorry
did you see what i was pointing at here
yeah you put both
yeah and this is one bay
and they have both cold plates and the air cooled here here and here
there they are
of course when you go outside the vehicle there is no more air so all the external equipment is cold plated
was there another question
what kind of design changes would you have to make in order to go strictly to completely liquid cooled electronics
well if you're trying to use off the shelf and it is air cooled already there is a cabinet right there full of it
if it is air cooled already then you have to stay with that concept
if you're custom designing then from the very beginning you say i'm custom designing this to be liquid cooled
and then the internal design is such that there are conduction pads to the base plate so that it can be cooled
ok
i guess previously to that all of our spacecraft were liquid cooled
apollo was wasn't it
yes
because you had to be able to take those spacecraft down the back
right
we evacuated the cabin both in the command module and the lunar module
and gemini too
this is the spacecraft active thermal control system
this is the vehicle level
so now even though we're still under this etclss we are not talking the classical environmental control anymore
this is a bigger picture
also the reason the word active is stuck in here was a left over from previous programs too
for example on apollo we had several heat rejection systems
not a single one
and we also did a lot of passive thermal control on apollo
we had a mission mode called barbeque which is basically you roll the vehicle very slowly so you normalize the environment
if you leave the same side toward the sun all the way to the moon that side gets really hot
this is the active system to get away from heaters and or vehicle level control
there is an on orbit
we have a radiative heat sink
we also have an evaporative heat sink on orbit
during ascent and entry we have two heat sinks both of which are evaporative
we have a circulating liquid system
we take heat from the cabin from the fuel cells hydraulics all the cold plate avionics and electronics and payloads we do cooling for payloads
all of these are the functions of the active thermal control system
this as you notice is a lot busier than some of the others have been
you will notice the radiators here on the side wall
this is the doors
when closed up there are no radiators
when opened the underside of the payload doors are your radiators
and this is on both side obviously
that same heat exchanger that i showed you before that interfaces with the cabin is right here
the cabin load is dumped there
fuel cell load is dumped here
the fluid is a freon twenty one
there is a freon twenty one pump package
the payload heat exchanger is here i believe
mid body cold plates
aft cold plates
each radiator side has its own flow control system
the evaporative heat sinks one is the flash evaporator that i've shown you a couple times before
i will describe it a little better in the minute
it is here
it uses water
there is an ammonia boiler here that is also an evaporative heat sink
and when we're on the ground there is a gse connector for the gse heat sink
more than you would ever know
in fact this is the most complicated integrated thermal test ever run at jsc
and i will show you a picture of it in a minute
we actually tested all of that together
and it all had to work together
and it gets worse as we go along
i will show you all the integration factors as we go along but it changes from mission mode to mission mode
it changes within mission modes as to how the system works
and i will try to describe that
ok so this sort of gives you the feel now
keep in mind geometry is going to play an effect here as to how you plum the system up
so freon is running through all of those lines there to the radiators
it will be a little clearer in a minute
this is a schematic
let's start at the radiators
on a good day this is doing the job for you
all the radiators are getting you nice cool liquid
the radiator uses a bypass system so you will see the bypass around the radiators
it is good to remind yourselves that heat load can be tremendously different
and the high level mission phases a lot of electronics a lot of crew activity the vehicle is alive and pumping out the power and therefore pumping out the heat
if you ever did one of those twenty eight day missions we talked about which was a spec requirement you can imagine this vehicle is almost quiescent
it is doing very little
you're trying to link them the mission
so you're doing hopefully experiments or something in spacelab
you're doing something else
the vehicle is not working for you very hard
just as an example we have five computers
and we use all five during ascent and entry the active phases for safety but once you're on orbit when you have a long mission like that you actually power down all but two of the computers
that is just it
and there are a lot of other systems which you power down
and that way you're limited in missions by the electrical energy which is limited by the amount of hydrogen and oxygen you can carry for fuel cells
so by powering down you extend your mission
and of course you will also reduce the heat load
and when you reduce the heat load you've got to find some way to make that same radiator work for you at a very low heat load
so it has the capability of getting rid of a lot of heat
if you don't want it to get rid of that much heat because you don't have it then you have to go to bypass system
anyway the next thing in the loop is the gse heat exchanger
on the ground you don't have radiators working so you use the gse heat exchanger
then there is the ammonia boiler
when you reenter the ammonia boiler gives you the ability to operate with an evaporative heat sink prior to the connection of the gse and so it is part of the thermal control system
the next is the flash evaporator
and you'll notice there are two flash chambers here
one is called the high load and one is called the topper
and i will talk about that a little more later
then the nice cool liquid however it was cooled all these cool it
however it was cooled is then available for the vehicle
and there is one more little heat load and that is the cryogenic oxygen that we're bringing in
we also warm it up with this coolant loop
so the flow then goes to the aft cold plates
and then the flow also goes to the cabin heat exchanger and the payload heat exchanger
you notice these are either or
and that's because sometimes you don't even have a payload heat exchanger use so you don't use it
sometimes you have a lot of use for it
and maybe for example spacelab and space station have kind of an arrangement
you wouldn't be in the cabin as much so you can divert that
it allows you to use the capacity in either of two places here
then you come on down and come through your pumping package there are redundant pumps
then you go the fuel cell heat exchanger because now you've used the nice cold fluid up
and so the fuel cell can stand the warmer temperatures
also some cold plates
now it might have occurred to you it occurred to me why did we waste our nice cold fluid on these cold plates
why didn't we put those cold plates down here so we could have had more cold fluid for our cabin heat exchangers
and the answer is geometry
those are way in the back
the cabin is in the front
after you've come forward from the flash evaporator which is in the back to the cabin you don't want to go back to pick this up
you wouldn't want to have to go back to the back of the vehicle and then back forward again so this is a geometry problem
we have cold plates here
we also have cold plates here
they come forward
the hydraulics heat exchanger is the last thing on the loop and then back to the radiators
we will talk about that a little more
the functions of the active thermal control system
collect the waste energy from all the systems
we just talked about that
and rejected radiatively to space
that is our first choice
our first choice is to use the radiators
it turns out that the radiators in some heat load environments don't do the job
you have a high load and a bad environment you cannot get rid of all the heat
also we are producing a lot of water so something constructive has to be done with this water
the fuel cells are pumping it out because every time you make a kilowatt you've got more water to use
so we decided to augment the space radiators with the evaporative heat sink at these high load cases
this gives us an ability to accept a radiator system that cannot really do the job by itself but make it completely adequate for some of the low heat load cases but in the high heat load cases then it is augmented by water
now when you want to get rid of water and you don't have some of this bad environment you can actually throttle the radiators down
and if you throttle them down then you force the evaporative heat sink to come online and do the job for you
in other words you change the set point on the radiator
normally we use forty degrees set point
if you change it to fifty six degrees and let the water take you from fifty six back down to forty then you artificially get rid of water
it is a good water dump system
during ascent over one hundred thousand feet we use the water boiler
the flash evaporator
not a water boiler
that's a freudian slip i guess
the apollo had what's called a water boiler
it was a nightmare
we said never will we do that again so we ended up with a different design for the shuttle
the reentry system below one hundred thousand feet is ammonia
it will carry you all the way to the ground and on the ground until you get the gse
water won't carry you because water won't evaporate less than one hundred thousand feet but the ammonia will so that's the reason it is there
let's talk about the radiators themselves
the two payload bay doors are a mirror image of each other
they are radiators on each side that are exactly mirror image
i don't know what happened there
anyway this is supposed to say that the radiators on these two sides are mounted and are plumbed in two separate cooling loops
the reason for that is there is always a redundant loop
obviously you have to be able to take a failure and still have a good system
if you run both loops through both radiator sides and you took some sort of collision hit then you could wipe out both of your cooling loops in one hit
and so that is unacceptable
by plumbing the systems up with mirror image radiator systems on different loops then you can still use the capacity together
but if you lose one side you still have half your capacity left
and plus you have your evaporative heat sinks to make up the difference
so we can survive with a door out
i mentioned the dual set points before
i also mentioned the bypass thermal control
i mentioned the dual set points forty and fifty six point forty is our normal
if you're trying to burn up some water you go to fifty six and you use the difference in water
the radiators we have two different kinds of radiators
we have the single sided that are on the back of the vehicle and some two sided ones on the front of the vehicle
the reason for that is when you open the door you expose the underside of the door
if you have radiators on the underside of the door then you've exposed your radiators
but if you lift the radiator panel off the door because the doors go way down then you can see the underside
it's not as good you don't get a full view of the heavens but it does get rid of heat
and so we needed that extra capacity
on the front four panels they are the two sided and on the back four they are single sided
the radiators themselves are made out of a honeycomb aluminum structure
the tubes were imbedded in the structure so that the surface was smooth and that was because we wanted to use a silver teflon tape for our thermal control coding
for previous vehicles we always painted the radiators painted them white
if you look at the alpha epsilon white paint it is pretty good
i think apollo was zero point eighteen alpha and epsilon about zero point ninety two
that's pretty good
the market had moved along
technology had advanced and there was not the silver teflon out there
and what the silver teflon does is the silver gives you the reflection which is good and the teflon gives you the radiation which is good so you get the best of both worlds
silver teflon was about zero point five epsilon and about zero point eighty eight zero point nine something like that
you lost a slight amount in epsilon and gained a lot in alpha so basically you could ignore the sun which is what you'd like to do is ignore the sun
it turned out the silver teflon had some issues
we tested the radiators
the radiator was not a slam dunk with eight panels four of which are two sided
effectively you have twelve panels
you have fluid going through those in parallel tubes
you're trying to guaranty that the fluid all goes where it's supposed to go
and therefore the viscosity of freon which is very low analytically said it was all right
but we wanted some testing to prove it so we did test the entire radiator system
and in that test all the silver teflon fell off
it is a really good thermal coating but it doesn't seem to be very practical
it turned out that the problem was adhesive
we did a little adhesive work and the materials people came up with a permacel that worked perfectly
they have never come off again
in fact we get ten point twelve years out of the radiators lots of time
the problem that the permacel couldn't solve was beneath the tape you could get very small little out gassing of the materials
almost all materials outgas some
basically we would put bubbles underneath the tape
we went to a perforated
there are millions of little holes in this tape
and it is placed on the vehicle and it stayed on just fine
it wasn't very long though that people began to worry about the focusing of this silver that the doors are curved upward
and so there is a focal point there that is a very very hot point
and there was concern that that's really not a good thing to have
if we could make the surface less specular and more diffuse without losing the alpha and epsilon we would have a better design
and so they dimpled it
now we have permacel dimpled perforated silver teflon tape
it works great
the flash evaporator
water is the flash evaporator's evaporant
this was a brand new design
the water boiler on apollo was no good
it was a problem
the flash evaporator is a very simple concept
you have a chamber
you run your coolant around the chamber that you want to be cooled
and you spray water on the walls of the chamber
and if the pressures are all right the water will flash
you won't get ice
it will go straight to steam
steam will go overboard and it will all be wonderful
and if you can convince a program manager of that good luck
anyway the way to convince a program manager is to show him good test data
during the development we developed this process of spraying the walls and not getting water carryover which will obviously freeze up your steam duct
which you don't want
but as the design evolved we had to get more sophisticated because we needed this flash evaporator to burn up the extra water when we didn't need the fuel cell water
and we did that with that forty to fifty six set point
and so we needed a small evaporator that could handle that
it was called the topper it tops off the radiator
but when the doors are closed there is nothing else to get rid of your heat now you need a loss of capacity
and so the second chamber was the hallowed chamber
together they do the whole job
when the radiators are working only topper you can come home with this system functional and make it home
it turns out we never did freeze up the steam duct so that part was good
it turns out that we had some freezing in the chamber
and in fact we had to develop a process that acknowledged that that could occur
and how would we flush it
it is called flushing and so we did develop a process
and it has never failed
the flushing process always works
and we have had on several occasions i probably cannot count them for you but four of five times maybe over the shuttle flights we've had some freezing inside the cavities
there is a non propulsive overboard vent
that was the one going out both sides for the topper because it could be used for very long times during the mission and you might be pointing or whatever you might be doing
but when you're coming home the high load is just a big out the side of the vehicle type duct
the ammonia boiler its heat sink is ammonia
as i mentioned before it evaporates all the way to the ground where the water won't
the redundant boiler is here
up here there are no redundant boilers
these two chambers have redundant everything
they have redundant feed water systems and redundant control systems redundant spray nozzles redundant everything but the chamber is a chamber
you get what you get
they are redundant boilers is the way the ammonia boiler gets its redundancy
it was designed to be utilized during entry and on the runway until the cooling is available
it turns out that we don't do that anymore
it turns out operationally we learned that if we cold soak the radiators before we shut the doors and then bypass them and come home on the flash evaporator that there is a lot of heat capacity still left in those radiators
there is a lot of fluid out there and it is cold
and so we can actually go all the way to wheel stop on the radiator
and so at one hundred seventy five thousand feet we start flowing the radiator
and at one hundred thousand feet the flash evaporator is off and we cold soak all the way home
and after wheel stop the ammonia boiler cranks up
i mentioned the freon twenty one the low viscosity
we got an excellent performance out of that
the low viscosity is really really important as much parallelism as we have
i didn't really give you the numbers
in the single panels we have twenty six tubes
in the two sided panels i believe there are sixty six tubes
lots of tubes
lots of parallelism
it is awfully easy to get flow instability in a thermal system like that but the freon loop does great
we have redundant pumps all liquid heat exchangers and cold plates
this is that chamber that i told you
if you can look right down here this is one person
in fact there is a radiator panel
this was during buildup
twice we tested the flash evaporator in this environment once as part of the integrated system with all the radiators and once by itself
and twice we tested the radiators one as part of the integrated system and once by themselves
so we did essentially three large tests
and the one that had the entire system in it had all the cold plates had everything in it as i said is the most sophisticated thermal test we've ever done at jsc
and it proved that the system could work
it also proved that we had to tune the flash evaporator nozzle because it was wrong
but we did get the data we did prove it was wrong and we got it re machined
a machine out of columbium somebody else will have to answer why
and so it was a problem for aaron to go get us another one but it fixed it and it was successful
you can have a command module and a service module and a stack configuration in side that chamber
and it had a solar and full vacuum
it was a manned chamber then
it is not now
after apollo soyuz it hasn't been manned since then
it's still available for testing but is not manned
it has a sister chamber one hundred feet that way where all of the eva testing is done
a good example i think of how the shuttle program built on a lot of apollo the same thing at the cape where a lot of the launch hardware was adapted is the shuttle program you know you heard about the budgetary constraints
the shuttle program never could have afforded to build something like that
but luckily a lot of this equipment was built during apollo when the money was much more available
if you have been keeping count we're getting toward the end here
i did want to mention before we left the main orbiter systems that there was some rotating equipment life testing that we did for the program
the equipment we're talking about here is the cabin fan the water gas separators the avionics bay fans cabin coolant and the vehicle coolant pumps
the life requirement was one hundred missions and that was calculated by somebody to be twenty thousand hours
if you could show twenty thousand hours of successful operation you had the design life of the hardware
we set up a laboratory to run the equipment
it was obviously a low maintenance lab
we collected data and checked in the room occasionally to see if everything was all right
it turned out that all the equipment passed the twenty thousand hour requirement
we did learn something though that some of that stuff was so noisy
oh it was noisy
there was some work done on some muffling but the hardware itself was all good
we are at the end
yes
were there noise requirements
yes there was a cabin noise spec
and yes it had to be met
and i don't remember how it was met
we put mufflers on some of the equipment
maybe some insulation inside of the ducting i'm not sure
if we have time i will tell a little anecdote here
i chaired the change control board
the medical organization came to see me and said that the cabin was very very noisy and it was going to really do a detriment to the astronauts
and it was very expensive in terms of dollars and weight to really get all the cabin fans and cabin environment down to the level they wanted
i thought for a moment
i go out to california a lot
i go out to rockwell and stay in motels that are on the los angeles freeway
and i said you don't see me worried about my ears in staying in those freeways and not being able to sleep and having all that noise
and the doctor looked at me for a moment and said well you're already deaf
and i said what did you say
but we did have to make some modifications of it to actually reduce noise
let me interject one item
i think somebody asked the issue about the imu
we decided to pick the imu off the shelves and it was air cooled to really do it right
if we would have done it right we would have picked an imu which was compatible with liquid cooling rather than redesign it
but we decided to stick with the imu that was air cooled
whether that was the right decision to make i don't know
it seemed like it was because i think we've only had one problem with an imu
i don't think we've had many problems with the imu
but that is a little anecdote that i thought of
that's a program manager's trait
probably the air cooled imu was a less expensive option
it might have cost a little in terms of thermal efficiency but that is only energy power
and power was available so it was a good tradeoff
this is the last of the subsystem areas
this is the eva airlock support
the environmental thermal control and life support system does support the airlock
it maintains the cabin pressure and composition during the airlock repress and depress
this is really a requirement back on the ars and the pressure and composition control system because airlock use basically dumps cabin gas and then you repress the airlock
it is a requirement that you cannot upset the cabin while you're doing the eva function
we also provide the service and cooling umbilical
if you have any kind of mental picture of being in the airlock the crew is connected with cooling and oxygen through an umbilical so they don't use the consumables in their spacesuit
and so that is provided by the etclss
heat rejection the crew wears a liquid cooling garment
and the cooling for that is done by the vehicle until you go eva of course
then the recharge
we supply the backpack o two recharge from the nine hundred psi cryo
we supply the water to recharge for the sublimator
nasa is overrun with acronyms
emu is extra vehicular mobility unit which means nothing but spacesuit and backpack
so the spacesuit and backpack uses an evaporative heat sink and it uses a sublimator
and the idea there is it's a device that exposes a layer of ice to space and then it sublimates and you get your cooling from that as opposed to putting a liquid water on a surface and flashing it
anyway that has to be serviced
that water is provided from the system
and then the condensate that the crew brings back eva that's a sweaty job
that condensate goes back into the system
so the airlock support is another part of this system
in fact that is the sixth part
so we are through
this is a picture of the airlock
not really the airlock
this is the test chamber that we built to put the equipment in
you'll notice it has the right hatch in it
and if you can recall back an hour and a half ago i showed you a picture where there was this hatch basically on the backside of the test chamber
we hook those together
because as i said as you depress and repress the airlock it affects the cabin
so we needed a test environment that had both those simultaneously
but the difference is this has to go all the way to vacuum
so we connected this to our vacuum system
and when the crew is inside this it is a manned vacuum test
and when the crew is inside the other test chamber it is basically sea level or at most eight psi would be the lowest it would ever be
and i think the last picture is a spacesuit inside the airlock
and this is just a little cutaway showing the airlock
this was mounted on the back of that chamber you saw earlier
if you bring that picture back up i will talk to that for just a minute and then we will have some questions
before every flight one of the things that we do is that every eva crewmember takes his or her spacesuit into that eva test chamber into the airlock test chamber so you actually get a chance to take your own suit down to vacuum
and particularly before you do your very first eva it is really a confidence builder because the physical sensations that you get in a suit and remember you're at about a four psi pure oxygen environment
your body the inside of your mouth feels a little different
there are funny sounds with the fans inside the suit
the sorts of things that you don't want to experience the first time when you actually go outside into space
it is much better to do it here in a controlled environment where if there is a problem actually you are supported because of the weight of the suit
it doesn't look like there is anybody in this suit
but when you're in this suit you're actually supported by a cable to the ceiling of the chamber which is on quick release bolts
you're suspended up here
and if you ever have a problem they can release this repressurize the chamber within about thirty seconds
i think that's the limit for a manned rated chamber
you're going to be able to repress in about thirty seconds and then just lift you out suit and all from the top and get you out of your suit and get you to the medics
this is just an inverted bell jar
the hatch is not sealed
when you depress it just like pulls it out and seals due to the pressure difference
you just lift the top off
yet another example of the extensive testing that we go through before every mission
i might add one more thing which i forgot actually to add earlier
the manned rating is a term used in manned spacecraft which means that you've specifically tested it and said that its design is worthy of supporting a human
the airlock had to provide that function
so aaron was faced with man rating the airlock
and manned test capability is very scarce
in fact jsc may be the only place anymore that can do it
anyway we volunteered to do that as part of our test program as a programmatic requirement
not as testing or watching or confirming anything but as a prime part of the test program was the manned rating of the airlock
and that was done in houston
that is an interesting thought
if my memory serves me correctly one of the problems we had in the early part of the manned space program was doing some chamber runs mcdonnell douglas with a two gas system where we actually lost the heat in the chamber and almost lost a test subject
and that was when apollo decided to go to one hundred percents oxygen
and that is what led up to the fire on the pad
it went to one hundred percents oxygen at sixteen pounds per square inch with an invert over the hatch for another reason
and that is really if you can realize that one hundred percents oxygen at sixteen psi everything burns
stainless steel is not self extinguishing at sixteen psi
and of course that's what we were up when we had the apollo i fire on the pad
it was a function of doing some test work with the combined atmosphere
so you have got to be careful that sometimes you don't over react the thing
then we went back to a different type of atmosphere
did you have a question
the systems you've been describing today seem to take up a lot of space in the orbiter like other systems
how did you negotiate and manage other subsystems for the space and the volume in the way that you wanted
that is a good question but you're asking the wrong person
we are the government
we hired a contractor to design the vehicle
now the design aspects of it the philosophy of it the functionality of it we were very very integral with
we watched we audited we said that looks smart but we didn't go and say put that cold plate here and put that heat exchanger there
the vehicle integrated design was rockwell's
let me tell you how it was done
actually in those years we didn't have cad cam systems
what we did is used everything on mockups
we did mockups
the system was laid out of what to do and the functions of what they had to do and the plumbing
and this was all laid out on a mockup
and basically that was how it was negotiated in terms of what you need
in today's environment you wouldn't do that
you would use electronic capability
you would use your cad cam systems
you would actually draw it up on your computer
in fact the seven hundred seventy seven was built that way
the seven hundred seventy seven at boeing they didn't use hard mockups
they used electronic mockups
and that is what we would do today
and it would be much easier
you would probably call all the engineers together
you would sit down and show how the equipment was laid out get a satisfactory buyoff on it and do it much more rapidly and much more quickly
in the future what you will be doing is actually use a cad cam system or cad system to actually negotiate the space you need for it
that is a good question
and it was based on purely that you would get drawings mockups go out and lay it out in a soft mockup or hard mockup
you would get the engineers to come out the manufacturing people to come out and say this is how it is going to look and then get a buyoff on it
today you wouldn't do it that way
you would do it all electronically so it would change
well let me ask you a question
of all the work you've done in the shuttle what was your biggest concern in getting ready to fly or during the flight
what did you have the biggest concern about
i was young and confident
i don't know that i had a specific area that i was really concerned about
like these people right here right
young and confident
i did recognize though but it did result in the integrated tests that i showed
i did recognize that we had the most highly integrated thermal control system ever conceived
and it had as i said modes within modes
it changed modes with respect to the vehicle phases
it changed modes with respect to operation
we had nine psi that went to ten point two psi
we had eight psi
we had thermal control loops ammonia boilers flash evaporators so i did recognize the sophistication
in fact we proposed early on to use that large chamber in an integrated vehicle test
not we me but the big we looked at an integrated test like the command service module was tested
and that was viewed to be impractical
it was cut it off at the bulkhead
you could do the forward cabin part and then do the aft section but that was viewed to be impractical
but it still was a very integrated design
all the systems engineering that was there created that inner dependency
and i think i was smart enough to know that there was certainly some potential risks there
remember in the very beginning of this i talked about ownership of all the technical aspects
we had ownership
we believed that what we had done was prudent appropriate and we believed it would work
it wasn't like you bought something and you hope it works
can you say a word of what you think this is looking in your crystal ball about the cev
do you think it's going to have a very similar type system or have you thought about that
well we hope so
our new administrator has sort of back to the grassroots philosophy or at least right now
and so we hope that the cev will be developed with a lot of government involvement that the government will have ownership again of the technical aspects of the design
if that happens then i think a lot of the experience that is around and a lot of the free thinking and the independence that the government can bring to that there is another school of thought that says keep the government out of the way and let the contractor go do their thing
and obviously you wouldn't get that position from me but there are people that believe that's the right way to do it
do you think the system will look pretty much like this or similar to it
well similar yes i do think so
i believe that the very tight schedule for the cev is going to put a lot of pressure on the program manager to go with the tried and true
so i don't think there is going to be innovation that has risk with it
maybe there will be innovation that is good engineering but i think the innovation with risk will be very much minimized
because taking shuttle offline in two thousand ten there is going be a lot of pressure to get this vehicle finished
i think that is going to breed some conservatism on the design side
we talk about considering operation while you're doing the design but there were always things once the design was made
well like you mention once we came up with a requirement for a ten point two cabin we had to develop workarounds
and one of the other things that after the system is designed we then start to figure out how can it fail and work on malfunction procedures
and i know that the malfunction procedure for loss of two coolant loops that was probably the worst simulation case that we ever had to deal with
i am curious to get your opinion
walt described how we have two independent cooling loops so that in principle one failure won't take them both out
now i don't remember what it was but they did discover a single point failure somewhere in there which i think was corrected but where you could have lost both of the cooling loops with a single failure
the only failure i remember is one that john young used to worry about
it had to do with if you did lose a radiator that that could bleed your accumulator down
and so they did add an isolation valve so they can isolate the radiator side
but the idea was to obviously not lose your fluid with a single hit
that even though you have a nice completely functional thermal control system it is useless because it has no fluid
we did have an emergency de orbit procedure for loss of two freon cooling loops
and of all the things that we practices that was the hairiest because it was absolutely time critical
at this point you have no way of getting heat out of the cabin so you cannot ultimately cool your electronics
the cabin gets hot your electronics get hot so you have to do an immediate de orbit
hopefully you're within range of a landing site
and then you turn off all the equipment that you can possibly turn off including most of your computers
and when you're riding down through entry you basically watch the temperature of the computer
and as each computer would get up to its failure temperature you would then switch on the next computer transfer the data you know turn off the computer which has just about failed and hopefully you could make it to the ground
and i know the instructors that would lead us through this exercise said that the information they had gotten from the thermal analyst was that nobody was really sure whether we could make it
i don't know what your opinion was or not
we practiced it
but obviously i think i've told you nobody has ever died in a simulator
but you never know whether the thermal model that they use in the simulator is really going to duplicate the way the shuttle is going to behave in an absolute emergency situation like that
we survived in the simulator but i don't know what your feeling is
well we do address the thermal model accuracy
we do specific testing to validate the thermal model so we do have pretty good confidence in those
but the real issue in overheat is that when does a piece of equipment stop working in an overheat situation
i mean there is no magic number
it is not like at one hundred forty three degrees it is ok and one hundred forty four it is not ok
and it varies with age it varies with equipment and it varies with a lot of things
so there wasn't really a precise answer as to how long you could keep everything functional and come home
yes
you talked earlier a little about oxygen and nitrogen mixing in the cabin
i was wondering if there is a way to really study that on the ground since you're not in a dod environment
how do you know there are not pockets of nitrogen sitting around that an astronaut can stick his heat into
very good
i just forgot to mention that earlier
the testing that we ran we had to set it up very carefully
if you notice there is a flight deck and a mid deck so obviously buoyancy is going to mix that stuff for you
what we did is set up a thermal condition where less than one degree thermal gradient everywhere in there had to exist before we ran the test
and that was to guaranty that we had no help from the naturally induced circulation
but you are absolutely right
that test would have been a useless test without neutralizing the gravity effects
and actually the first time that i did the spacesuit test in there we actually used the ten point two protocol
so i actually had to go in the day before take the cabin to ten point two spend the night and then we could do just a forty minute prebreathe
for most of the other tests when you go in in order to avoid the inconvenience and expense of staying through the night you go in early in the morning
and then you're coming right from a sea level environment
so before you go down to four psi in the suit you actually have to prebreathe pure oxygen for four hours
as walt said that was the alternative
you basically just get in your suit
you can either bring a book and read your book or they will pipe music into you if you want to give them a cd or i guess there was an audiocassette in those days or they have a little black and white tv monitor
and you just sort of sit there for four hours
and the problem is you're not allowed to go to sleep
that would be the easiest thing but they want you actually to move around because when you're moving your muscles you're actually then doing a better job of de nitrogenating
so you have to stay awake
and if you don't say anything for more than about ten minutes they will pipe something in and say jeff are you awake
but this was a very very useful facility
i mean they used it for all different sorts of things
and i guess that was the one new facility which was built for the shuttle specifically
yes
jeff mentioned several times the ten point two and i talked about the nine
the nine was the original design but the issues with the nine psi had to do with the oxygen percentage got too high
and so there was much concern about flammability
the idea was if you could raise the pressure up some to ten point two then that would be less of a flammability issue
but then the problem became at ten point two that the suit at four psi was too much of a drop
if you're in the bends while diving somebody mentioned diving earlier scuba you could usually use a two to one
if you don't reduce pressure more than half you're probably ok
you're probably not going to get the bends but half of ten point two is not four
and the suit is at four so there was that issue again
they raised and bumped the suit up a little bit and got it up to four point three and went to ten point two and developed the prebreathe protocols that made that acceptable
that is sort of how it balanced out
that was another operational move later
and as walt said you're spending enough time once you get in the suit and you purge all the nitrogen out and so you're sitting in a pure oxygen environment you've got to do a bunch of tests and check out communication tests and cooling tests
you basically are not losing much time by having to spend forty minutes prebreathing
the whole thing worked out pretty well
and it will be an interesting question on how they designed the cev because the cev has to be compatible with docking to the space station which works at a sea level environment
but on the other hand if you're going to take the cev into a situation where you want to do a lot of space walks you probably want to be able to operate it at more like eight point five or nine psi so that you can go right into a spacesuit without an extensive prebreathe
and of course people are always trying to figure out could we design the spacesuit to work at a higher pressure
but then you give up maneuverability
we will talk about that in another lecture that i will be giving on eva systems
walt thank you very much
i enjoyed it
we're quite lucky today to have bob sieck talk to us about launch operations
bob joined nasa early in his career after a spell with the air force
this was in the early sixty s
and he worked on prelaunch checkout and servicing of gemini and apollo
then went into the shuttle program
he worked on ground operations for the approach and landing tests
we will hear more about that testing when gordon fullerton comes here at the beginning of december
and then he worked as launch director for a lot of the early shuttle missions including my first flight
and then went to be the shuttle operations director at kennedy space center
but then after the challenger accident he came back and worked on another i don't know forty or so launches
i think my last launch was in ninety six
you had already graduated right
yeah
but bob was the launch director of the first four of my flights
he is the head of the whole team of really thousands of people who are responsible for getting the shuttle ready to fly and for certifying that in fact it is ready to fly
it is a very complicated critical and from the safety point of view absolutely one of the most important things we do is to figure out when this incredibly complex vehicle is really ready to go
bob is going to talk to us both about some of the technical aspects of the launch operations
but also i hope from a systems engineering point of view we will have a chance towards the end to talk about some of the planning that was going on while the shuttle was being designed and some of the compromises which had to be made some of which we've already addressed between the efficiency of turning around and maintaining a vehicle like the shuttle vis vis the actually initial upfront cost of it
with that as an introduction bob i will turn it over to you
thanks jeff
and good morning
as jeff indicated i got into the business of launching people and payloads into space a long time ago
i was privileged to be part of all of the human space flight programs so i did a lot of that
what i didn't do i saw most of
and i have an opinion on all of it so please ask questions
if i don't have the answer i am sure to have an opinion
i am going to spend a little bit of time we talk about launch operations but that's the final three to four days of a campaign that begins three to four months before you actually start the countdown clocks and put the astronauts in the vehicle and go fly
so i am going to spend some time on the background of preparing the shuttle the ground systems
the flight systems prior to the launch count process particularly to talk about the engineering involvement and the responsibilities in those processes
but in order to talk about launching i have to talk some about the operations of putting the final pieces together and doing the tests and inspections prior to launch
and then i want to get into the real meat of it which is the human factors the role of the engineer the role of the managers in the process of testing inspecting checking the flight systems the ground systems and certifying that it is ok to put the crew in and go fly
and that's where we're going to spend most of our time but i've got to go through some background first
i don't know how many of you have been to the kennedy space center
anybody been down there
ok so you've seen it
it is a city where we've launched everything since the beginning programs mercury gemini
apollo
the most prominent fixture is this vehicle assembly building which was used for the apollo program to put together the three hundred foot tall saturn apollo rocket
shuttle is about half that size but we use this building to do the assembly
and i will talk a little bit about that later
but it is a city
we have our own power systems
we have facilities to check out the orbiter to process the solid rocket motors
we have administrative homes for the people
and of course we have the highly visible launch pads that are out on the ocean
and we also have a runway
when the weather cooperates and we can bring the shuttles back to florida we can take care of the landing and recovery there
the process
we'll talk a little bit about the process
when an orbiter returns from its previous mission it goes through essentially a disassembly
inspection and then build it back up and test it to make sure that it is still within the certification base that the engineers set up for it that you've already heard from previous to this lecture
you would like to think that if the orbiter flies and the rest of the element is a successful mission you can just do it like an airplane take down the down cargo whatever get it configured for the next payload that is going to go up clean the windshield so to speak and the crew cabin and go fly it again
but the rules don't allow you to do that
the rules that the other engineers who have talked to you have set up are such that you have to assume that in some way even though during the mission everything seemed to work ok that that hardware was compromised through the process of reentering landing refurbishing those systems that have to be refurbished
something may have been invalidated
so you have to test all that stuff that worked just fine in the previous mission plus all of the systems that were not used in the previous mission particularly the backup system the things that you would have to rely on in the event that the primary system doesn't cooperate during the next mission
and because of the way the orbiter was built with its miles of wiring and thousands of components that are active components you have to disassemble a lot of that stuff in order to meet the requirements that the program is levied on
after the orbiter lands and you get it safe and the crew is out and you take out the payload
we spend a minimum of two to three months roughly a quarter of a million labor hours of touch labor on the orbiter to do this disassembly test inspection refurbishment process before we move it from the hanger take it to that vehicle assembly building integrate it with the tank and the solid rocket boosters and take it on out to the launch pad to go fly again
and that's where the lion's share of the work is
the work on the tank and the payloads and the solid rocket boosters is all peripheral to the processing of the orbiter
yes sir
do you find a lot of failures when you go through
we find very few
and you could do the tradeoff of well is this effort worth it
but on the other hand the few that you find you're glad that you found them because if not you may not have discovered them until you got out to the launch pad and serviced your hazardous systems
or worse yet you find out when you get in the mission
and then the impact of that could be not only a safety impact but could be a higher consequence than spending the month to two months in an orbiter processing facility doing that work
yes
but is there a learning curve
i mean after each mission do you know which system you have to look at specifically
we look at it and say this system is performing just fine so we don't have to do this intense invasive inspection and test every flight
maybe we can just do it once a calendar year or every two to three missions whatever the designer thinks is the criteria for checking on the health of this system
and we've done that over the years
and after we've had a couple of years of missions where everything is working just fine we start relaxing these requirements
and then something like challenger happens or something like columbia happens and the pendulum of conservatism swings the other direction
and we do more tests and more inspections to verify the hardware because people want to be able to say and we want to be able to say well we've done everything possible to make sure that that's a one hundred percents functional operating safe orbiter
and so getting this process down to where it meets the original advertising brochure which was we're going to fly these things every two to three weeks you start in that direction
and then events occur either during the mission or you have the really bad incidents like challenger and columbia
and the conservatism swings the other way and you end up doing more work
and in addition to that engineers because we are what we are i was one we have all this hardware available we like to modify it
we change it
we upgrade it because there is new technology available in computers or in composite materials
so when the orbiter gets to this processing facility regardless of how well the mission flew the designers with their good intensions say we want this orbiter to last another five years or ten years so we want you to do this upgrade to the avionics system or we want to change out all of the actuators that hold the payload in the payload bay and this and that
so you modify
and that adds more time
it makes more complexity to the process which invites more tests and inspections
you're constantly in a mode where unfortunately if the mission flies perfectly by the time you plan your campaign through the processing facility you plan your campaign with schedules to last two months maybe roughly a third of the work you do is work that you hadn't planned when you initially brought that orbiter into the orbiter processing facility
it's nonstandard work
it is stuff that you uncover in the process of doing your test or inspection or its new requirements or new changes that come from the designers that have to be implemented
and from an efficiency standpoint if you're in the manufacturing or production business that is not efficient
if a third of your work that you laid out for the next two months at the end of that two month period a third of it was stuff that you had not planned on doing which means you don't have the parts ready you don't have the engineering you don't have the instructions
yes
do you build in time to cover that now
contingency time yes
let me go back to that
we set up our team and operations to run five days a week two shifts a day leaving the weekends free to catch up for this nonstandard stuff
we essentially end up running a six day work week if we're in a standard template of flying three missions a year which we're not now because we're still recovering from the columbia accident
we end up working six days a week and roughly every three or four days we will work a continuous around the clock twenty four hour operation
we try to maintain that original schedule but we only make it roughly fifty percents of the time due to this again nonstandard work the extra stuff that works its way in
and that's why we have a big team
our team is made up of the united space alliance as a contractor
they do the hands on work
they have the technicians
they have the engineers that staff the consoles
and they are roughly a six thousand population at kennedy space center
they take care of the orbiter the tank the boosters
they are responsible for maintaining all of our equipment that hooks into the shuttle that is required the process of servicing it
and they have ties to the contractors the original equipment manufacturers that built the hardware
technically they can gain access to all the original manufacturing records for the parts that are in the shuttle
nasa's responsibility nasa owns the requirements for the shuttle
we delegated all the operational work to the contractors but it's a national resource
taxpayers paid for it
the government has a responsibility
they cannot divest themselves from that
nasa owns the requirements for saying what you test what you inspect and what the specifications are for acceptable performance of that
that is controlled by nasa
the management of the contractor at kennedy is done by nasa engineers in an organization that has roughly five hundred people out of the two thousand population at kennedy space center of civil service people five hundred are directly associated with the shuttle
the rest do payload work
the space station of course is a big work item now at the kennedy space center
and they are responsible for the requirements
if somebody wants to change the requirement a nasa person has to approve that change
and we do insight and everything the contractor does
we have at each one of the milestones when we leave the processing facility when we leave the vehicle assembly building and when we get ready to launch there is a review conducted by nasa to review the work that was done by the contractor during the preceding weeks or months
and nasa approves moving the vehicle onto the next stage of its assembly prior to launch
and the launch director specifically is responsible not only for those last few days of the campaign
so to speak leading up to launch but also insuring the government contractor team has all the tools available to them to be successful
is the work being scheduled in an orderly fashion
is the ever tightening budget constraining their ability to get their work done
is there too much scheduled pressure to meet a milestone
that is the launch director's job
the launch director doesn't just come in the last three days of the campaign with a tie and a suit and orchestrate the countdown
they have a responsibility from the beginning to the end of the campaign
engineering
i have already addressed this but the nasa engineers manage the requirements the changes to the requirements
they are the ones in addition to the contractor this is a check and balance that look at all the data the engineering results of the tests and the inspections
and they approve that they met the requirements
also they participate in critical operations
a critical operation is a test on a specific system
servicing of the vehicle for launch count or any of the non standard work that comes up during the process
they audit what the contractor does
and of course because we're the customer and they are the contractor we have a lot of criteria to grade them on for their award fee performance
the operations people manage the scheduling
as i indicated we like to work five days a week two shifts a day
we really end up working six days a week and sometimes around the clock
the scheduling activity is dynamic
and nasa approves all the scheduling
we have to approve all the overtime
we have the authority to say stop or go not only in launch count but anywhere in the campaign of processing the hardware as well as the big picture schedule you know how many times a year you're going to fly and which orbiter is assigned to which payload in those missions
that is still a nasa responsibility
orbiter processing facility like i mentioned before it is like a hanger for an airplane
a big part of the work effort used to be the tile
i think you already had a presentation on tile
there are twenty five thousand to thirty thousand of these little bricks glued to the vehicle
we classically damage about a hundred of them on each mission due to ice and things coming off the tank that have to be replaced but we also pull another hundred or so off just to inspect the integrity of the glue that is holding the tile to the structure of the vehicle
because a lot of those little bricks have been glued on there for twenty five years and have flown twenty five to thirty missions
although we have offline test programs that try to duplicate the environment that the tile sees either from a calendar standpoint or the thermal cycles of the mission you would like to go to the real hardware and see what is happening
we do that invasive type of work of actually destroying tile pulling it off the vehicle just to make sure that the aging process is not causing any degradation of the system
we pull the engines out and do the maintenance on the engines offline because the aft fuselage of the orbiter is a terrible place to work
any of the hardware we can get out of there and do it on the bench it is much better to do that than to try to do it in the vehicle with people crawling all over wire bundles and structure and that sort of thing
they are concerned about the collateral damage to do the other work in that compartment of the vehicle where the engines are
of course you've got to take the accommodations from the previous mission out of the payload bay and put in the new stuff for the next mission
i already mentioned modifications
unfortunately we change more stuff than we probably should but in order to keep up with the aging of the vehicle and the new technology that goes with the territory of flying a system that was designed over thirty years ago
and we prepared for the next milestone which was the vehicle assembly building operations
this is where we put the big pieces together
the solid rocket boosters are stacked
there are four segments in each booster
that is a very critical process but only takes less than a month to do
the external tank comes in essentially ready to fly from mississippi
except as you know now because of the columbia accident we are still looking at the ramifications of these lines and other fittings on the tank
the acreage foam on the tank just to digress a little bit is sprayed on
and that stuff is tough
early in the program we had problems with some of that coming off but we solved that years ago
what we haven't solved is where you have to do a manual application of foam over a fitting that is there because that is where the crane is attached to it or because there is a line there that has to be installed at the kennedy space center
you cannot do it back at the factory
putting that thermal protection system foam on there is a labor intensive process
it is a critical technique process
and obviously there are still flaws in the process that the engineers haven't sorted out yet
and that is why that stuff keeps coming off the tank in those places
but the solid rocket motors are attached to this mobile launch platform with four bolts the diameter of my wrist
the structure engineers really figured this out good
there are four on each one of those that are attached to the launch platform
the tank is attached to the boosters with four attach points and those are bolts again that are the diameter of my wrist
and then the orbiter is hung on the tank in three places with the same sized bolts
you've got six million pounds of weight that is attached to the mobile launch platform that is held up by these four bolts well eight total on the solid rocket motors
and they work out the dynamics of when the engines start because the vehicles sways like this because the center of gravity is not right over where those eight bolts are attached
and that system works fine
it always amazed me that you could hang that much weight on those few bolts that are only the diameter of this but it works
the orbiter is brought over after its campaign it's hung on the tank and we test all those connections between the solid rocket booster the platform the tank and the orbiter
and that only takes about a week to do that
and if that looks good we have a review of all of that work
and if the review says we didn't leave anything undone that we shouldn't take out the launch pad then we go out to the launch pad
sure
say a little bit about this difference from just bringing your car into have a fifty thousand mile checkup that is the clean room aspects the following of procedures of having a checker
sure
well a fifty thousand mile checkup on a car is usually an external inspection
you change the oil and the filter and you check all the belts and the radiator hoses and you change all the fluids
well you do that with the orbiter also
but in the case of the orbiter you want to know whether you are this far away from having to do a valve job or the rings in the engine have now got so many thousand miles on them
we have the equivalent
you take the heads off the engine and you give it a valve job
and you take the pistons out of the block and you check for scoring in the block
you take the transmission out and you pull the gears out and make sure that the synchronizers are still ok
and you go through the rear end
and you take all the avionics out
or you take your carry on test equipment in and you hook it up to these connectors on the airflow meter and the computer in your vehicle and you run all those diagnostics to make sure all that stuff even though it worked fine after you turned that ignition key off the last time that all the redundancies and all the capability is still within that hardware and all the margins are still there
and then you button it back up and you make sure you button it back up properly all of which is pre established quite rigid flowcharts checklists
a checker checking the checker
oh yes and you have inspectors where there are critical things
if you're torquing the connecting rods onto the crankshaft it says that you've got to do those bolts at fifty something foot pounds
and the technician will do that
and there will be an inspector there verifying that he set the torque wrench at fifty foot pounds and it really clicked there and they stamp the procedure that it was done that way
i wanted to just add to that i mean even more emphasis
you don't do anything to the vehicle or to the payload unless you have a written procedure
what is absolutely not allowed is oh there is a little problem something didn't work the way it was supposed to in the test
let's just fiddle around
let's throw a few switches and see what happens
well i mean that is normally the way you work at things if you're in a laboratory or working on your car
but the thing is you need absolute traceability
because if something later on turns up out of spec or there is an anomaly during flight you need to be able to recreate everything that was done to the orbiter
that is why we keep such good records on parts
well you can tell you that story about the tires that you just mentioned
people keep track of where all the parts of the orbiter came from the lot numbers
and so if any problem turns up you can actually then trace on the orbiter and see if it affects there
all the work is done for approved work authorization documents every step every touch labor item that is done on the vehicle
and if you deviate from that procedure which is approved by engineering you have to get engineering approval to deviate from it
the assembly process the standard work process of putting the vehicle together after a mission there is over two million verifiable work items for the standard flow
and that doesn't include modifications or the nonstandard work that comes up the proverbial glitch that occurs when you're checking out your computer system or when you pressurize this fluid system and the leak rate is higher than the specification allows
well engineering comes in and says ok here is the trouble procedure
here is what you're going to pursue but you don't do any of that until the engineers write the procedure and give it to the technicians or the console operators that say ok here is what you're going to do to try to find out the source of this leak
as jeff indicated you don't just start throwing switches and turning valves and say well let's see if we can find out what's going on here
it is all pre approved
and the reason for that is when you have these reviews that culminate into final review before you get ready to fly you want to be able to say that this vehicle is assembled per print that the designer's requirements the people that you've already heard from that certified that this system will work just fine in flight if it looks like this when we launch it you're trying to prove that this is what it looks like when you launch it and it is within the certification base and it is per the engineering drawings that we were given and it met all these requirements
otherwise you are guessing that it is ok to go fly the machine
and you cannot do that in this business
yes
does that seem to create any sort of tension on the engineers feeling like their hands are tied to go out and do stuff
well no because they are the ones that ultimately say what goes in those two million steps
and if they want to add more tests or checks or inspections it is within their purview to propose that
the program there is a group of senior engineers that are on these what we call control boards that approve the requirements that are implemented at the kennedy space center
and they can say yeah that's a good idea or no we don't want to change this go back and give us some more rationale for what you think is a good idea to do to this system
in that respect it is probably somewhat frustrating for the engineers because they cannot do anything different from last time unless they can justify the rationale for it
but that's the way it ought to be
the launch pad
the facilities at the launch pad are pretty simple
these are the same launch pads we flew from in apollo
we've got storage facilities for the liquid hydrogen liquid oxygen
we try to spend a minimum amount of time at the launch pad because florida is a nice place to be on spring break but it's a bad place to have exotic hardware sitting outdoors with all that salt humidity and all the other elements that mother nature throws at you like lightening
and i think you can see down here we have a good lightening protection system
there is a single mast with two wires that go out about a half a mile from the launch pad
it makes a good faraday shield
and over the years we've been whacked a lot of times with lightening
in fact it's a good attraction for lightening
and we have never gotten energy inside of that faraday shield to damage any hardware
however when we get lightening down there we tell the workers to stand down and of course seek safe haven
but we have instrumented it
and it has taken some big hits but we haven't gotten anything major inside that would cause us a problem from electric
yes
after you take the shuttle out onto the launch pad is it very expensive to roll it back when you find a problem and then bring it back out again
yes it is
and that's why we have these reviews before we commit it to go to the launch pad to make sure that we're not taking any unknowns or any work out to the launch pad that should rightfully be done either in the vehicle assembly building or further back in the orbiter processing facility
it is a lengthy process because it takes about a week to hook everything up at the pad and check it before you go into the process of servicing the propellants and doing the hazardous work which has to all be undone if you roll back to the vehicle assembly building
you've got to make sure you're really ready to go before you head on out there
yes
approximately how many times has that happened
going back
well we probably have done it for technical reasons maybe twenty percents of the time
for weather reasons like we're worried about a hurricane or something like that the same about twenty percents of the time
one out of every five times we've gone to the launch pad we've had to come back for either a weather problem or a technical problem that either occurred at the launch pad or it's something that happened with a different vehicle in the fleet that may still be in the orbiter processing facility or a components that is similar to one that is on the shuttle that is at the pad that they were doing testing in the laboratory or doing what we call fleet leader testing at one of the nasa facilities
and they said you know there is an inherent flaw in this auxiliary power unit and we have to change the ones that are in the orbiter because they were manufactured at the same time or they have the same component on them and you cannot do that work out at the launch pad so you've got to roll it back
so the hardware at the pad may be just fine from the standpoint that you followed your processes and they checked out great in the previous part of the campaign
but an offline issue can cause you to say no we've got to roll back and go change out this hardware or fix it or further test it before we can commit it to go fly
we have a big water tower out there also which i will talk about later
that is our sound suppression system
but basically a month is the maximum time you like to spend out there
we used to put a lot of payloads in the orbiter processing facility when we were flying laboratories and that sort of thing
space station hardware we install all that out at the launch pad now
and we test all the connections at the new facility
and we have a simulated launch count with the astronauts
and this is a tradition that goes back to the mercury program
they bring the astronauts down to the cape
they go through a day two days of training emergency egress familiarization with the hardware and then we have a simulated launch count without the propellants and all the hazardous stuff just to if nothing else remind the launch team that this is more than just a machine
we are going to fly people in this thing
and this occurs roughly two weeks before launch
and it is a good readiness test for the whole team
it's serious
we're a couple weeks before flight
the crew is in town
this vehicle is going to look the best it ever has
and we do a simulated launch countdown to within a couple seconds of liftoff
and then we do a simulated abort with the safeing of the vehicle and the crew gets out
and i will just add something
that is always something the crew looked forward to first of all because you actually get to get in the vehicle which despite the fact that we have pretty good simulators in houston there is nothing like actually crawling inside the shuttle that you're going to fly in
and there is a lot of safety training that you do down at the cape which is really kind of fun
you don't have any pictures of the launch escape the pad slide wire basket
no i don't think so
there is a requirement that you need to be able to get off the pad quickly if there is a launch emergency
and of course on the real launch day unlike the simulated countdown where the pad is crawling with people on launch day there are very few people even when you're getting into the vehicle because it is fueled
and then everybody else leaves
so they have this big slide wire where if you have to get out of the orbiter in a hurray you go out and you jump in the bag hit a little guillotine and it cuts you loose and you slide all the way down
actually in the early days the astronauts kept saying we need to try this out
and they said no you cannot do it because it hasn't been man rated
we said wait a minute
well it's rated for emergency use only so you cannot try it out
and then after challenger they insisted that somebody actually ride down in it
not every crew
just one person tried it out
but the other thing that you do once you get down to the bottom there is an underground bunker that you run into
and either you stay there and wait for help or they have these armored personnel carriers sitting around there with little tanks which you get in
and you've got to be able to drive your tank
they have a breakout section of the fence so you drive the tank through the fence out to a helicopter pickup point
so we all have to go out and learn how to drive the tank
and we drive over the sand dunes and everything
and then also they have a big pool which they light on fire
and they give you a big fireman's hose and they show you how to make your way through a fire by squirting a water path in front of you
all the little things you dream of as a kid to be a fireman drive a tank
so it's good fun
but it is part of the extensive safety procedures that they have
and all these things periodically they have to exercise
they do go through every once in a while a disaster drill down at the cape where they simulate an emergency where they have to pick up the crew either outside the launch pad or either out in the ocean
and you've got to keep people at full operational readiness
that's one of the aspects of training
we train for the anomalies the nonstandard things
the standard work they do so much of that anyway you don't have to train for that
you don't have to train to put a payload in the payload bay
you don't have to train to power up your system and run your system checkout because that is a repetitive thing
but the nonstandard stuff when things go wrong that's where the emphasis of the training is
and like jeff said it's a lot of fun
it's fun for the launch team too
we have a control center at the cape and it is called the launch control center
you would think this is where you launch it from
well you do that
but all of the other work that is done in the preceding three months is controlled from the launch control center by test conductors and engineers who wrote the procedures and the software that implement all the requirements
and they control the activity on the orbiter or the tank or the boosters when it is still back in the offline facilities or the vehicle assembly building or out to the launch pad
they do it from the launch control center
we automate what we can from there
but for the manual activity and a lot of it is manual because regrettably you cannot do all this refurbishment on the shuttle with automated systems
it wasn't built that way
it is all managed from out launch control center with old computers but with a great team of people
the software we use in the computers i am not going to go into a lot of detail because it is really old stuff but it works
it is like the software program that the faa uses to track airplanes
it is hacker proof
there are no external interfaces outside of the launch control center firewall
it works just fine
and that is where we do the management of our day to day operations from our launch control room
and we call it the lps launch processing system software
we've tried to change it a couple of times over the years
buy new hardware
we have supplemented it with laptops so that we can do more human engineering displays but the computers are the same ones that we bought back in the late seventy s
but then so are the computers that are on the orbiter that fly the machine
so it works
this is a bit repetitive but i want to go through it again to make sure to emphasize what the role of the engineering is
the designers that you've heard from they certified their design
and they did extensive testing just like detroit does on a car on the door latch
and they've tested that door latch and said well this thing out to be good for two hundred fifty thousand miles or twenty years or so many gazillion opening and closings of the door before it wears out and you've got to replace it
well they did all that
and to make sure that that hardware is still within the certification base they developed requirements sent them down to the cape
we put them in the procedures either manual procedures or software to implement those requirements
and the team united space alliance the contractor and the nasa engineers will certify at each of the milestone reviews and the process of moving the hardware out to the pad they've met those requirements
and they did that either by participating in the activity or by reviewing the test data
and that allows us to sign a certificate of flight readiness a few days before launch that all the requirements have been met
when we get into launch count we take in a subset of those requirements that when everything is powered up and ready to go fly all of these systems that are active ought to look like this
the voltages should be between this upper limit and this lower limit
the pressure should be between here and here
these indicators should show that they are open and these indicators should say that this latch is closed or the valve is closed or whatever
and we put that in what is called launch commit criteria
and that is the acceptable limit for the performance of that hardware when you're at that point which is nine minutes before launch when everybody commits that they are ready to go fly
and all those requirements again are implemented by procedures in software
and the three days of launch count have roughly these are numbers but about five hundred requirements
there are thousands of measurements associated with those requirements
and most of the looking at those measurements is done by computers obviously
but you have the engineer involved because if it is not within limits you turn to the engineer for what is wrong
is there any chance to go fix this or do we have to change hardware
do we have to do trouble shooting
so it's not a hands off operation obviously
the structure of the launch team the launch director is shown in the middle but that doesn't mean he or she is the only one with a go or a no go button
the people the implement the requirements there are roughly one hundred fifty of them in our control center and they are the ones that provide the go no go for all the subsystems both flight and ground that everything is operating within the limits
they report that to a team of test conductors nasa and contractor and that's reported to the launch director
we are not along obviously
we have an engineering support area which are all the hidden senior engineers that you don't see on television
and there is a room full of about one hundred fifty to two hundred of those
and they are looking at the performance of these systems as they are activated in launch count
and they've got all the trend data the previous history of it
and they're looking at things like well all right everything is in limits but is it within family
the last time the system performed the voltage with this or the pressure was this
well it's still in limits
but it's not the same as it was before so we go look at it
well that's for this group of engineers over here
these guys and gals are running through their procedures
and if everything was within limits we just turn to the next page and go onto the next one
and they also have the emergency procedures
if something bad happens these are the people that will implement the emergency procedures
this offline support they're out there
they're the senior people they've been there before they've been out there who knows how many years and they're asking questions like that didn't look right or we missed that step go back and check it again
that's what they are for
the mission management team over here these are the people that do the certificate of flight readiness
these are the folks that stand up in the readiness reviews and say i gave the cape folks a good set of requirements
there is nothing that happened with the hardware that they're responsible for
and all those offline facilities are on previous missions
that shouldn't have any cloud over this mission
they are responsible for certifying that
and they do that through a structure of the mission management team
you've got of course the flight director with flight rules and the flight team that they look at during the launch count process
and you will hear more about that from wayne hale
and they obviously have a go no go input to the launch director in the decision process also
we have an integration activity
they system engineers are each responsible for you know they have boundary conditions on what they are responsible for
it is these pieces of hardware
it is this wiring
it is these actuators or latches or whatever
but a lot of that stuff fits together
integration is a technical term for making sure that this person talks to this person and that they are hooked in with this one
that activity is done by a console in the control room again with senior engineers who actually manage all the automated software that runs the last couple hours of launch count that really launches the vehicle
and they are tied in with that
you also have the more subjective stuff
we launch on a public range
public safety is obviously an issue so the range has to make sure that it is safe to fly from a public standpoint there are no boats in the launch danger area no airplanes and that the weather meets the criteria of being able to track the vehicle should it go off course
and of course the payload has to certify particularly if there is an active payload that all of their launch commit criteria is met
and last but certainly not least you have safety oversight of all of that activity
and what i don't show on there of course is the flight crew but they are obviously in communication with all of these people
so that is the network
but everybody out here has no go authority
anybody can come on the net or press their switch and say i've got a problem we're not going anywhere
and it is the launch director and the launch team's responsibility to make sure that problem is addressed hold at the convenient graceful to stop all the activity hold point until the issue is resolved
the real job and i'll get into this later of the launch director is to say no when everybody else wants to go because as you get further into the launch count the launch fever process sets in
it is a natural thing it seems to be
people want to go
i want to ask you about that a little bit i know we'll get into it later on but flight rules and the launch decision there are flight rules that say you must scrub if these conditions are not met
right
and yet there is a tendency to allow judgment to come in
let's take an example of a limit on crosswind at you landing to the return to launch site
you see it go above limits but the rules strictly says no you cannot go
talk about that a little bit
that is what we use the mission management team for
and you bring up the weather example
most of this stuff is pretty straightforward
it is either the voltage pressure temperature is in limits or out of limits
a person can question that and say i don't like the trend and you've got to stop and clear the air if they say i want more discussion on this i want more data review and that sort of thing
if it is a discussion like that involves activity outside of the control room beyond the purview of the console operators that are running through the procedure we rely on the mission management team to manage that activity so the console operators can concentrate on their launch commit criteria and their procedures and their software
something like crosswind limits if there is a debate with the flight director and the weather people we hold the clock and say mission management team that is yours
you manage it and whatever you have to do to resolve the decision we'll scrub if need be
we'll hold if need be or if the community can get comfortable that these crosswinds that are peaking occasionally out of spec that it's ok to go fly anyway then we will wait to hear from the flight director that that's ok
we don't insulate the control room from that but we don't want to burden the control center with work and what is an offline issue
and it is up to the mission management team to disposition that
and you bring up weather because weather is one of the few things that there is really a lot of judgment still involved
is the weather good enough to go fly
and it is probably the only thing that is in that category because everybody has an opinion on the weather
and florida weather is dynamic
and usually unless it is wintertime there are clouds
and there is always a tendency if you've held for weather or the weather is marginal to hold longer to see if the weather gets better
and the real issue for the launch director is to try to convince people if the weather is good enough that this is good enough
and yeah you could wait longer for it to get better but it's good enough
we're running out of window time
all the time we sit here on the ground with all these systems humming along the probability of some glitch or something coming up to scrub you is increased
and just as a personal note when i was i the air force i was a weather forecaster for missile operations
and i felt that that was a waste of an engineer's time because i was a graduate engineer with my diploma sticking out of my pocket
i wanted to go launch missiles and rockets and the air force said lieutenant sieck is going to be a weather forecaster supporting missile operations
i endured that for a couple of years and put all of that experience in my hip pocket
and i didn't need it until i got into this launch director job
and i spent many hours talking to the weather people who provide the forecast for the launch going over all of the data and the technical aspects of the weather situation to see if there it was prudent to sit here any longer and wait for the weather to improve or whether it was better to scrub get these guys out of their uncomfortable suits and send them back to crew quarters and recycle for the next day
and they won't necessarily scrub but you have to disposition their concern
and you will hold until their concern is taken care of
yes
this is unrelated but you know how the russians in going out to the launch pad use a rail track and they have the rocket flat
can you do that with the shuttle
instead of stacking it like this and then rolling it out would it be better easier
well the problem with that are the solid rocket boosters
they weight approximately when assembled a little less than three million pounds a piece
and the joints that caused the challenger accident are critical
and i don't know if they went through the technical aspects of the design but these things are fourteen feet in diameter
each segment weighs three hundred thousand pounds and they have these two cleavaces that come together with o rings in there
and what caused the challenger accident was there was rotation in these joints to the point where the o rings because of cold weather weren't making a good seal and caused a gas path
and one thousand two hundred degree temperature
exhaust plume just cut through the metal once it found a path
so you want to maintain the integrity of these joints
if you stacked them horizontally and that could be done and then you lift this thing vertically the joints aren't certified to maintain their integrity doing that
plus you'd need some kind of huge crane to pull this three million pounds from horizontal to vertical
i think it's something that could have been done had it been built into the design at the beginning
and the russians have a tradition of doing this
and so that is the way they design their rockets
for whatever reason we never started that way
from the very beginning our rockets got stacked vertically
and that's the way all of the american rockets have been designed
yes
the launch director whether it is flight worthy actually that mission management team is responsible for the flight worthiness because they encompass not only watching what you did in launch count but the certification of all this hardware before it even got to the launch pad
and ultimately the launch director is responsible for conducting an orderly launch and making sure that this mission management team doesn't have any issues that that engineering team doesn't have any issues that the console operators have really completed their procedures
that is their responsibility
and if there is any fuzz on that so to speak even though console operators say they're go and the mission management team says they're go and flight says they're go if there is any concern about that it's the launch director's job to say no we're not going to go fly today
we are going to give you another day or two days to do more homework look at more data have more discussions
we're going to scrub today even though everybody may say we're go
and that has happened before
and i always wondered after not too many times when i've said no when everybody wants to go whether i'll get the phone call saying well i'm glad you made it safe today sieck but you don't have this job tomorrow
well i never got that call
never did
the process not to bore you with it but since it is an operation normally we try to launch in the middle of a week wednesday or thursday
we usually take the weekend off before that to clean up everything and give the launch team a rest so we power up everything
and that's the way we start the process
and that's a couple of shifts worth of work to bring up the ground systems the flight systems make sure that all the avionics hardware really comes to life
and we put in a no work hold at the end of that to take care of any problems
if that all goes well then we get into the more critical activity that has time constraints associated with it
we load the fuel cell
that is the power plants and the orbiter reactants liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen because they have limited life
even if you don't have the fuel cells activated that stuff boils off and you lose it and that could count against your mission capability
and that is a hazardous operation also
and then we put in another no work hold at the end of that
and then we have a period of time where we bring up the final systems put in the time critical storage particularly when we're flying laboratories and you put in plants or critters or whatever it may be either in the crew module or the payload bay
and the last twelve hours down here is when you really have got to make sure this is a real decision point right here
are we going to load the external tank put a cycle on the tank
and we know that putting liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen and there is roughly half a million gallons in a tank puts stresses into the hardware
you really don't want to do that unless you're pretty sure you're going to launch that day or that night
we have a meeting before that to make sure the weather looks pretty good and that the mission management team is not working any offline issues
and that has happened before
a war story for you
in the early eighty s in one of our missions we assembled the mission management team to decide whether or not we ought to go load the external tank and go fly
everything looked pretty good
and the orbiter project manager said well i need to make you aware of this
i just got a telegram from the manufacturers of the tires
and the manufacturer said they were inspecting a lot a lot of the tires of which we have two of them from the same lot on the orbiter and they found some blems on these tires
and they don't know whether it's a manufacturing flaw or an aging defect
and we don't know whether it affects the integrity of the tires
but since we knew you were launching tomorrow we thought we would share this with you
warm regards bf goodrich i think it was at the time
well the mission management team threw on that on the table and said hey we've got to go work this
these people we don't know they haven't said they're not certifying the tires
they just said they've got a problem
well that's fine
the mission management team go work that and let's talk about whether or not it's prudent
under these circumstances to go load the tank with some probability that we get all the way down to t minus nine minutes and you folks are going to say hey we need to look at more test data on these tires or have more discussions with bf goodrich on whether or not we go fly today
well you don't want to load the tank and go through all that if that's what you think the situation is going to be eight hours away from that
and you've put a cycle on the tank you've used up a lot of cryos that you cannot save because of the heat leak
plus your launch team has put a cycle on depending on the time of day they've been up all day all night or whatever
those are the kinds of issues that you need to make sure get worked
and the mission management team has to handle that but the launch director has to decide just go work that for another day or two
we're not going to load the tank
or what's the promise of this coming to fruition the possibility so that it makes sense to go try to fly
what did you do with the tires
in that case we went ahead and tanked
the subsystem manager for that which you may have already heard from went back to a lot of the test data that they had run on the tires that they had been fairly recent
langley i think was involved in it
and they said we don't have to worry about those blems being a problem for the tires that are on the orbiter which by the way you don't have any access to at the launch pad
if we were going to change the tires you would have to roll back to the orbiter processing facility
and that would be a couple of month's worth of impact to that flight
we ended up not doing anything with the tires but it had the mission management team really busy for about eight hours
and this process takes about three days
and we have refined those procedures as you might expect over the years to make this as an efficient and repetitive a process as we can
in addition to minimizing the hazards to the people and the equipment
before we got to terminal count usually we take like a two minute break
this is a good time to do that
terminal count phase
after the tank is loaded half a million gallons of liquid hydrogen liquid oxygen and there are no leaks and we have leak detectors all over the vehicle and we've scrubbed a lot of launches because of leaks we give the crew a go to come on out
and a crew of seven or eight people it takes an hour and a half to get them all in and get them connected check their communications and that sort of thing
roughly three hours before launch we bring them out we get them all connected we close the hatch and we verify the integrity of the crew module
and clockwise we're down to t minus twenty minutes but if it's a rendezvous window and most of them are now
the launch window is only five to ten minutes long so we have to be in phase with the same plane that the space station is in and we've got to get in phase with being able to catch the space station or have it catch us
the launch window we don't have enough energy in the shuttle to steer to any orbit we'd like to
the launch window is only about ten minutes long so we put in a long hold at t minus nine minutes for those kinds of missions
it is the equivalent of the two minute timeout in a professional football game
everybody has a chance to review their information discuss their strategies if it's a long launch window if it was just a lab mission then we only wait for ten minutes at this t minus nine mark
but if it's a short window we set up the clock such that we hold there for almost an hour
and then as you saw on that previous chart we do a poll of all those people and make sure that they are all still go and they're not working any problems or issues
and then we start this automated software program that looks at in addition to the systems engineers and their consoles looking at all their information we have an automated program called the ground launch sequencer that looks at all the measurements all the parameters to make sure that they are within limits
and it issues all the commands to the vehicle and the ground support equipment
and we did that so we could manage the repeatability of that process
and you had to take the human factor button pressing out of the process as much as possible
and there is not a lot of work that goes on in there
and there is very little manual work
you get five minutes
the orbiter access arm their ability o get out of the vehicle in a big hurry is retracted
it takes two to three minutes to pull that back but we can get it back up to the vehicle in less than thirty seconds which is about the amount of time it takes them to unstrap and get out of there anyway if there's a fire or something bad like that that they have to do an emergency egress
they start the propulsion units on the orbiter that pressurize the hydraulic system
just like on an airplane there is an automated test of all the aero surfaces like they do on the end of a runway
but this is done by the computer and it wiggles the elevons and the rudder and the main engines to make sure all of that works
and we also start the conditioning of the propellant at the engine interface
and they already had the discussion about the main engines
you have to make sure that the quality of the fluid in the external tank and the quality of it that's right there at the injector of the engine is within the temperature and density parameters that the engine was certified at
because we have to drain the propellant out of the fill lines
and once we've started doing that that propellant starts heating up right there on those valves that are going to go into the injector and start the main engines on the orbiter
that limits our ability to stop and hold after that
we are good for four to five minutes after that starts
and that process starts at t minus five minutes
after that point in time we are either going to launch or scrub in the next ten minutes
and then we pressurize the oxygen tank and we pressurize the hydrogen tank but anywhere in this period of time we can stop
if an engineer or the automated sequencer says something is out of limits we will stop at those milestones and disposition that problem if we can
but per our rules we won't waive any requirements at that point
even though an engineer may have a perfectly good explanation as to why this temperature
pressure or whatever our limit is not being met if the launch commit criteria the launch rules says no it has to be like this then we're not going to go launch that day
we won't
after thirty one seconds the solid rocket boosters come to life
the propellant doesn't ignite but their hydraulic system is powered up
their avionics systems are powered up
their engine nozzles are checked again in an automatic sequence
and at ten seconds if everything looks good and all these measurements that our ground launch sequencer has been looking at we send up the computer data bus a go to the onboard computers that said all of our stuff has been satisfied
now we're still looking at a few things
we're looking at those bolts that are holding the solid rocket motors to the launch pad
and the ability to blow the nuts that are holding them should that system fail we would send the cutoff to the onboard computers
regardless of where the engines were in their startup sequence the three main engines everything will stop
and hopefully it will gracefully come to a stop and we will safe all the systems and go from there
but that is the final handshake that is preplanned between flight and ground is that ten seconds when we send a command up to the computer saying we are all go
we can still shut you off and we can shut you off manually too
if a console operator sees something happening that they think could compromise the safety of the launch they can call for a cutoff
and we have a switch that says cutoff
it sends a command to the onboard computers and it will stop everything within ten to twenty milliseconds
but you don't like to put humans in a position to have to make that call
and that's why all of the critical stuff is done by the computers
and i mentioned the ground launch sequencer
that's a console and operators in the back of the control room
and they are the ones by the way that determine nobody presses a button for launch
a woman in the back of the control room types the liftoff time into the computer when the launch director tells her hey look it looks like we're going to come out of our t minus nine minute hold at this point in time
so here is the liftoff time
put that in the computer
and after that it's a hands off operation
can i ask are these commands being physically sent i mean they're hard line cable
it's what we call a launch data vest
it's a cable that is connected from the computers in the control room through the liftoff umbilical into the orbiter computers
it's a data train
and when is that connection broken
at liftoff
the onboard computers will check the health of the main engines and if the three main engines are within all of their operating parameters the turbines and the pumps and the temperatures then it sends a command to those eight bolts that hold the solid rocket boosters to the mobile launch platform and the bolts that hold the external tank vent arm to the tank
and the two orbiter umbilicals that says fire the nuts we're going to go
and that is orchestrated by the onboard computers
and when that happens you're flying you're going
the command to ignite the igniters on the solid rocket motors is sent at that time also by the onboard computers within a couple of milliseconds
so all that happens at once
and it's an onboard automated thing
i talked about the human factor that repeatability is important
and i mentioned i gave the engineers you know i always threw rocks at them because they always want to change things
it is the launch director's responsibility to manage
they're the owner so to speak of the launch count procedures the five thousand pages of documentation and the five hundred or so software programs that are executed in the launch count process
and we discouraged changes to that for obvious reasons
unless there is a modification to the flight hardware or the ground hardware or we found something in our previous launch attempt that said we need to fix this or there's an opportunity to increase the margins we don't change it
we try to maintain the procedure and the hardware the way it always has been
and it essentially is
we do training obviously but we train for the nonstandard work
just like in the flight team we have a simulation supervisor that throws diabolical failures out there and we have computer programs and into the control center we bring the launch team power up the consoles
and their displays look like the shuttle is at the pad and it is getting ready to launch and we throw failures at them to test their reaction and to find bugs in our safing procedures
and we've done that over the years
i think the next generation of vehicles will probably have more automation
and that will probably be a better thing but you will never take the console operator out of the control center either the launch control center or the flight control center
you need the person there to disposition the problems but predictability is what we're always after
and stable procedures be they flight or ground give predictable results
and that is why we automate
and we control change too
responsibility
i talked about the engineers
i didn't mention i don't think technicians and inspectors
but when a technician stamps a procedure that i torque that bolt and the inspector stamps that same procedure and said i saw him torque that bolt that is their warranty that that event really happened
and that paper trail and that warranty is very important
when an engineer signs a procedure that tested the flight control system that said i reviewed all the data didn't see any glitches everything met specifications that signature is his or her warranty that the procedure ran correctly and that they understood the requirements that were implemented by that procedure
and the requirements were met
and that is important
our whole concept of launch readiness is based on people being responsible for their system
be it the designer that signs it that says there is nothing going on offline there are no faxes out there that say there is a cloud over the tires
or my last test of the main engines at stennis there was nothing there that says these three engines that are on this orbiter shouldn't work just fine
and they do that in a flight readiness process
that is their warranty and responsibility
and we hammer this home
and it probably comes from i had this quote in my office for years and i am going to bore you with it and maybe some of you can guess where this came from
responsibility is a unique concept
it can only reside in here in a single individual
you may share it with others but your portion is not diminished
you may delegate it but it is still with you
you may disclaim it but you cannot divest yourself of it
even if you do not recognize it or admit its presence you cannot escape it
if responsibility is rightfully yours no evasion or ignorance or passing the blame can shift the burden to someone else
and this is what we push home
and by the way this quote was admiral rickover who was testifying before congress after the first nuclear submarine accident
and he was saying i am responsible
it is my program it is my submarine i am responsible
even though somebody else was commanding it it doesn't matter i am responsible
and we impress that on the managers the engineers the technicians the inspectors you know you're important
and the work you do is important
and when you sign or stamp that procedure or give a go on the net that is your warranty that everything is working and you understand the requirements
very important in the business that we're in
decision making
on the chart
this structure has been in place since the mercury program
there is nothing new here
and the only issue comes in when there is a gray area
who makes the call and how much judgment is involved in the call
and i gave you the example of weather
everybody has an opinion on it
it can be judgmental
well the weather decision is if it is launch weather related it is the launch director's responsibility to determine if it's good enough
if the flight director has an issue with the return to launch site winds that ultimately is his or her decision
the people may get involved in it and they may have offline discussions with the flight director but it is still ultimately his decision
and that is the way it has to be because they are responsible
this mission management team is not responsible for the go no go decision on weather on launch day
it's the flight director for the flight stuff
it is the launch director for the launch related stuff
and it is set up that way so there is no fuzz on it
other people can have an opinion other people can have input but unless this person up here says launch director we're no go it is the launch director's decision in that case
communication
real important
and i will give you an example of that
apollo thirteen
most of you probably don't remember apollo thirteen but apollo thirteen was like challenger and the columbia except we didn't lose the flight crew
but it was just as disastrous an event
and by all rights the crew shouldn't have made it safety back to earth but thanks to the heroics of the flight crew and the flight team and the timing of when that event occurred they were able to get back home
but that was all caused by activity that was done on the ground well before the launch
and specifically since i was involved in that i remember this like it was yesterday
of course part of that is an old age thing
stuff that happened forty years ago comes in loud and clear
stuff that happened four days ago i have a hard time remembering
but we had a tank in the spacecraft that we ran our simulated launch count
and back then we put propellants in the vehicle all the hazardous stuff and detanks
and we couldn't detank the liquid oxygen out of this tank
they had the fuel cells on the spacecraft
and just a little more history
the tank had been dropped when it was installed back in california but engineers and managers did some tests and some rationale on saying well it's still ok to install it
we got it down the cape
we put the liquid oxygen in it and all the rest of the system
we couldn't get it out of this tank
and after reviewing it they found well the stand pipe in there that is used to drain it on the ground was probably bent or damaged and that's why we cannot get it out
so the managers and engineers got together for a few days and said turn the heaters on in the tank and vent the liquid oxygen off
heat it up and it will boil off as oxygen gas through another loop that takes it through the fuel cells and out vent on the vehicle
use the heaters to go do that
so they developed the procedure and we went on station at night a week after we had the anomaly and turned everything on and turned on the heaters
and it is fine
you can see the liquid is turning to gas and it is coming out
and the console operator in our control room said hey sieck i cannot monitor the temperature in this tank anymore
well why is that
well the range on the temperature is from ambient down to minus three hundred degrees because it's measured in liquid oxygen
and it is upper limits
it started heating up and now i cannot tell you whether it is fifty degrees or three hundred fifty degrees
i said ok stop
so we stopped the test and got all these managers involved including the people that built the tank and say hey we've lost visibility
we're putting energy into this tank that has liquid oxygen in it
we cannot monitor the temperature anymore
the pressure seems to be fine
they said don't worry about it
there is a thermostat in there that is heat sensitive and it will open up the power to the heaters if it gets to some limit in there
just keep your eye on the pressure
make sure the pressure doesn't get too high
well of course the pressure isn't going to get too high because the vent is open
so we said fine
we turned the ground power supplies on and let the thing cook for ten to twelve hours
and what we didn't know was that the thermostat wasn't certified to the voltage we were using from our ground power supplies because we didn't tell them although our requirements allowed it that we cranked the power supplies up to fifty volts
and why did we do that
well the more energy you put into the tank the higher the heaters get and the quicker the liquid oxygen boils off
you know high school physics
but we didn't tell them that
and the people that built the tank and built that thermostat had only certified it to the voltage of fuel cell supply which is half that value
so the thermostat welded together the points did and we had continuous power going on in there for eight to ten hours
it got to eight hundred point nine hundred degrees in the tank
we burned all the insulation off the wires to the fans and the heaters
and from that point on we were just waiting for something to happen to make those wires come together
and if you didn't turn the power on you're going to get a spark in an oxygen tank
not a good thing
well that is what happened a day into the mission when they were heading to the moon
and they turned the heaters and the fans on to stir the cryogenics because they were worried about stratification and zero gravity
and they got the spark and it blew up the service module
the point is that communication we wrote down in our procedures what we did but we didn't communicate that on a real time basis
and although we reviewed the procedures afterward as the rest of the team did the designer who was one thousand five hundred miles away who had approved what we did over an intercom system didn't review our paperwork
you hit that thing with fifty volts it's only certified for twenty five volts even though our requirements allowed us to use fifty volts
it is a case where requirements didn't preclude us from launching hardware then in hindsight was flawed
but on the other hand communication we didn't tell them in real time
and as a result apollo thirteen happened
so i learned that lesson early on
i mean even if you're boring them with what appears to be minutia you're going to tell them everything and document everything
and thankfully they went through our procedures and said well there it is
and i thought we'd get fired
and actually we got patted on the back for documenting what we had done so it made it easier to zero in on the root cause of the problem
and as a result we fixed that and we were able to fly again in a few months as opposed to having to go through a challenger or columbia type of activity
very important
launch fever
the human factor
it is hard to describe what the environment is in the spacecraft a few minutes before launch or in the control room
but there is a lot of tension and there is a lot of energy
and everybody in there for the most part has been awake for the last ten to twelve hours
and they came to work that day or that night with all hopes of safely launching the space shuttle
and they really don't want anything to go wrong with their system or somebody else's system
i mean that's the mood
because if something goes wrong you're going to come back tomorrow or the next day or the next week
so they really want to hear this everybody you know when they do the polls they go go go go
and the hardest thing is saying no when everything sounds like it's go
and there are a lot of times when we've had problems with ground support equipment
it is old
i wish we had all new stuff for shuttle
a lot of this stuff is the same we used on apollo
and in spite of our efforts to maintain it it is all out in the corrosive atmosphere at the launch pad
and that stuff constantly gave us problems
and we would lose some of our redundant systems and some of our primary systems
and more than once in launch count when we'd have a problem out there the team would come to the launch director through that organization chart you saw and say we've got an idea
we think if we patch around this and then hook this up to this and we throw these switches and we get this result that it will be ok and we can go fly without this power supply being active or this purge system operating normally and all these other things that we've got out there
and what you have to do as launch director is say well just sit back and analyze whether or not i mean you rely on your engineers to use their yankee ingenuity to fix a problem but you have to assess whether or not they're literally shot gunning it and coming up with the proverbial quick fix because they want to go home in an hour or so and celebrate a good launch
just like these guys want to get out of those uncomfortable suits they have been sitting in for the last couple hours and either get out of the spacecraft or get up there in zero g
as a launch director you have to assess well ok but is this really the right thing to do or are they working this too hard
if you gave them another twenty four hours to look at the data and think about their approach to a fix would the answer be any different
and there have been a few times when they said well that sounds pretty good right now but i am going to give you another twenty four hours to think about it so we're going to scrub for the day
and you can hear the big groan in the control room
and you can just see it going through their heads well this guy has lost confidence in us
i mean we all came to work we get paid to solve problems and get things done and he is telling us that ain't a good answer that ain't a good fix
so you have to balance that when you're in charge but the real job of the launch director is to say no when everybody else wants to go
that is really what you are there for
because these guys get tunnel vision
they want to go fly
the console operators things are on automatic in that last nine minutes and they just hope they don't get that little red or yellow light on their screen that says hey you better go look at this it isn't working right
the last people you want to ask is it ok to launch is the crew
they'll say yes no matter what is happening
and we do ask them by the way but it is a formality because we know what the answer is
unless he's got a fire extinguisher up there putting out something in the spacecraft he is going to say we're go
and that is also why we put in a rule that says after five minutes for these critical launch commit criteria items the five hundred that you absolutely have to look at and certify you don't proposition us with a change to that after five minutes because we're not going to entertain it
if they're out of limits we're not going today or tonight
it is going to be at least twenty four hours
a long time
but the team that does it i mean they are good they are professionals
and we talk a lot about the apollo program and how great things were back then but i just gave you the example of apollo thirteen
the shuttle team versus the apollo team has a much higher degree of difficulty situation to deal with
there are fewer people on shuttle yet it's a more complex vehicle than the whole apollo system
the saturn five rocket and the spacecraft were simple compared to the shuttle system
and we had twenty five thousand people at the cape in the apollo program flying two to three times a year
and in the shuttle program back in the early ninety s we flew seven times a year with six thousand people with a vehicle that is more complex older
in the apollo program our ground equipment was new and all the flight hardware was new
it wasn't reused
it was fresh out of the box factory pristine stuff
and requirements were easy you know it had to act and look brand new or you replaced it
the shuttle because it is twenty point thirty years old depending on which orbiter and the ground equipment which is thirty to forty years old there are requirements that allow fair wear and tear
the engineers are constantly pushed with is this good enough
these wire bundles are frayed and there are dings in this line and that weld is looking like it has corrosion on it is it good enough
well they are constantly propositioning where back in the apollo program you didn't have to mess with that gray area stuff
it either looked or acted brand new or you replaced it
and replacing it was easy because money was unlimited
as a journeyman engineer on apollo i was told whatever you need you can have
system engineers seek more test equipment you need more technicians to be trained on this over here whatever you need just ask for it
money is not an object
as a manager on the shuttle program when i finally got promoted out of the job i liked to launch director i had to tell the journeymen engineers this is all the money you get for next year
and be real efficient with this and frugal because next year you're probably going to get less
and your strategy and approach to issues is much different if you have those two different environments to deal with
and finally the other thing that shuttle deals with today versus apollo is the acceptance of risk
i mean i already mentioned apollo thirteen
back then if you made a mistake you were patted on the back and told hey nice try
now is there anything that can be done to better enhance your probability of success
whereas in the shuttle program risk aversion in this country i don't want to get started on that tangent is becoming more and more a lifestyle
we don't want to do things we might lose or we might not win or we may not be successful
and risk you know there is less tolerance to it
and when you have a problem like columbia or challenger you get half a dozen boarding parties coming into nasa saying here is what you need to do differently or this is wrong with your agency and this and this and you need to go fix that
and again back in apollo it was what do you need to be successful
much different
and it makes it difficult to operate
bob could you comment upon risk aversion and the launch director and whether there were more aggressive and more conservative people who have had your job
well i would say before i was launch director there was one
and he was more aggressive than i was
he was the console manops person
and he would push and he would push until you would say uncle i surrender or whatever and then he would make a judgment call
i was more conservative than that
i trained the one immediately after me
and he was pretty much the same but he got the highly visible job management say that this guy was good we'll take him away from here and go put him over here managing this large organization and worrying about budgets and contracts
that is the same thing that happened to me
and that's unfortunate but nasa's strongest suit is not succession planning unfortunately
it just isn't
yes
are you saying the shuttle program is too risk averse
because you also said that for example it is your job as launch director to be conservative and to say no when everyone else is saying yes
no i wouldn't say that the shuttle program is risk adverse
i would say our society is risk adverse
and you see some of that permeating into the shuttle program but not to the point where i would say it is detrimental
i mean asking questions digging in to understand what your risks are is an important thing to do
and early in the shuttle program we didn't do that
we had a lot of confidence in hardware after the first few missions
it's just like a new car
you put five thousand miles on it you get the bugs out of it and you fully expect it to last another so many hundred thousand miles
well that was the same expectation in the shuttle program
you fly a few flights and you learn that the tiles really stayed glued to the orbiter and the thermal control system really responds as it should on orbit and managing the temperature and the coolant leaks and that sort of thing
and you build up confidence and you say it should work now
we got the bugs out of it and we can go fly this thing as often as those guys at the cape can turn it around
but what they didn't consider and what all these engineers with all due respect that you heard from that certify their systems they didn't totally capture the environment that the shuttle sees over the long period of time in their initial certification
they didn't capture it
and that environment includes not only what happens in space or the calendar exposure to just time on some of these systems that have soft goods in them for instance o rings and that sort of thing but it is the environment of the cape with people constantly removing hardware disconnecting things moving wire bundles out of the way to get access to this or that other component to implement the requirements that were levied on the cape to do the tests and inspections
and they are very invasive and collateral damage is a way of life when you're crawling around in the orbiter
to put in policy that tries to compensate for the fact that the certification didn't capture that environment that this hardware has seen for the last twenty to thirty years to reduce the unknowns involved in that that is the right thing to do
you're trying to reduce the risk of reflying a very complex vehicle
so that is fine but you take that to a limit
i mean you can talk yourself into never flying which would be pretty easy to go do
and then this recovery after the columbia accident that was starting to happen
the managers because they had this investigation board report that says nasa you've become complacent and overconfident
and by the way in my opinion that is somewhat of a bum rap to say that nasa in general and particularly the shuttle program had fallen into that mode
but to have the pendulum swing the other way to understand what your risks are and then you can have knowledge on whether you decide to accept it or not that is a good thing
what didn't happen after columbia but we did do after challenger is after we understood the root cause of the accident and some of the other factors like communication that we're part of that reviewed all the systems and all the requirements the managers said look we're willing to accept some risk
you people who are responsible for these systems and these processes at the cape you need to quantify that for us and bring it to us
and we will either say ok we won't accept that you go back and change your system or change your limits or do more tests or whatever or we will accept it
we will say we'll accept that risk management will accept some risk
that happened after challenger and we were able to fly again roughly two years later after we recertified the design to the solid rocket motors
that didn't happen after columbia
and you can speculate whether or not we could have flown six months ago or a year ago or we should have waited longer to fly because we still had a piece of foam come off the tank
you could debate that
but management never acknowledged that they were willing to accept some risk after columbia
they did say tell us what the risk is but we really want you to crank it down to zero
we don't want to take any risk unlike challenger
now is that bad
see what really happened with columbia was the mission management team's discipline had eroded
there were communication issues
and if you're a student of that investigation they didn't grade out very well
but the investigation said there is complacency and overconfidence in the system
well having been part of the system prior to my retirement five years ago you never found any complacency or overconfidence with the engineers technicians inspectors or the managers that i knew
now they weren't as smart as they thought they were or in some cases as smart as they needed to be
but that is not the same as complacency or overconfidence
because the latter to me implies an attitude problem that i've got it i know it all i am smart as i need to be
and for the most part you know there were some people i didn't like because i thought he or she was arrogant or something like that but i never sensed an attitude problem with the shuttle team
from the technicians many of which i knew and grew up with to the top managers in the shuttle program i never sensed that
but were we not as smart as we thought we were or as smart as we needed to be
were there signs that there was something going on here that you ought to go fix
yes
but again they didn't just blow off so to speak these problems we were having with foam on the tank and these other systems which to me would have been complacency or overconfidence
anything else
we're just about out of time
i've got two announcements
i've been working with the stellar people
as you know some of the pdf files that i've tried to load didn't load
they cannot really figure out why but i have sent them the files they've loaded most of them on so hopefully almost everything is there
we're continuing to work at it but hopefully all the things that you need access to you can find
i said there were two things but that's the only one i remember
well let me close with one note then
i am glad you're here
thanks for your choice to pursue an engineering career
doing things that are hard i have found that in my travels that unfortunately there are fewer people deciding to pursue the tough curriculums and the occupations that require a lot of work and have some risk associated with them
but it is encouraging to see people in graduate school that want to do what i did
i am not sure how much engineering i did in my forty year career
i did a lot of managing and a lot of other assignments but i am sure you can accomplish a lot
i had a grandmother who was born at the end of the nineteen th century
and when she was your age there weren't any computers airplanes cars tv and that sort of thing
yet in her lifetime she got to see her favorite grandson bobby help put a man on the moon
and i don't know what can be done in your lifetime but you can make great things happen with the career you have chosen
so thanks for choosing really
bob thanks very much
a pleasure
professor sheila widnall
we are really lucky that she is able to come and talk to us today
she has been here at mit since one thousand nine hundred sixty four as a professor and then as provost but she didn't serve very long as provost because she was assigned to go to washington by the president to be the secretary of the air force which she did for almost five years i guess
four years
then came back here
and she is now an institute professor which basically means you can do anything you want right including come and talk to our class
in particular professor widnall was on the columbia accident investigation board
and that specifically is what she's going to talk to us about today along with just general comments about how this relates back to systems engineering the design operation of the shuttle and basically anything else that you would like to say because it is your time
so thanks for being with us sheila
ok
well thank you jeff
as i understand the schedule
it is two hours
and if i don't finish we still take a break
and then we come back and finish is that right
generally the way we've run the classes is that we encourage students to ask questions while you're talking
absolutely
that will probably slow me down a little bit
up to you
anyway two hours we'll just take it as it comes
ok
well i am going to focus on the columbia accident investigation
i must say and i'm sure i will say many times as i go through it that it was an incredible experience to be a member of that board two point zero i get chills up my back when i see that
the reason i show this is for two reasons
first of all i mean it was in fact an incredible event
i am sure that all of you can remember where you were that morning when that happened
i also show it because of the expression on the face of the principal mission controller
leroy cain when he realized that the shuttle was lost
and if the shuttle doesn't make it to cape kennedy more or less on schedule there is no engine at that point you've got a problem
and so he was in a windowless box in houston
and so he had no kind of external although all the citizens of texas knew what had happened the guys in the windowless box did not
so it was really an incredible emotional experience for all of nasa as an agency
but then what happens after that
well fortunately the challenger commission had anticipated the need for a method to call an accident board into being if there should be another shuttle accident
and so there were individuals who were more or less ex officio by rank or title waiting to be called
so the fact of the matter is that on saturday when this all happened the accident investigation board was pretty much called into being at that point
now who were the accident investigation board at that point
well they were primarily government employees
not so much nasa employees
that clearly would have been unacceptable
but they were military
three air force generals the head of air force safety a general from space command and a general from material command who had actually served as an executive staff to the challenger commission
that would be general barry
so they had some very good experience
the board was chaired by admiral hal gehman who had been the vice chief of naval operations
he had also been the chairman of the cole investigation
i don't remember how many of you remember the cole investigation but there was a big explosion
it is in the middle east
i don't remember
where was it
yemen
it was probably yemen killing nineteen people
and there were other government employees
somebody from the national transportation safety board
jim hallock who is across the street here at the department of transportation the head of nasa ames and the head of navy safety admiral turcotte
it was a smaller board than it ultimately ended up being
five thirty and i'm blanking on names because i am at that sort of age but we had a nobel prize physicist from stanford
you have to have a nobel prize physicist on a shuttle investigation
also somebody who had been looking into issues of policy and history with respect to the shuttle program
and i am not getting any of these names right so i'm not even going to try
pardon
the class has met john logsdon
john logsdon right
thank you john logsdon
doug osheroff was the stanford physicist
he was kind of a kick because at the beginning he was very media shy
he just wouldn't talk to the media but then he really got into it and he went way outside the box which was kind of interesting to see how that all happened
in any case we were all pulled together and we were chartered to uncover the facts as well as the actual or probable cause of the shuttle mishap and recommend preventative and other appropriate actions to preclude the recurrence of a similar mishap
yes
professor widnall before you and sally ride came on there were no females
that's right no women
i'm not sure
maybe a little bit
but actually the day of the accident of course everybody was saying what happened
that's not what i was saying
i was saying i wonder who is going to be on the board
i actually had a strong sense that i in fact would be on the board
think about it
gene covert had been on the challenger
i think like you have to have nobel prize physicist from stanford you have to have an aeronautical engineer from mit
i think the other thing was as secretary of the air force i was really in charge of accident investigation
all accident investigations reported to me
well you guys don't know a lot about accident investigations in the military
but there are two accident investigations in the military
one called a safety investigation which is privileged and you take testimony and you seal it
and i will talk about that later because we tried to replicate some of that on the columbia investigation
you have that one and then you have the public investigation which you take testimony people can be court martialed
there is an accident investigation procedure that goes on in the air force and i had really been in charge of that
in addition to be an aerodynamicist which is always good i was the aerodynamicist on the commission i was a faculty member at mit i had been secretary of the air force
i had been in charge of accidents
also i had spent my last five years really being interested in space safety and mission assurance in space
i mean all these things kind of came together
sally ride was obvious
she was an astronaut
and she had been a member of the challenger investigation board
she brought that historic knowledge
i don't think that was the primary thing but it is probably good to have a balanced group
see i actually did come on board pretty much february eighteen th
that was when i came
i think that one of the early issues that we faced was our relationship with nasa
i think at the very beginning nasa had this image that we would work for them
that was one thing
and the second thing was that we would find the widget that failed and then we would leave leaving them to carry on
not with this group of people you don't do that and not in this situation
we very clearly and fairly early established our independence
we removed a number of senior nasa people from inline responsibility for the investigation like ralph rowe
again i'm blanking on these names but the people who had been in charge of the program
of course some of them quit even before we got there
linda ham was right in the middle of things
and we just said look we're not questioning your integrity but you just cannot investigate yourself so we need to move you aside
go back to your normal responsibilities and bring in independent people who had not been so deeply involved
and they will be the primary interface between the accident investigation board and nasa because we really needed to use nasa
i basically had very strong interactions with the nasa aerodynamics division
and you will see the reasons why as we proceed
but at the end of my interaction with them which occurred at the end of june and they presented their four hundred fifty page report to me with all the calculations and studies and things that they had done at my direction i basically looked to the group and said well i think i could probably give twenty two phds at this point to this group
because we had really pressed the envelope in terms of improving the methodology that we used to analyze some of the details of kind of what i'm going to talk about
but in any case the issue of independence was extremely important
and i recall a lot of meetings with a lot of banging on the table and yelling and screaming before we finally got this all straightened out
admiral gehman was an incredible leader
he really just did such good work
he had a sense of where to press and where to stay on pad and how to interact
he really was a marvelous chairman
incidentally he recently served on the brac commission so he is somebody who is deeply involved in public service
and i know from my conversations with him that he is a person who refuses to serve on any board of directors that has anything to do with the department of defense because he does not want to give the appearance of a conflict of interest
and he is just a man of incredible integrity
obviously i am a big fan
in any case we proceeded then to wrap our group together and begin our interactions with nasa twelve point thirty and i will show that a couple of times
and this happened in about eighty one seconds two seconds after launch
i don't remember the mach number but i think it was something like two point two five something like that
this is the video
and you see the piece coming off and smashing
and i will show it again
that video was pretty much available the weekend of the launch
there was an understanding among senior program managers that there could be a problem
now what did we know about it
well there were video cameras at the site
there was a video camera located here a video camera located here
a rather shallow angle to try to do any triangulation
but obviously you use what you have
and so as a result of triangulated these two video cameras we were able to make an estimate
it's probably also worth mentioning that there were other video cameras but they were out of order
right
and i was going to talk about that with respect to our recommendations
one of our recommendations was that working video cameras were an absolute necessity for launch
in other words you do not launch if you don't have a reasonable set of video cameras
and by the way you don't launch at night because then obviously the video cameras would not be any good
that was one of our recommendations what i would call a near term recommendation return to flight recommendation
yes
i don't know the answer to that
maybe you know the answer to that
it is very interesting because i have been doing a lot of mission assurance and space accident stuff
you almost always have a picture of a space accident mostly because they occur on launch
so in the case of the challenger we had excellent video
we could see the little hole in the challenger
we could see the stuff coming out
in this case we had reasonable video of potential impact
you can launch with an eight thousand foot ceiling
in which case we would not have seen the challenger
yeah at that point
i don't think it's true now
and i don't know how they followed up on that but there is also a possibility of using aircraft if they cannot get the video
in any case it turns out to be an important issue
and we made recommendations
what we knew about the impact was we figured of course you guys all know exactly what this is
this is the left wing underside
this is where the curvature changes and so it was kind of right in here some place what we refer to as panel seven panel eight panel nine of the underside of the composite material that surrounds the leading edge
now i don't know if you guys have studied that composite material
it is a truly marvelous material
and i may say a little bit more about it
so we sort of knew where the impact had occurred
obviously we were hampered by the shallow angle of the video but this was our best estimate
the velocity was estimated to be roughly eight hundred feet per second
and that was obtained from several different methods
one was a computational fluid dynamics calculation of how would the airstream accelerate a piece of foam of that particular shape weighing two pounds and having it hit
and the other thing was from the video itself
we had pretty good correlation between the estimates based on the video and the estimates based on calculations using computational fluid dynamics so we felt pretty comfortable about this velocity
what did we know
when i joined the board what did we know
what kind of data did we have
well this particular vehicle had some telemetry of some sensors in the wing and in other places
at this point in the investigation we had not recovered the flight data recorder
the other thing that is interesting is that this is the only vehicle with a flight data recorder
this is the vehicle that was considered to be a research and development vehicle
all the other vehicles were operational
they did not equip them with flight data recorders
now i will get back to this point when i talk about the criticisms that we had of the agency
but we took strong exception to the notion that the shuttle had be declared to be operational
and therefore there was no need to continue to study it as a research and development vehicle
it was just like a piper cub or a seven hundred forty seven
that takeoff was a routine event and was not in fact a major event
and even in this system if a sensor failed in the flight data recorder it was not replaced
so what we had on the columbia was a wasting asset but at least we had an asset
we had a flight data recorder
at this point we had not found it
where were these sensors located
well there were a lot of sensors in the wheel well
there were some temperature sensors in this region of the leading edge
there were some temperature sensors back in here and different places
now one thing that is significant about this is that these temperature sensors were connected to two different boxes
actually it looks like three but what i'm going to focus on are these wires
some of the temperature sensors were connected to wires that were basically in this region and running along the wheel well nineteen point thirty that's one of the reasons why that was important and kind of how we began to hypothesize what had gone wrong
now you see the time was sort of eight point forty four
that is eastern standard i think
i was shopping actually at the time
between eight point forty four and nine point zero is when all of this took place so we're talking about fifteen minutes of problems
at eight point forty four everything was fine and at nine point zero the vehicle had crashes twenty point thirty why did these sensors fail first
it was because the wire that controls these sensors is located here in this sort of critical area so that was the wire cutting
yes
you said the other orbiters don't have flight data recorders
right
commercial that's a whole different mindset
yeah
i mean those carry people and it is an faa regulation twenty one point thirty that the wires were being cut
and so we could follow the failure of these sensors right up to the point when the vehicle we had loss of signal which was at about eight point fifty nine
this whole thing happened fairly rapidly of course and this was the trajectory of the vehicle
i will show another picture but the whole problem sort of started off hawaii and then the vehicle began to break up here in texas
this was kind of what we knew on roughly february eighteen th
in fact that's all we knew really
i mean the temperature increases were not particularly dramatic you know fifty degrees thirty degrees
that's not really interesting
what was interesting is the wires were cut
that was more interesting
ok
we began to look for the debris
we had people essentially marching over the state of texas about that far apart
it was an extremely expensive thing but we recovered about forty percents of the material that came from columbia
and of course it is all these little pieces of stuff that fell on the ground
fortunately it fell in a fairly rural area
nobody was hurt
i don't think there was any damage to structures or anything like that
and we were able to recover a great deal of it
a lot of it because i actually looked at the weather radar was very small particles that actually floated into the gulf of mexico
i mean you could see it on the weather radar the nexrad system
you guys all know what the weather radar is
but you could see the particles streaming into the gulf of mexico
i think a lot of it was just sort of vaporized
and there is a footprint of the debris
and we did a lot of searching in that area
we tried to search upstream
we were really trying to find the earliest pieces of debris but these fell down onesies and twosies in really strange places like in mountains in utah and stuff like that
so we were never really successful although some of these had been tracked on radar by the faa
and there is the debris collection a hanger down at kennedy
this is pretty standard stuff for a commercial aircraft i think you all know that
when you have an accident what you try to do is recover the debris and reconstruct the vehicle
this debris was particularly interesting
and i don't know if i have a graph later but let me talk a little bit about the temperatures involved
we're talking about reentry of a damaged vehicle at mach twenty five
now of course that is the course that i tried to get out of when i was a graduate student was that high temperature stuff where the gas begins to ionize and dissociate and you know all that enthalpy stuff
i really tried to avoid that so i got paid back
anyway that is the subject of high speed gas dynamics
and so i had to take a refresher course
and judd barren one of our faculty members was extremely helpful
i used to go over to his house on saturdays and he would give me references
but roughly speaking if the gas didn't dissociate the temperatures on reentry at the leading edge of this vehicle would give off fifty thousand degrees fahrenheit which is really pretty hot
the fact that the gas does dissociate ionization at this mach number is not that important
it interferes with the radio signals but does not in fact absorb a lot of energy
the gas is slightly ionized one percents something like that two percents but not enough to be a big energy issue
but the dissociation of oxygen dissociation of nitrogen is an extremely important phenomenon
and because of that the gas temperature is roughly ten thousand degrees fahrenheit which is a lot better than fifty thousand degrees fahrenheit
so that makes a big difference
let's talk about the leading edge material
the leading edge material is in fact an incredible material
it is a carbon carbon composite material
it is about a quarter of an inch thick and it can withstand a temperature of three thousand two hundred degrees fahrenheit
and the shuttle was conceived in what are we talking about here seventy
yeah sixty nine seventy
we don't have much better materials today
we might be able to go to three thousand four hundred degrees fahrenheit instead of three thousand two hundred degrees fahrenheit so we've made some progress but this is a marvelous material
now how in the world with the gas temperature of ten thousand degrees fahrenheit can you use a material of three thousand two hundred degrees fahrenheit
well that's the other part that i tried to avoid as a graduate student
it is called radiation
and what is it
the stefen boltzmann law of radiation t to the fourth
and you could write it down on the back of an envelope and you can calculate it
and it turns out that the gas coming in does heat the leading edge up but then the leading edge radiates out the right amount of energy to basically have an equilibrium temperature of the order of magnitude of say two thousand eight hundred degrees or maybe three thousand degrees
it is comfortable below its maximum temperature but this is obviously a very dangerous situation
in the early days of the shuttle program they made some tests of this material its ability to withstand impact
they shot bbs at it and made quarter inch holes in it
and then i'm a little fuzzy on this part
they may have tested those quarter inch holes in an arc jet to see would they ablate how would they behave and would they grow
and i think at that point they felt comfortable that they could withstand the impact of a bb and not be destroyed
so that is an important set of issues
i guess the other thing i want to point out is if you have a good solid continuous edge you can support a temperature of three thousand two hundred degrees because of radiation
but if you get a hole in that leading edge then the gas that goes into the cavity behind the leading edge is your old friend ten thousand degrees
but there is no radiation balance to bring you back down to three thousand two hundred degrees so you have a seven thousand to ten thousand degree arc jet coming through any major size hole in the leading edge of the shuttle
and that is of course exactly what happened
and to remind people ten thousand degrees is the surface temperature of the sun
oh it's very hot
yes
there is no material that will withstand this
and this happens routinely in shuttle operations is that the shuttle reenters at mach twenty five and the temperatures of the gas surrounding the shuttle are about ten thousand degrees
and we've successfully gone through how many shuttle flights in total one hundred fourteen
it's a sporty course
now i want to talk about something else we knew before we found the flight data recorder
and this was of great interest to me for lots of different reasons but one of the things we were able to do is infer the aerodynamics of the damaged vehicle by looking at what the flight control system had to do in order to keep the shuttle perfectly on its pre assigned flight path
in other words until very late in the flight the shuttle was doing exactly what it was programmed to do
but it was working a lot harder and in very off nominal ways
and we had to back this out
now this is almost like a zero over zero calculation so it's a little sensitive a little hard to do but this was something the aerodynamics group did
and i worked really closely with these guys
i have great admiration for them
they were able to back out the off nominal roll moments and the off nominal yaw moments of the shuttle during this final reentry
and i made this little schematic of kind of where were they when some of these things happened in terms of the coast of california and their flight over new mexico and down to loss of control over texas
before i do that let me just add to my previous remark that you almost always have a picture of a space accident
now normally that's because space accidents occur on launch
this is a remarkable photo of a space accident
this photo was taken by modestly my guys at kirtland air force base
and basically they had been working with optics
that is basically their business
and so saturday morning ibm personal computer fooling around with some little telescope that they had been developing for tracking things thirty two point zero yeah this is interesting
this is a bulge at the leading edge showing some distortion of the shock shape due to vehicle damage
and i obviously consider this photo to be extremely probative
and also there is a small amount of debris that has got some optical signature to it that is sort of streaming out of that general area indicating i mean there are all sorts of things going on in this vehicle but one of the things that was going on was the melting of aluminum the vaporization of aluminum and the combustion of aluminum because aluminum will burn
i don't know how many of you know it but aluminum is something you add to rocket engines in order to get higher temperatures
it burns when it gets hot enough
it can be a very dangerous material
in any case we suspect there was a lot of aluminum combustion going on while this thing was happening
had there been for reference any similar photographs
no
so we didn't have a nominal baseline
no as far as i know
i actually don't know the answer to that question
i know because i know the guys who took the photo and i know their boss that they were doing it for a very specific reason that had nothing to do with anything they had done in the past
they were trying to develop a little telescope to track things because that's what they do at kirtland is they work with optics
but i don't know whether anybody has tried to do it
i suspect their level of precision is a little greater than the average citizen trying to take a picture of the shuttle coming in
but this was not a really high powered telescope
i mean they had some really high powered telescope at kirtland
this was just a small one
anyway i don't know the answer to that
well i think what we're looking at here is the glowing of this ten thousand degree envelope that surrounds the shuttle
that is what we're looking at is we're looking at the radiation basically from the gas surrounding the shuttle
it was normal
but of course this was eight point fifty in the morning boston time
this is february so it probably was dark in new mexico
that is kind of the picture that we go which i think is really neat
this is the trajectory but this is the backing out of the off nominal moments
now let me talk about the yaw moments just to give you a feeling for what does all this mean
i contend that off nominal aerodynamic forces are an indication of external damage to the vehicle
that is basically what it is
the vehicle was flying because its reaction jets were moving and doing all sorts of things
the aerodynamic surfaces were virtually useless at these dynamic pressures
this was a reaction jet controlled vehicle but we knew how much force the reaction jets were putting out so we could do the vehicle aerodynamics
let me talk about the yaw moment
what we have here is that as the accident began the yaw moment became negative kind of flattened out for a little while and then became very strongly negative
what is yaw moment
yaw moment is the force turning the vehicle this way
if i have a damaged left wing what is my yaw moment going to be and why
well i'm going to have increased drag on this wing because i've got a big chunk out of the leading edge i've got a disturbed shock i've got all sorts of stagnation pressure in this region where in normal circumstances it would be smoothly flowing
i've got increased drag on this wing and so that's going to drive me this way which is exactly what you see
that is off nominal yaw moment
roll moment is a little stranger
basically as the drag increases and you probably lose lift so your roll moment begins to go like that you have decreasing roll moment
this was a bit of a mystery because basically what it said is you lose roll moment but then all of a sudden your roll moment increases
that is a problem that only an aeroelastician could solve
i happened to be an aeroelastician
do you know what i'm talking about
if you stick your hand out of the car window and you turn it slightly what happens
it goes up
and it may also turn some more
in other words if you lose the leading edge spar of a wing you lose its resistance to torsion
now we don't have all the data we need to prove that that's what was going on
but i believe a strong hypothesis that we lost the strength in the leading edge spar and the leading edge spar tipped up
and obviously the lift would increase because the angle of attack was increasing
but this was a very very puzzling and very interesting phenomenon
but in any case what happened is that both the roll moments and the yaw moments got too strong for the control system of the vehicle which again was just the reaction control jets that are on the area around the vertical tail
then ultimately the thing went into a spin lost control and then of course the vehicle was lost began to break apart
this was a very interesting set of data
and as i say when we started this was pretty much all we had
there was a pivotal moment and it occurred sort of at the end of march about march twenty seven th
remember the accident occurred february one st
we found the flight data recorder
and we found it by these guys walking across the field looking for stuff
and the flight data recorder was found
and it was in pretty good condition considering it had done a reentry at mach twenty five
we were able to recover the data from the flight data recorder
i think we pretty much got it all
at that point we had hundreds and hundreds of data points
and i would say at this point nasa's attitude changed
i think up until this point there had been a certain level of denial about the accident about what caused it
maybe it was a micro meteorite
maybe it was some unexplained system failure
they were not really sure that we were pursuing the right road until the flight data recorder was found
and i think maybe that's to nasa's credit
nasa is data driven
and when they began to see the data and they began to see how well the data correlated with the hypothesis and the models then they hopped right onboard and did a tremendous amount of work to try to help us unscramble all of this and come to a hypothesis
what kind of data did we have
well this is a picture of the leading edge spar this big thing here
and this is a picture of the hypothesis sort of about a piece of foam taking out a fairly large piece of this carbon carbon fiber and allowing hot gas to enter into the region behind the leading edge
this leading edge region is as you can see by the picture sort of hollow
there isn't anything back there
there is a layer of insulation covering this but that is because of the radiation
in other words because this in fact is three thousand two hundred degrees
it radiates in both directions
and so there is a layer of insulation here to protect against radiation
but that insulation will not protect against the equivalent of an arc jet
that is just again burrowing and blasting it
it was fairly quickly that this gas just blew a hole through the leading edge spar
how did we know that
well it's kind of interesting
let's look at one of these
we had all these wires back here
and we had these temperature sensors
let's just pick one temperature sensor
i didn't even know where it was located but it was not located in this region
it was located back someplace else
so we looked at the temperature sensor and compared it with earlier flights where the earlier flights would show this behavior and this temperature sensor kind of did this
it began to go up and then all of a sudden we lost it
what happened
forty two zero the picture begins to emerge of wire bundles being cut of gas entering here of this wire bundle being cut to the sensor of this in fact entire region beginning to sort of fill up with extremely hot gas seven thousand degrees roughly eventually entering the wheel well although that was later in the flight
we did have some indication of the gas in the wheel well because of the temperatures and the loss of sensors
because of this the focus turned to the question of this what we call rcc which is this composite material that surrounds the leading edge
and where did we find it
and we found a lot of it
i mean we found it all along in texas
the other thing we were able to look at with respect to the rcc is its pattern of erosion
i mean this rcc was kind of flopping out in the breeze here at roughly seven thousand to ten thousand degrees
and so it was a material that was being effectively subject to an arc jet
and if you took a material like that and stuck it in an arc jet it probably would ablate and it would maybe sharpen up and you'd have maybe little pointy edges where it had ablated
and so we looked at the part that was particularly eroded
and that would be the yellow stuff
and we found that upstream of the stuff that was more put together the rest of the rcc from the wing
and from the right wing we found the right wing downstream of the left wing which means that the left wing came off first
now the image that emerges from this is hole in the leading edge material coming off but gas flow going down this what some people called the chunnel i never liked that term but it's a big open cavity
gas flowing down this open cavity and simply destroying all the fittings that held the rcc onto the wing
i mean the screws and the brackets and all of that
and again gas is coming in
and the wing just unzips
all this stuff just kind of unzips and falls off
and of course that is where we find it just lying on the ground
it all unzipped and fell off
what did we actually find forty five point thirty what we had to do however is to construct analysis using a whole lot of different disciplines
and we had to be able to analyze according to the rules of that discipline and line them all up for consistency
and i would say that we never found a theoretical or experimental result that was in conflict with our basic hypothesis
and that everything sort of lined up
i was more or less in charge of the aerodynamic analysis as well as my favorite subject thermodynamic analysis
i never liked that part either but the whole question of heat transfer and how fast these materials would melt i was pretty much involved in that
i may have another picture later but let me just show you some pictures that we had
there is a hypersonic wind tunnel down at langley
and we did a lot of tests in that wind tunnel
one of the things we did was we had a score of wind tunnel models
they were about this big
but we took chunks out of their leading edge
we have our wind tunnel model which was the nominal shuttle
and then we'd have a nominal shuttle with panel six missing and then a nominal shuttle with panel seven missing and a nominal shuttle with panel eight missing forty seven point thirty and then you see the green
that is probably a little intermediate temperature
and then you see the blue
that is probably lower
but if you look at this being an aerodynamicist i can tell you where that vehicle gets hot
it gets hot near stagnation points and near leading edges
and especially at the stagnation point on the vehicle
you can put a wind tunnel model like that in a hypersonic tunnel painted with this special paint and you can take pictures of it and you can get that temperature distribution
here is my little figure of aerodynamic forces
we had all sorts of data from both the flight data recorder and the telemetry that gave us a pretty good indication of the timeline
if any of you ever want to come into my office i have this enormous poster
it's like ten feet long which basically shows the timeline of the shuttle reentry with all kinds of the individual data bits the temperature distributions and all the things that kind of we could fit on this enormous poster
that is kind of what we were trying to do
we looked at the debris
we looked at forensic analysis of the debris
where was it ablated
what was its chemical composition
did we see melted incanol
i mean we saw all these things and were able to figure it out
well we knew what temperature incanol melts at so therefore the temperature on this particular piece was i don't know what the temperature of incanol is but let me say one thousand two hundred degrees
it would be that kind of material forty nine point thirty and you don't replace this material
this material is the same material that was used on the original shuttles
every time it flies it loses a little bit of stuff through vaporization
and so then they kind of tried to paint it again but i think our hypothesis is it just gets weaker and weaker as it is being used
and the problem is it is hardly being made anymore
it is material that was all made at the beginning of the program
it is not being made anymore
it is very expensive
it is not a material that is easy to get
and in fact that became an issue for us because one of the things i will show is we wanted to do a full scale mockup of the leading edge and we wanted to test it with a piece of foam going eight hundred feet per second
now why would we want to do that
well that is exactly the test conditions that we wanted to simulate
well that is not only expensive but this material just doesn't exist
i don't remember where we got the material
we probably took it off of endeavor or something like that
but i mean this was a big deal that we should run this test because the material is very precious
but anyway we banged on the table and said that we were going to do this and that they had to support us
we did the wind tunnel test
i have a question about that test
yes
my reaction as an outsider when they published the pictures of the holes on that test was wow
wow
that was my reaction too
yeah my reaction was wow
fifty one thirty anyway we did the tests and we studied timelines we conducted arc jet tests we did forensic analysis of debris both chemical and sort of physical
we did a lot of different in depth analysis
the test itself in addition to being expensive and working with material that was really hard to pull together enough of this material to run the test was also emotional
it was also an emotional event for the people involved
and just very late in the game nasa said we are prepared to accept that the foam put a hole in the leading edge so don't run the test
and we said well you may be prepared to accept his but somewhere down in your organization is someone who doesn't believe that and this test is for him
i actually met that guy
i mean there are people in nasa who do not believe this
so maybe what makes sense is let me show the movies and then we will have our break
here is the wow
can i hear it from the class
wow
and this really was
i mean the guy who developed this material and as i say i have great respect for that material fifty three point thirty let me go inside
this is inside
they had a camera mounted inside
that is kind of gee whiz thing because you can see the deformation before it breaks
was this done in the wind tunnel
no this was a full scale mockup that was done at southwest research institute
we had a big mockup of the vehicle
it was done outside
southwest research has been involved in the shuttle program for quite a while
they have a foam gun that they have used to shoot foam primarily at the underbody tiles
the concern has always been on the strength of the tiles
do you guys know what the tiles are
the sort of foam stuff that is underneath the vehicle
they have done a lot of tests on foam
not big pieces of foam but sort of small pieces of foam
never tested the leading edge because it is damn expensive to test this leading edge material
and the only tests i am aware of were these bbs that were shot
this was really the first time this test was done
now let me make a profound comment about space systems
there is a fundamental principle in the development of space systems test as you fly
you all know that
i hope you all know that
this test should have been done at the beginning of the shuttle program
it was not done
and the reason it wasn't done is because there was a requirement in the shuttle program that foam shouldn't come off the orbiter or off whatever that thing is the tank
it was a requirement that foam shouldn't come off the tank so therefore why do the test if it's a requirement that foam not come off
well the fact of the matter is foam has come off on every single shuttle flight as far as we know
so this was a violation of the test as you fly principle
that is i would say the number one principle in the development of space systems is test as you fly
it is the most important thing
anyway we can take our break now
and remember jr thompson's remarks about testing to failure which they did on the main engine didn't do on the srbs and they clearly didn't do here
ok a quick two minute you know the drill
what you see is sort of an aluminum frame
i mean what you have here is really what would be called a full scale mockup
it is an aluminum frame that holds the tile in the right position
and i suppose holds it with fittings of the right strength
in other words what you're trying to do is replicate with what would be called a full scale mockup the structural conditions of the leading edge
you would have fittings holding the panels and then you would have it angled properly to the foam gun which is over here some place and then you fire the foam at eight hundred feet per second
so that's basically the test
and as i say it was done outdoors
it was quite spectacular
a big audience you know there was the media and nasa
a big audience
it was quite an event
as a result of this the committee felt pretty confident that we had identified the technical cause of the accident
when we started this we didn't know how sure we would be so we had all these words like probably more likely than not conceivably
because we needed to think about describing our certainty whether we knew in fact what had happened
but by the time we finished all of this because everything had lined up so well we felt pretty confident that we knew in fact what had happened
and so we all sat down around the table and argued about these words
this was a committee consensus
we voted on every word
well not every word
some of the words are obvious
but we basically came to consensus on every single important word in this statement of technical cause
i will just sort of let you read it because it took us a long time to write
i should mention that one of the things
and i think this was from the flight data recorder
i really have not given you as much data about the flight data recorder
but one of the things we had from the flight data recorder is an indication of conditions on assent relative to earlier flights
and if you look at the conditions on assent you can make a pretty good case that there was a hole in the leading edge on assent after the foam had hit
because you see increased temperatures on the sensor right behind that region of the leading edge
and so you can make a pretty good case that the hole was there on assent after mach two point five or whatever the mach number was
but that was data from the data recorder
i believe it was from the flight data recorder
they didn't get that on telemetry
they did not have that from telemetry
i'm pretty sure about that but i'm not absolutely sure
yes
oh they knew that weekend
oh in fact i'm going to talk about that because that's part of the organizational and cultural issues
finishing the technical cause this was our final statement about the cause of the accident
but we didn't stop there
not this group of people
yes
i was going to ask how soon did you arrive at the hypothesis that the hole led to the gases that led to the
i think pretty quickly
yeah i would say it was pretty quickly
now there was a little pushback from nasa on that
but i described my appearance on february eighteen th on the board and the fact that we had the wire cutting sensor information that we had the video of the foam hitting the shuttle and exploding
in other words there was a shattering of the foam
and we had the aerodynamic forces which indicated damage to the vehicle which were consistent with the wing leading edge
we have a picture from kirtland of some bulging around the wing leading edge
i would think by sort of the third week in february that's where we were headed
now you don't want to get blindsided
sure we don't want to get blindsided
we got lots of inputs from the public as well as from the scientific community
and there was an input we felt we had to take seriously
and i can sort of say what it was
we got an input from sort of solar physicists who said that on that day there was a violent sun episode that would have sent a shower of solar radiation to the earth on that particular day
and that it was possible that this could have created some kind of shockwave in the vicinity of the shuttle and done some damage
i mean it was a credible hypothesis
i called the air force
out at hanscom we have these guys who do basically radiation physics radiation weather space weather
and jim hallock from dot kind of shepherded that part of the project but jim is a physicist
he has a phd from mit and works at the department of transportation
and so the two of us go together and said we have to take this seriously
we have to put an expert team together and completely examine this hypothesis
so we did that
and we had data from all over the world of this radiation coming in and so it was very exhaustive
it turned out that this radiation didn't reach the earth until three point zero pm on that day but we took it seriously
i think that was probably one of the most credible things
we obviously got a lot of junk stuff that it was an israeli plot or something like that
i cannot even remember those things
and then i think there was always this suggestion that it was just a micro meteorite but i think because of the magnitude of the damage and the fact that i think this is general knowledge the air force watches space junk
they have a catalog of everything that is lying up there and there wasn't really a piece up there large enough to do that kind of damage so that was eliminated
there were a number of hypotheses
but again when we did the data we didn't go in with a hypothesis
we went in to see what the data told us
that was a bit of independence with respect to the data and the analysis
yes
no it is melting
no the temperatures
see it's aluminum
eventually
well i think heat was the main culprit
the dynamic pressures and i am sorry i didn't bring the graph in this regime were not that large
i am thinking they were less than one hundred pounds per square foot because you're really up at very high altitude
and even though you're going very fast the dynamic pressures are not that high
i actually have a graph of dynamic pressures
in fact come into my office and you will see the dynamic pressure as a function
i would think the way to think about it is that the important parts melted
see we know from observations and i didn't show all of these but people were recording
i don't remember what we called them but big pieces of the shuttle were coming off
you saw the video with all these pieces flying in but we have pieces coming off as early as california
and i think we hypothesized at one point that the upper wing came off
in other words the upper surface of the wing just lifted off
and the reason it did is not so much from pressure is that all this gas is in there
aluminum melts at seven hundred degrees fahrenheit or some ridiculously low number
we're talking seven thousand degrees fahrenheit so we're talking about destruction primarily by arc jet
you have to think of the atmosphere as a big arc jet
and eventually the vehicle became uncontrollable unflyable because the aerodynamics were so off nominal and the vehicle couldn't be controlled
but again i think the dynamic pressures didn't get larger than two hundred pounds per square foot
i don't think
which is about what i am doing right here
that is about two hundred pounds per square foot
yes
what happened to the crew
i probably don't want to talk about that
we have some information
well let me say what i can say
the vehicle itself stayed intact through a large part of the reentry and got into what would be called the fighter pilot's regime you know fifty thousand feet
the actual cause of the death of the crew was what any fighter pilot would experience if he lost his vehicle at fifty thousand feet
it's blunt force trauma
that is what it was
and we found a lot of the cockpit
reentry is really interesting
there is something called ballistic coefficient
do you know about ballistic coefficient
we found briefcases pillows
ballistic coefficient people talk about it in two different ways and one is the reciprocal of the other
i always get confused about that
but if you have a low ballistic coefficient and you drop a pillow at mach twenty five at four hundred thousand feet it would probably make it to the earth because it will slow down and then it will just gradually float down to earth
we found a lot of the crew compartment a lot of pillows chairs all the stuff that was really light just reentered without burning up because of ballistic coefficient
there was a lot there
sixty nine zero and so that gets into some of your questions having to do with when did they know
and of course the big why question
let me go to that
now i'm going to go off into the second part of our investigation
and we consider this to be as important if not more important than our technical investigation
we talked a little bit about the history of the shuttle program
and i am sure that is something that you have been through in terms of the budgets the margins what we believe is a mischaracterization of the vehicle as a mature operational system
and we think that there is a story here to be told and so we looked into this
now i have to say that i was not as much a part of this as some other members because i was busy on the aerodynamics part of it
but you had john logsdon we had quite a number of the air force people and admiral gehman were more deeply involved in pulling together the sort of history of how this happened the cultural issues
i am sort of reporting on behalf of my fellow board members what our conclusions were and the data that we gathered together to put this together
the things that were pointed out are that there was this fundamental uncertainty in the shuttle program and that led to a sort of fluctuating attitude towards investing in upgrades and infrastructure
the nation didn't really know where it was going
and i hope you won't take offense at this
i worked for nasa
you worked for nasa
we found them to be an extremely insular organization
and i think actually they still are
they don't take advice from the outside
and i will be prepared to admit that they are the only organization that does human spaceflight at least in our nation but they are not the only organization that handles risky technologies
and they have a lot to learn from other organizations
and they have not been a part of that conversation with the type of people like the nuclear navy and some of the commercial industries that use extremely risky technologies
they have not been a part of that dialogue
and that is where we have criticized them
as i say they are insular
they think that they cannot learn anything from anybody else
that they know how to do all these things and that they don't need to accept any external suggestions
that is a very dangerous line of reasoning for an organization really no matter how good you are
so we felt that the people at nasa that leadership clearly believed these things and the people in the engineering workforce were under tremendous pressure to go along in some sense with these basic attitudes
and we saw that in our investigation of kind of the what went on during the flight
i mentioned before that there is this history of foam
and let me introduce the word anomaly
have you talked about anomaly
not directly
ok
anomaly is one of the most important words in space systems
anomaly means that something happened that shouldn't happen
anomaly should bring your organization to a standstill while you figure out what happened and why it happened
anomaly is a violation of requirements
sometimes i think it's a euphemism for failure
well yeah
hopefully you catch it before failure
anomaly is a clue that something may even worse happen down the road
it is something to be taken extremely seriously
foam shedding off the tank was an anomaly
it didn't destroy the vehicle but it is a violation of requirements
and in the early days it was really put on a list of problems to be worked
i mean nasa didn't completely ignore it but they put it on a list of the other five thousand problems that needed to be worked
and they just kept flying until foam shedding really became a normal expectation that all the flights would have foam shedding and that nothing serious would ever happen
it was treated as a maintenance turnaround problem you know when the vehicle gets back we can fix it
and that was true in this case too
they said something like well if foam hits the shuttle we'll fix it when it gets back
i mean that was the stance
now i think what's interesting about this if you think about this is that the anomaly of foam shedding without hurting the shuttle was treated as if it were a planned engineering test
in other words it was a test that was planned to see if foam could hurt the shuttle
and the fact that foam didn't hurt the shuttle was treated as confirmation that foam couldn't hurt the shuttle
now i think that's kind of a fundamental
i like that particular phrase
there was enormous schedule pressure on nasa
they had already slipped a couple of times because of other what i would call strong signals
we use the word strong signals
when something really dramatic is identified nasa shuts down
and i don't remember the issues
there was something about a connector that didn't seem to work properly and it just grounded the shuttle fleet for three months or something
and there was some other problem that was a strong signal and they simply shut it down
the foam we put in the category of a weak signal
it is something that while you're fighting all the strong signals it is hard to justify shutting the organization down for what you perceive as a weak signal
so they had used up almost all of their margin to complete the space station
and they were under tremendous pressure
sean o'keefe was obviously sent to nasa to put the house in order put the schedule and the budget in shape and get this space station finished by february nineteen th
ooh we've already passed that one
we will talk a little bit about what happened on the ground while the vehicle was in the air
i mentioned before that in the military we do two investigations
we do a safety investigation where the testimony is privileged and we do an investigation which is public
and our group was kind of doing both
in other words we were obviously doing a public investigation
we had press conferences every week and the media would come and we'd share everything with them
but because we did have so many military people who understood the importance of accident investigation we also had i don't know an annex i guess you'd call it a way to take testimony and keep it privileged
and we did that
we took testimony from individual people at nasa
it was privileged testimony
and they felt free to share with us their participation and what happened and who said what when and all of that
and we had the damnedest trouble keeping this from congress
i mean it really was
and anything that's written down is accessible to congress at least that's the way they look at it but we really held very firm and we would not allow this privileged testimony to be accessed
and i think the compromise we made was that a staffer could come over to where we were located he could read the testimony and take no notes
well they soon tired of that so the fact of the matter is they didn't come
but we had a lot of privileged testimony that allowed us to put this picture together with employees not being too concerned about the implications of sharing with us
so the weekend that the flight went up nasa knew that there was a potential problem
and they put in place something called the debris assessment team which is supposed to look at all the data that they had and decide whether or not there was a problem
now i've chaired a lot of committees not only here at mit but other places
and i understand how important it is for a committee to have a clear charter and a clear line of reporting and to have a certain level of independence from their home organization
for example if i were chairing a committee here at mit on an important research issue or important policy issue and members of my committee were getting pressure from their department heads i would blow the whistle
i would say that is not the way a committee works
a committee has a charter
it has independence
it is not subject to outside influence from the people to whom these people report in their normal way of life
so with respect to the debris assessment team i would make two comments
first of all they had a very unclear charter
it wasn't clear kind of who they reported to or what their authority was
and they as individuals were getting pressure from their home organization both nasa and the companies the usa lockheed boeing because those guys were getting pressure from nasa
it was just an enormous amount of pressure being applied to various people in what i considered to be a totally inappropriate way
in any case this team i admire them
i mean i think they were doing a good job
they wanted to get on orbit pictures to see whether or not using national assets we could take pictures of the shuttle
and so who do you contact when you want something like that
you talk to the air force
and the air force is of course like a great collie dog just waiting to show what they can do
you know
i mean oh great we've got this wonderful opportunity to take these pictures
it's really going to be fun
we're going to show what we can do
they are very enthusiastic about responding to that kind of request but nasa didn't want the pictures
i mean the senior managers of nasa didn't want the pictures
the debris assessment team did want the pictures
and they tried to make these requests of different parts of the organization
and every time they would make a request it would get slapped down by senior managers
well i guess we have it
this is a highly classified area but let me just say there were eight separate opportunities where we could have gotten some significant information about the state of the shuttle and we didn't do it
we didn't do it because every time there was a flurry of activity around there nasa said they didn't need it
they'd fix the shuttle when it got back
if the damage had been discovered what do you think would have been done
well i can talk to that issue
i mean this is as good a time as any
we actually asked nasa to do some studies about what could have been done
this is a nation that will save a whale that is trapped in the arctic or baby jessica in the well
i mean if we find that there is a crisis we will mobilize
there is no question about it
it would be a very chancy situation
we know the vehicle is destroyed
the vehicle is lost
there is no question about that the vehicle cannot reenter safely with the people
so what was the best option
i mean we looked at the possibility of stuffing the hole with things you know old sleeping bags and suitcases and stuff
there wasn't anything onboard that could have withstood the temperatures
and of course one of our recommendations was that there should be some capability for in flight repair
that has been a big issue
but the only other thing you could do is to sort of go into life support mode
stop doing the science
jettison the module i guess which would make the vehicle lighter and then maybe the reentry would be a little more successful
conserve electricity
conserve water
conserve food
try to stay in orbit for an additional i don't remember the number fifteen point sixteen days something like that so that you could send up a second shuttle
i think it was atlantis
they could get atlantis ready and send it up
it was sort of by chance but it just happened that in this mission they did have the possibility of doing a rescue
right
it's a gutsy move but i have a feeling that if we actually had that information that we could have put that together
it is interesting that when you read some of the stuff that is being talked about like the hubble and things like that we did not recommend that a second shuttle be standing by
but that seems to have been internalized at nasa as a potential safety measure
that they will always want to have a second shuttle standing by if they send the shuttle up
the problem with that is it's a bit of a going out of business strategy because there aren't that many left
yes
we never looked at that option
we simply didn't
this particular vehicle was not in an orbit that could have reached the space station
and that is another big issue is whether you want to have the space station available for a safe house if you have an accident
in this particular case this vehicle could not have reached the space station
soyuz could not have reached this because soyuz launches from fifty one degrees
this was in twenty eight degrees
also remember there were seven people aboard so you would have needed three soyuzs
the russians just don't have them available
it was either atlantis or nothing
larry you had a question
yeah going back to the on orbit photo
it was alleged at the time that the nasa management thought that the quality of the photos was what it had been several years earlier and therefore would not have helped them
let me speak to that because i was going to mention that
in the early days of the shuttle program there was in fact a good interaction between nasa and the national security apparatus that does this sort of work
and people at nasa were cleared to an appropriate level to have this interaction
that has atrophied
the current people at nasa basically have no experience with that world are not cleared to an appropriate level have just not had an interaction and see it as a bigger deal than it really is
it is not a big deal
we do it all the time with my collie dog friend
i mean it's just not a big deal
so our recommendation was that there should be a better interaction between nasa and the national security apparatus
and that the senior people at nasa should be cleared to an appropriate level to have that interaction
and that this should be in fact routine that you always take pictures when the shuttle is in orbit
and so i think that was basically one of our recommendations
in any case we were not pleased with the decision or the failure to take photos onboard eighty six point zero it was called the crater model
its fundamental purpose was to figure out whether foam would hurt the tiles
it was developed as a result of the experiments done at southwest research institute of shooting small pieces of foam at the tiles
not the leading edge but the tiles
and it was sort of all things kind of rolling together
the people who developed this model were in huntington beach california when they transferred the operation to the cape or to houston i don't remember
the senior people in that group refused to move so they turned the tool over to junior people
there was a loss of corporate memory a loss of understanding and so it just got worse and worse and worse
and so finally the people who were applying these tools were not the same people who were in the development of the tool and really lacked understanding of what this tool was all about
the tool predicted that you had a serious problem
but they said oh well the tool always over predicts
they ignored it and said there was no problem
i mean it was just cascading of kind of bad things happening
we talked a little bit about the organization of nasa
and i don't know whether you talked to aaron but this would be a good question to ask aaron cohen
i am setting him up here
about an independent safety organization at nasa
yes
as far as we can tell nothing until about one or two minutes before
actually mission control had arranged for a press conference with the crew in orbit
right
are you going to mention that
i will talk about that
because the crew new that some foam had come off but they were told that it was no problem
yeah but that's different than the crew knowing
right
no i think that is true
that the crew was notified that there had been an incident on liftoff but there was no problem
and the only reason they told them was because somebody from the press might ask them
yeah
and i have had media training so i know exactly what they were thinking about
the shuttle lands the astronauts get out the microphone gets into the mouth and they say do you know
and the astronauts would say of course we knew and we understood it was no problem
i mean it was a pre media sort of skull session for the astronauts as opposed to a more responsible concern
what we do know about the astronauts is we have the voice recording and stuff and i think there was something from mission control to the astronauts saying we see a temperature anomaly in your wheel well
the temperature was fifty degrees higher than would have normally been
and this was literally just like i don't think any more than five minutes before the vehicle lost control
maybe even less than that
i mean it's all in the timeline
and that is probably all i want to say about it
i think the evidence we have seems to indicate that the astronauts knew
obviously when the vehicle went out of control they knew there was a problem when it began spinning and stuff like that
but as far as we know there was no indication prior to that
everything else was sort of nominal
yes
after both shuttle accidents you have investigation boards but what happened after apollo one for example
i don't know the answer to that
well actually that's what aaron did talk about safety organization with respect to that and apollo thirteen and the fact that when it was set up they did start out with a very strong independent safety organization which did not exist before apollo one point ninety thirty now why did we say that
well you're all engineers
the idea behind an independent safety organization is that you should have engineers fighting
how do engineers fight in an ideal world
they fight with data and analysis and hypothesis and testing
in other words if the program wants to waive a requirement change a requirement then they have to present a case
and if the safety organization feels that there is crossing the line then they present a case
and the two organizations basically try to bring together the best analytical and experimental framework they can in order to determine what should be done
and so that's the notion of an independent safety organization
i guess the thing that i was somewhat gratified by we will see how it all works out is that we recommended as a return to flight thing that nasa present a plan for an independent safety organization with the idea that in the midterm they would actually begin such an organization
sean o'keefe took the bit in his teeth i guess is the way to say it and he moved out much more strongly on that than i would have anticipated
we met with him last december
i guess it was december
these years go by very quickly
but he had actually put in place a structure to get ready for the flight that had outside experts from within nasa to sort of come together as an independent safety board to look at anomaly resolution
i guess they didn't do too good on the foam
but in any case as far as the structure goes it was a stronger safety structure than had existed before
that was something that we recommended
it was very important that there be an independence in the safety organization and that this is in fact a characteristic of an organization that effectively manages high risk
and we would claim that there are several such organizations in our country
and there is a lot to be learned and a lot to be shared
we also looked at the comparisons between this accident and the challenger accident
and in fact found more similarity than you might have expected given that challenger occurred on liftoff and this occurred well in reentry but did occur on liftoff
in terms of the role of engineers and technical managers this notion of normalizing deviance
deviance is an anomaly
it is a departure from the requirements
and if you normalize it it means you accept it
you accept it and in fact you try to profit from it by saying that it's proven that there is no danger
so this phrase normalization of deviance is an important sort of technical phrase that our group used
we had with us actually a faculty member from boston college who had written a book on the challenger investigation
she is a social scientist and she worked very closely with us to try to put what i would call the social science and organizational effects together
that is diane vaughn
you might bring her over some time
she is a fascinating speaker
but the thing that was interesting about diane not only was she a great colleague she published her first book on the challenger accident is there's an in depth analysis of the cultural flaws in the organization that led to the challenger accident
she published this book
and she said well you know i got a lot of reaction from the book
she said the navy called my old boyfriend called the various industries called to have her come and talk about safety culture
nasa never called
nasa never indicated any interest in her analysis of the cultural flaws within the organization that led to the challenger accident which i think is another indication of the insularity
that was i think an important input to our look at the organizational issues
we got together as a result of all of this
and as i said i wasn't deeply involved in say some of the privileged interviews having to do with the individuals
but certainly as a board we came to this organizational cause which we considered to be as important as the technical cause
and the various words rooted in the space shuttle program
history and culture
original compromises that were required to gain approval
the years of resource constraints
the fluctuating priorities
the scheduled pressures
this mischaracterization of the shuttle as operational rather than developmental
lack of agreed national vision for human space flight
the cultural traits and organizational practices that were detrimental to safety that we're allowed to develop including reliance on past success as a substitute for sound engineering practices such as testing to understand why systems were not performing in accordance with requirements
organizational barriers that prevented effective communication of safety information and stifled professional differences of opinion
lack of integrated management across program elements and the evolution of an informal chain of command and decision making process that operated outside the organization rules
a bit of an old boy network in some sense
and we should mention the lack of an agreed national vision for human space flight has been the jumping off point for everything that has happened since with the new vision which is presumably going to determine what we do in the next ten years so i think it is great that all of you called attention to that
let me talk about our recommendations
we made recommendations in basically three piles
one of them are the near term recommendations which are the return to flight recommendations
and these were monitored by a committee of twenty eight people
it was enormous
in any case we asked them to present a plan for an independent safety organization
i think they went a little further
we asked that they develop a method to do onboard repair
now there was a big discussion about onboard repair
it is very clear that it is much easier to do onboard repair for all sorts of different reasons including crew safety if you are going to the space station
because then you've got a safe house and all sorts of supplies
it is like your recreation room
if you're not going to the space station it is considerably more dangerous and that is the fundamental issue with respect to a hubble mission
because a hubble mission is incompatible with going to the space station
if you take this recommendation seriously you either have to develop an autonomous onboard repair which is much more difficult than a space station onboard repair or you cannot have any hubble mission
so this is a bit of turmoil in the political issues surrounding missions
the other impacts as i mentioned not our recommendation but this notion of having a second shuttle standing by seems to have been internalized
there were a number of other recommendations
our report is on the web
i mean more video cameras
more onboard video that gets telemetered to the ground during the flight so you don't have to wait until the vehicle gets back to see the video
external video cameras launched during day
keep your sensors up to date
i mean there was just a whole lot of i think twenty five recommendations of a return to flight
and the return to flight committee was in charge of monitoring all of those
and they have recently issued a report
incidentally i got a copy of the return to flight report and donated it to the aerolibrary
it should be in the aerolibrary
and there was a very interesting minority report that was submitted by like about five people which was just damming with respect to their observations about how nasa works the safety issues
take it as the opinion of these five people who were on the return to flight committee
it makes good reading
but that is all in the aerolibrary
our midterm recommendations
in some sense we made these recommendations assuming the shuttle program would continue
and i think we had this recommendation for an independent safety organization
and what i thought was one of our most important recommendations was that if you intend to fly the shuttle past two thousand ten you should recertify it
now certification is a very technical process where you have to go through every piece of equipment and in some sense revalidate that it will satisfy the requirements one hundred one point five what better project for the shuttle program office and the independent safety organization than to recertify the shuttle
at least that was my vision
that would really be an extremely useful thing to do to work together to recertify the shuttle
now unfortunately evidently the shuttle is not going to operate past two thousand ten so we will see
i mean they won't recertify it
now i think what's going to happen is they're going to get up to two thousand nine and are going to say oh my gosh we don't have any way to get to space
there is going to be enormous pressure to keep the shuttle operating past two thousand ten
and of course they will be late to need in terms of recertifying
it is going to be a bit of a jump all at that point
it should be very interesting to watch
now the long term recommendation of course we made was that we need an agreed upon vision for further manned space flight
and so from my point of view we skip the midterm and we went immediately to the long term because with the president's new program that we have basically set this vision
and unfortunately we have skipped some of the intermediate steps that would have strengthened nasa as an organization and its ability to carry out a new mission
i stand back watching as all of this develops having had this incredible background of being a member of this accident investigation board
it looks like i landed the plane right on time
yes
incidentally i brought this halloween candy
and i would really appreciate it if you guys would come and take it because it's not something that my husband and i need
and if it doesn't get eaten would somebody please take it down and put it with the graduate students downstairs
good
anyway you had a question
i am wondering if you think there might have been any effect on that if it was explicitly stated that this is why we want the recertification to happen
i don't know
you know it is hard to micromanage a big organization
i personally was disappointed because i believed very strongly in this
and i felt that it would be a way to bring the organization together around this set of ideas
so that won't happen
and we will see how they work with this independent safety board that they have put in place
all of what we're doing is self education
it is organizational education
it is self education
it is process education
so we will see how they will bring all that together
the reason i asked that was because actually in terms of reading this recommendation i read it a little differently
i thought it was kind of a push to move past the shuttle to say that recertification is going to be too complicated
well there might have been a little bit of that
i mean it really was up to nasa to decide whether a process that was so resource intensive was worth doing i mean given the fact that the shuttle is in the sort of sunset of its career
i guess i felt that we should leave that to them but that they could not continue to operate the way they were operating
i think that was really the message
they had to make a decision
sheila the board's recommendation of the number of two thousand ten has had enormous impact
i know
of course it has
very negative from my point of view
say something about how you picked that number and how flexible it is
well recall we did this in two thousand four
we wanted to give nasa enough time to get back to flying
and of course the whole definition of what recertification means is a bit unclear
in other words i would think that nasa could have gone in
i think what we saw was we needed to get a couple of flights under our belt but we needed to go back
i think what we meant by recertification is a relook at the whole mission
what is that thing called
mission rules
no not mission rules
when they get together and decide whether they are going to fly
mission readiness review
flight readiness review
we felt that the flight readiness review was broken and that part of the reason it was broken is that there were too many requirements that were silly like the shuttle had only two wings instead of four because you'd need redundancy
wings are important and if you really thought they were important you would have four instead of two
and every time they did a flight readiness review you would have to go through these what i would call silly requirements
one issue about recertification was to try to narrow down to what were the key systems that needed reexamination in the light of technology and what we know about the shuttle
that in and of itself would have been a very useful process that would have helped this
and so i think what we saw is that there is a set of processes that need to be carried out after a couple of successful flights that would really position the organization to do its job one hundred seven point zero they wasted a lot of time
but suppose someone had come back to you or members of the board and said well life would be easier for us if we called it two thousand thirteen
well i would think if you're going to do that that nasa should come forward with a plan at the minimum of how they're going to operate the shuttle safely through two thousand thirteen
they have not even thought about doing that
they are carrying on with business as usual
flight flight flight
and they are not thinking about this more fundamental issue which would i think be very useful for them as an organization of what are the critical issues if we wanted to operate the shuttle to two thousand thirteen
they just kind of got off the hook by saying two thousand ten we can do that
you know pretty shallow
yes
and this is going to have to be the last question unfortunately
anyway you're all invited to my office to see my big poster on the flight
your recommendation for not flying unless you have a safe house in orbit
no we didn't recommend that
oh safe house in orbit
ok
if you would have said that at the beginning of the shuttle program that would have cut out dozens of flights
sure
but you see at the beginning of the program nasa was committed to a system that met its requirements
once they backed off of a system that met it requirements they left itself open to operating a risky system
and so then you come in after having two accidents and say ok how can we operate this system safety
you've already demonstrated that you're willing to back off on requirements so how can we identify what some key issues are so that you get back to operating safely
what we fundamentally recommended was that you should develop onboard repair capability
and that's really all we said
and we sort of left open how they would do that
and so they investigated a lot of things and decided that it would be a heck of a lot easier if they could use the space station for a repair
and so they themselves said ok space station only
that really was not our recommendation
although we understood that it would be a lot easier to do space station repair
ok
thank you very much
good morning
i am filling in for professor hoffman who is off addressing the french parliament at this moment or maybe it was yesterday afternoon
tough choices of whether to stay here or go there
well that's right noah
these days the issue of knowing where you are navigation is really taken for granted
we have gps in our cell phones
gps in handheld devices
gps tells the taxi driver whether or not he should be turning up that one way street
when we began with human space travel particularly as we entered the apollo era the question of navigation along with guidance and control was still a major issue
in fact it was rather uncertain whether or not in the apollo mission we were going to be able to with assurance do all of the navigation required for going to lunar trajectory and then doing the precise navigation to land on the moon
the history of leading guidance navigation and control has now for a period of over half a century been located just adjacent to at one time part of mit the instrumentation laboratory now draper laboratory
and the tradition carried on through apollo to the space shuttle program
and then as i think as you are aware beyond that into nasa's current plans
we're privileged today to have discuss with us the guidance navigation and control issues on the shuttle doctor phil hattis
doctor hattis a graduate of northwestern and caltech with his phd from the aero astro department at mit has been at draper since one thousand nine hundred seventy four
he is a member of the laboratory technical staff which is the highest technical position available there
he serves as the technical lead for the crew exploration vehicle development program in gn and c at draper laboratory
phil has been very active in aiaa
he is a fellow
he has been head of the new england region
has received the draper lab distinguished performance awards and various nasa recognition awards for his contributions to sts one and sts eight missions
then we will hear about draper's contributions and the overall issue of gn and c
thanks a lot larry
i should just point out when i came up here as a graduate student to pursue my doctorate
i was a draper fellow
i started working on the shuttle as a draper fellow so much of the work i will be talking about here i was probably only a year or two older than any of you when i was doing this
and that's turned out to be fairly useful to nasa because with the shuttle still flying from time to time issues come up and they stick pick my brain about what we did in one thousand nine hundred seventy four seventy five and seventy six which wouldn't had been so easy if i had been at my current age then
but it is also a little bit alarming because it means the people that are working on the system now don't really understand why it was designed the way it is
now the other thing they could have asked me for was the report on which this material was based which i wrote in one thousand nine hundred eighty three to educate the rest of the people at draper who were going to work on the program subsequently about this system
now the other thing i just want to say is feel free to interrupt me at any point to ask questions
i am going to be covering a lot of ground and i may not get back to the area that you're interested in asking me about if you wait
so just raise your hand or speak up or whatever you feel like
and the other things i want to point out are two things
one what you're going to be looking is largely what was done for the first shuttle flight except where i mention specific upgrades
now i am not going to be comprehensively covering all the upgrades that have been done to the shuttle since
what you will also note is this presentation will be largely monochrome
and why
because it is drawn from a presentation of one thousand nine hundred eighty three when there was no such thing as a laptop or powerpoint and color was a real pain to get
you had to go to the artist and then get it lithographically reproduced which was an incredibly cost
what color you see i've added now and it's limited except for a couple of pictures at the end
i do have some before and after cockpit pictures at the end
you will periodically see a chart like this topics of discussion we'll go from section to section and we're going to delineate the areas i'm going to cover
there are going to be a whole bunch of sub bullets for each of these areas as i go through
this will be not real deep unless you ask me the questions and i will go as deep as you want with the questions but covering a lot of ground
some of these pictures you may have seen in one form or another but i should just highlight certain points
the systems related to the flight control were placed all over the shuttle
in the forward area which was the only pressurized portion of the shuttle below the livable areas was the avionics bay
and in there where the computers the inertial measurement unit and i want to say something about that in a moment what they refer to as multiplexers demultiplexers
you've got a lot of analog systems or you had to convert back and forth between digital and analog
and the electronic boxes that drove the commands for the reaction control system thrusters
and then you have hand controllers and displays and indicators in the cockpit
in the back you have pods which have many of the reaction control system jets the orbital maneuvering system thrusters
and i will be talking quite a bit more about them later
and there was also in the aft avionics bay that had specific subsystems for which it was deemed unacceptable to have them forward
some of them were local analog digital conversion boxes but also rate gyros which were used during assent and entry where they wanted them closer to the center of mass by being in the back and in the front avoiding some of the flexure issues associated with the long distance to the front
this particular configuration you're looking at is before the external tank separated after the solid rocket boosters had come off
this configuration is where the story begins because what i am going to be talking about is the part that draper did which is the exoatmospheric flight control system
and that begins at main engine shutdown and ends when you hit four hundred thousand feet on the way back
there are different phases that we will be talking about
the first is what we refer to as insertion which is from the time the main engines cut off to the time you do initial orbit circularization
and that includes a brief but design challenge phase while you're attached to the external tank
it includes the separation maneuver from that
and in the original flight profile for the shuttle two burns of the orbital maneuvering system the original orbit insertion strategy for the shuttle put it in an orbit that typically had an apogee of about sixty nautical miles a perigee of just a few nautical miles
what you would do is the first burn would raise that perigee up to the one hundred plus nautical mile target altitude and then the second burn halfway around the earth would put you into a circular orbit and then you would begin your mission there
later in the program for overall efficiency in order to improve the payload margins that strategy changed
and they tended to do more what they call direct insertion which had a substantial higher apogee
the perigee wasn't much higher but you would end up somewhere between those two
and then you would do one oms burn and you would get a net gain of maybe one or two thousand pounds which became very important
during this insertion phase all the applicable sensors were on
now i said i was going to say something about the imu
and most of you don't even think probably these days about having rate gyro separate from an inertial measurement unit
you get these combined packages called inertial navigation systems now
they're actually navigators that have the software
they do all the processing for you
they even have built in gps receivers
of course we didn't have gps then
the inertial measurement unit was a pretty clunky gimbaled device at the time the shuttle first flew
it subsequently got upgraded to ring laser gyro systems
but that inertial measurement unit was simply outputting angles that were significant throughput issues
because you had to do a lot of data crunching to get rates from that
computers are really slow
i will talk a little bit more about that in a few minutes
having rate gyros separate was a way to get data that these days would be all built into one box
general purpose computers all of them were on during ascent
i will talk about the partisan of them but there were actually five of them
and the vernier reaction control system which is a small group of jets and i will point those out later were not active
the larger thrusters were
and then after the second oms burn you transition to another flight phase
and why all these flight phases i will get to in a couple minutes also
then orbit phase began after the second burn
you quickly open the doors so that you could dump waste heat
the radiators are on the inside of the doors
and when the doors are closed the heat just radiates back into the vehicle
all payload operations are during this phase
and you did a lot of power down to save
you're working off of fuel cells
it limits your mission life both because of the limits on the weight of the reactants and on the places you can put any extra tanks
so you turn off the rate gyros you don't need those anymore and i will explain why
two of the five general purpose computers were shut down
this also being a late seventy s computer design you're talking maybe on the order of a couple hundred watts per computer which by the way i will explain more about but was a one hundred four thousand word memory capacity
that was actually an improvement from the approach and landing test when it was sixty four thousand words
and then you turned off two of the three redundant inertial measurement units except for critical phases
also the safe power the feeling was that if you lost your navigation reference you would have a relatively benign environment to bring one of the others up
and the vernier thrusters were made available because they were used for flying control
then you have the deorbit phase
you close the doors again
you do the deorbit burn
you dump any residual propellant from the forward tanks by simultaneously burning opposing thrusters in order to get an acceptable center of mass for entry
getting the acceptable location of the center of mass for attitude and thermal control during entry is very critical
you reactive all the sensors
you go back to all the computers being up
then you turn the vernier jets back off and you fly the vehicle using this mode until you're at four hundred thousand feet which is about where you pick up zero point five gs
and that is where the entry phase takes over
and this is just a summary of the profile
now this is where i wanted to take the opportunity to talk a little bit about computers and profiles and everything else
when we started this program with a sixty four thousand word computer i talk in terms of words instead of bytes
the architecture of this computer didn't have bytes
you had words and half words
each word was equivalent to about four bytes in terms of number of characters you could insert into it
but you only could break it down into pieces of two
so we had two hundred eight thousand well a thousand times twenty four pieces of memory that we could work with on this computer
for the approach and landing test which was very limited you flew it off of a seven hundred forty seven for a couple of minutes sixty four thousand words worked just fine
and they were chugging along with the program saying we're going to get all this orbital mission stuff into that computer
and of course we discovered probably a year after we really began the job we began the job seriously in seventy five and by seventy six it was obvious sixty four thousand words wasn't going to work
they upped it to one hundred four thousand words
it was probably obvious four months later that one hundred four thousand words wasn't going to work
so the solution in addition to descoping as much as possible what you had to have was to separate the computer loads that you had for up and down which you did when you were doing your orbital mission
and then you had something called the mass memory device which is basically a tape drive which when you went from this phase to this phase would reload some of the computers
and then you went from this phase to this phase we'd reload them again
and i said there were five of these computers
four of them of what i'll be talking about were the primary computer set
quad redundant so that they would vote all data going in and out to decide whether or not there was an inconsistency between one computer and the other
and it would automatically deselect the bad computer the implications of which i will talk about probably about three quarters of the way through the presentation
when you went up and down all four computers were operating the same software
the fifth computer was called the backup flight control system
and the reason it was there these four primary computers a chunk of that one hundred four thousand words
probably thirty thousand to forty thousand words was used to assure the computer set operated successfully redundantly
there was always a concern that there would be a generic software error that would show up at some bizarre time and that you could pull down the whole computer set
it was an independently coded similar architecture from the standpoint of algorithm content
but independently coded software called the backup flight control system that on the hand controller there was a button the crew could hit a panic button if they needed to
and the system would revert from the primary system backup system
it never happened in the history of the program it has never been used but it is still there
and so those five computers are all operating on the way up and on the way down
now when you go to the onboard phase and only three computers are up you freeze dry as they say to the computers
one computer remains the backup flight computer turned off ready to turn on from emergency entry to backup
the other one is a primary software load ready to start
the remaining three computers two of them were redundant set for the on orbit functions
and one of them again because of memory problems everything payload related was in a system management and monitoring other non flight control related functions with one of the other computers
they did this spread of functions across computers in addition to adding the tape drive in order to accommodate the memory constraints because the shuttle mission was so much more complex than what the computers were originally designed to accommodate
so you say it never happened
have there been instances in which any of the backup computers have been brought online
there have been instances in which primary computers have failed
there has never been an instance in which they've reverted to the backup system
now when the primary systems fail and i will elaborate this in more detail while each computer computes the functionality for everything they only control more or less a quarter of the subsystems
and there is a distribution
and some of the charts towards the end will talk about how this was done
and there are implications associated with what you lose when the computer goes down
but if you have time in your noncritical flight phase you can restring those things to the remaining healthy computers and recover accessible systems even though that computer has gone down
now on sts nine that was incidentally our mit department's first shuttle flight
and it had byron lichtenberg one of our people
and what turned out happened to be floating solder balls and an early version of these computers that caused intermittent shorts
and one computer went down before entry
they recovered the string
another computer went down during entry
and because they had reconfigured the string they had three of the four strings left but only two computers
and another one failed on touchdown
and had that one failed before touchdown they probably would have reverted to the backup system
that's the closest they ever came to a backup system
now the question that comes to my mind there since the generic failure was not software but floating solder balls which all the computers were susceptible to what would have happened if they had gone to the backup system
because it could have gone down too and then they would have had nothing
because once they've gone to the backup it is not easy to revert in critical flight phase to the primary system
lichtenberg as i mentioned was a crew member from our lab
later i asked him how did he feel when the first computer went down and then the second computer went down
byron has an aero astro phd and pretty savvy
he said he was pretty worried until he looked at the commander who was john young and john said well we might as well go to sleep because we're not going to reenter today
and when john went to sleep he said he might as well go to sleep too and it will be all right
and it was
yes
the computer was the same
the software was not
the computers themselves are all interchangeable ap one hundred one computers
subsequently they were changed to ap one hundred one s computers which is modified version that was used on the b one bomber
and they went to two hundred fifty six thousand words of memory
and that is the current state of the art
you have to understand several things
one it is very expensive to upgrade systems that are already flying
but independent of that you never fly in space something that is close to the state of the art because you have to go through all the qualifications which takes a lot of time and it has to be radiation hardened when you're in space
and when it's a human vehicle it has also got to go through human qualification
the space station architecture is ibm three hundred eighty six processor quality so it is basically like maybe about one thousand nine hundred eighty six eighty seven early laptop generation computers
oh yes
there were quite a few missions
i don't think there have ever been any missions where they lost two
the imu failures don't seem to have been anything systemic but just sort of a random problem
and i'm not sure since they have gone to the ring laser gyro systems that they have had any failures
i think it was the mechanical ones from the early days that they had some problems
now major requirements for the systems
we had two different autopilots for three phase transmission which incorporated both the insertion and the orbit features and on orbit so we only had two different software loads on that tape drive for the primary flight control system
the rules for shuttle were that after any subsystem failure you have the capability to remain operational
no critical functions were lost
after two failures safe operation all critical things necessary to terminate the mission and bring them home would be possible
but some of the mission objectives may not be achievable
the system was mainly aimed at controlling rigid body characteristics and velocity changes within specification
only when we started to look at docking with the mirror in the space station did we start worrying about flexible body effects
and it was because of what they were attaching to and not because of the shuttle all those appendages and those things
if shuttle does control space station and did control mir when it was docked
and so there have been some modes which i won't really be talking about today but were created to facilitate that control without causing unacceptable loads on those flexible appendages of the stations
and eighty millisecond app cycle two reasons that happened
we originally planned to do forty milliseconds
the approach and landing test program was
first there is less process of burden if you do it half as often
and the other when it came to the reaction control system as we discovered in about early one thousand nine hundred eighty a little more than a year before the first flight that there was a water hammer effect in the propellant lines on the rcs jets were the opening of the valves caused an expansion wave which reflected as a compression wave
the closing of the valves caused a compression wave
the inner section compression waves if the valves were opened and closed too quickly could cause a catastrophically large compression wave that could burst the line
so they deemed it better rather than redesign the entire feed system to limit us to never firing faster than eighty millisecond cycles
now that differed from apollo
apollo had one hundred millisecond cycle time but they had the ability to interrupt the cycle to turn out enough jets if they wanted a short firing
we couldn't do that because of the water hammer effect
and also because the propellant feed system involved a liquid in the tank with zero g acquisition devices around the surface of the tank directly exposed to the pressured helium which means some of the helium dissolved into the fluid
if the fluid was drawn too fast the helium could bubble out causing a gap in those zero g acquisition devices around the tank preventing flow
if you get unbalanced flow of hypergolic propulsion systems you can also get an explosion
so the solution to that was limiting how many jets you could fire at one time off of one tank
does everybody understand what the zero g acquisition problem is
it's a surface tension base
you have various types of rings and shapes on there that captured fluid by surface tension to there which would begin to draw the fluid
and once you began to get some flow because of firing things it would pull the blobs of fluid into the tanks and into the feed lines from the tanks
as you recall the origin of the problem is that the fluid would not be at the bottom of the tank so you risk drawing a bubble
the surface tension holds enough there to start the firing
when you fire you get some force
the force draws the blob to the same parts of the tanks where you can acquire the fluid
and as long as you don't draw too fast the communication between that part of the tank and the fluid remains
this was a very complicated qualification program
a lot of c one hundred thirty five parabolic trajectory time got used to test out various perturbating of the inside of the tanks
and i am not going to talk about that in detail but i'm sure there are a lot of papers out in the literature about how they qualified these things
and i don't think there were too many systems before the shuttle that actually did it this way
one used systems that tended to use membranes where you had the pressure on one side and the fluid on the other side and the membrane would just force the fluid to stay in contact
but the problem is the membranes would degrade over time on exposure to these hypergolic propellants
hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide are very chemical reactive materials
for instance it was supposed to be used over many years up to a hundred times
the idea that you would have periodically keep opening up these tanks to change a membrane was not attractive when you consider the tanks are deep inside of the structure
so this may have been a unique issue because of a reusable system but it also may be relevant to systems that even if they aren't reusable have to have a very long life in space
modes and submodes i will quickly go through but you have rotation and translation modes
these modes could be used simultaneously for the rcs system and then separately for the oms system
and you had special modes which to get extra oomph out of the rcs jets if you had an abort that would sometimes be done if the oms engineers weren't available
the oms engines there were two of them which were up on the back right and left pods from that picture i showed a few minutes ago
and you could use one or two depending on what you were doing
and in the rcs rotation modes you had various ways you could use it
proportional meant you moved the stick
the response you get is in proportion to what you do how long the jets fire
discrete means you move the stick and you get a specific amount of rate change
pulse means you just get a single little pulse out
and acceleration means as long as you're holding the stick out it keeps firing them
and those are all
there were push button displays that the crew could adjust
there were some modes for each of those which affected how many jets fired whether or not you wanted to force it to use something that approximated couples or you were in propellant conservation mode and you were willing to get accept getting a rotation rate
with coupled in the translation you would care about that effect
and in the translation there were various submodes as well
and in particular you would use more jets when you were separating from the external tank to get away as fast as possible
yes
on the previous slide are there different modes for the rcs jets
was there one that they happened to use the most or was like supposed to be the primary usage or are they all part of the normal operating
i think they would rarely use this or this
i think these two were commonly used
this is very fuel inefficient
it would only be used as kind of an emergency measure
that's also very difficult from the point of view of the pilot to have direct acceleration control
right
i mean this might be something you would call upon if actually for some reason the vehicle started to spin up unexpectedly and you would have to neutralize that
does that adequately answer your question for now
there will be an opportunity to collect a little more detail on that later
but again you wanted to get off the tank quickly so you would use all the jets you had to get off of it
you wouldn't do that later
you would have more jets that you would use for roll control while you're on the tank because you had a much higher roll inertia
you want to only spend a few seconds on the tank after the main engines shut down
you could often be left with residual rates you've got to quickly kill
there was an inhibit on the separation if you had more than half a degree per second on each of the axes
there was actually a phenomenon on the first shuttle flight which almost got us in trouble
one of the first things that happens after the main engines shut down is you slew the engines back to stow position where you want the engines for entry
the reason is the auxiliary power units are needed to move the main engines
you want to shut those down and save the hydrazine for those until you get back to it just before entry
on the first shuttle flight they kicked those engines at about one hertz
it turned out the first fundamental mode the rock mode of the orbiter on the external tank had a subharmonic of about almost exactly one fourth of that slew rate on the main engines
the slewing of the engines then causes the rocky mode to be excited
we were seeing oscillations very close to the inhibit for the separation
the crew was getting a little worried but we just got it in bounds in the automatic mode
and if they hadn't separated in time it would have gotten pretty complicated to do it manually
we made quite a few changes after that
there were a lot of things we learned on the first flight and i will point a few of them out as we go along
there was also a launch pad phenomenology
it is not part of my talk
has this come up in the class about the shockwave from the srb ignition
yes
ok
they didn't have those waterbeds in there on the first flight
what was relevant here one of the things that you may or may not know is that the struts that held the forward rcs tanks on the first flight were buckled almost to failure
that wasn't realized until they got home but had they failed they probably would have burst and blown up the vehicle
the on orbit modes we have both primary and vernier jets which were only used separately except under special circumstances which were designed substantially after the first flight
we have local vertical and inertial frame of reference control capability with respect to the discrete rate mode
and otherwise it is pretty similar to what you saw in the previous picture
and submodes some features were added because of rendezvous
you could fire a lot of jets on the fort side
if you wanted to do a rapid breaking you could inhibit all the jets to fire in that direction
if you wanted to limit the use of plumes it turns out that you didn't lose completely your translation control authority
because the jets in the front and back that were in the x axis coupled about twenty percents of the trust into the z axis
so if you fired them simultaneously in both directions you could avoid pluming an object in front of you and still get enough translation to control that axis
and just to show how everything was hooked up the inertial measurement units and rate gyros and hand controllers and panel controls all went in through these multiplexer devices feeding the signals then into the computer and displays
and then you had outputs going through these similar types of electronic boxes specific to the reaction control jets that generated the commands that were needed by the solenoid valves that actually opened and closed the hypergolic feed lines
looking at the whole top level architecture then of the gn and c system is all those boxes feeding into what was inside of the computer
inside of the computer you have subsystem operation software managing each of the subsystems doing the redundancy management
the specific guidance navigation control algorithms
there was a moding and sequencing function which was based on both manual and automatic scripts
then the actual driving of the displays of controls is interactive with the flight control system both ways providing feedback to the crew members and accepting their inputs
and then what was left was the system management function on this computer that didn't go into the separate computer
by the way anything related to robotic arm operations were operated through that separate computer
one of the issues that came along later in the program is the flight control computer never knew what was happening with the arm
if you take a space telescope sized payload and put it forty feet out there it drastically changes the mass properties
and one of the features you will see a little later that we stuck in was the ability for the crew by pushbutton to select different tables about expected accelerations of the jets because we didn't know when we needed to respond to that
there were also flexure issues with the arm which came up as they went along too and established constraints on how we operated
but was there any thought given to having an adaptive system which would identify the current parameters
that would have gone way beyond the capacity of the computers that we had
it would be relatively easy to do with the programs we had but it would never fit in a one hundred four k memory computer
but there has been lots of work that some of my graduate students have done over the years of how we should have done that
brent appleby who is now a division leader at the lab actually did some work back in the eighty s i think that may have been his master's thesis on some of those issues
but in reality we're approaching very large memories which would allow you to do it
well when we go into cev we're probably going to assume that one hundred megabytes is no big deal
unfortunately was cancelled but we were doing exactly that
we knew exactly the position all the movement when we were grappling
and we were changing all the tables based on the current angles
it is a real challenge to maintain stability on a system where you have no insight into that
but you would never build a spacecraft that way today so i'm not sure
the challenges we have are very interesting but probably no longer relevant
the challenges that remain are the flexural dynamic interaction problems
i just wanted to indicate that within the control laws you have a steering processor
which i will talk a little bit about more an rcs jet processor a state estimator and an oms processor
the state estimator is unique to the on orbit flight
and there is more that represents that in a minute
so i am going to now having entered the overview go into each of the subsystems in more detail by pulling up this picture to talk about it a little more these subsystems in the context
the forward rcs system had fourteen primary eight hundred seventy pound jets and two vernier twenty four pound jets
there were twenty four and four respectively
those systems in back evenly divided left and right
each of the pods in the back had one oms engine
the forward rcs system had its own self contained hypergolic tanks
the aft system had rcs tanks and oms tanks which could be interconnected from within the pod or could be cross fed across the pods
now the consequence to the flight control system there were different constraints and simultaneous jet firings
and how you counted whether it was only left or right or both depending on which mode you were in if you had a mission and needed a lot of rcs propellant and you had spare space in the oms tanks it allowed benefiting from that
why are there so many thrusters pointing in the same direction
for redundancy
yes redundancy and maximum control authority
you want to find control authority normally with redundancy but for external tank separation you wanted high acceleration in one direction
for high rendezvous breaking you wanted high acceleration in the other direction plus or minus z
and for backup to the oms engine you wanted to have higher acceleration in the plus x direction
and then when you were doing entry which i'm not talking about today you had an on demand rcs control authority in the upper atmosphere during hypersonic flight
and you would turn on one two three or four yaw thrusters in particular as needed
i think one two and occasionally three thrusters had been turned on during disturbances
one of the things we've learned from the telemetry of the columbia accident is as this vehicle was falling apart for probably twenty or thirty seconds the vehicle was controlling very nicely because they kept turning on more and more jets
they were getting major torque imbalances from missing pieces of the vehicle
but it was still controlling the attitude until the damage got so severe that was no longer possible
again i already talked about the number of the thrusters
the primary thrusters for the reasons we talked about there were many jets
and also because translation and rotation control was accommodated by these verniers a feature i will mention briefly later
it was only a rotation control system and fundamentally does not have redundancy
i already talked about the on time
these are just typical propellant loads and thrust levels and specific impulse numbers
you notice that large maneuvers are always a little more efficiently done with the primary jets and even more efficiently still with the oms as you will see in another chart
life for duty cycles and on time are relevant for a vehicle that is going to fly a lot of missions
flying control almost always will be done with vernier jets not just because of propellant
which it is much more efficient but also because you will get a lot more mission life out of it
this is a stick drawing of those
there is a numbering system associated with it
frl for which pot it's in
up down forward right left
the last character for which direction it fires
and then the middle number is a manifold
if you see a five that is the vernier jets
one two three or four any pod that has got the same middle number is on one manifold
if a failure shut that manifold or a string took down that manifold all of those jets were lost
when you lose a string you would have one manifold per pod that you would lose
that means under some circumstance because the vernier system is redundant a single failure could take that out
but that wasn't critical to carrying out most mission objectives or to safety
that is probably enough said on that
the oms typical propellant loads mentioned here
on time never less than two seconds
never less than with one engine twelve thousand pound second impulse with a six thousand pound thrust not suitable for fine maneuvers
the rcs jets would always be used to trim out any large oms burn errors
had a significantly higher specific impulse
for large maneuvers you're clearly better off from a propellant weight perspective using that system
each of the engines had redundant gimbal control redundant by having one mechanical screw system but you could drive the nut or you could drive the screw
and there were different electrical systems that did that
this was the maximum authority
and the two axes at each engine could move a portion of which was used to tract the center of mass as the vehicle consumed propellant or delivered payloads and a portion of which was for actual thrust vector control management
we also had to subtract a little bit
you never want to go too close to the hard stops because you risk mechanical failure by doing that
and you always have a little bit of mechanical uncertainty of exactly where you are anyway
a portion of that was a mechanical uncertainty and a portion of that was just a mechanical safety margin
this is a drawing in the two different planes of the rotation of the engines showing the span between the center say about fifteen feet apart no surprise given the general cross section of the shuttle
an important thing to notice is that the engine while i can point through the cg is not pointing anywhere near the body access of the vehicle
and by the way the vehicle body axes weren't there was a significant offset between the principle axis of the vehicle and the body axis component of inertia and the body axis was quite large
three units even with the replacements they have gone through over the years there remains three units for the inss now but the imu where mechanical systems with quanta for knowledge of state which were not all that small
and the rgas were even worse the rate gyros
these quanta were quite significant
the reason was we had a half word in that multiplexity multiplexer for translating the analog signal to a digital signal which determined based on the maximum range the maximum range being dictated by maneuver rates where possible during ascent and entry and not on orbit
but we were stuck with that
it was hardwired into the cards
and so these quanta then we discovered there was a one sigma probability of an every third cycle one quanta noise spike on the data that came across the mdms
and that was pretty significant when we were trying to do fine control during the transition phase
were the noise levels determined by this quantization in effect the
the noise phenomenology was related to the electronics of the card but it was directly related to the least significant byte
but the mechanical sensors themselves were superior to that
yes they were
it was the mdm card that introduced the noise
if you had used one word from the mdms that would have
given the state of the art to have processed that much information across the mdms would have made it too slow
we're talking orders of magnitude slower electronics from the late seventy s than you have today so the half word was dictated by the data rates that we required of these boxes
now i'm going to go into specific features on the software side
yeah
with the gyros it seems on hubble and station for example we always hear bad news on the gyros having to be replaced every so often
well first of all what i'm talking about here at the time the shuttle first flew are mechanical gyros
hubble may have started mechanical gyros
they have been changed out at least once or twice
and are probably fiber optic systems
hubble has the problem that it's in a fairly high orbit three hundred plus nautical miles high for the shuttle anyway
it has a significant radiation exposure particularly when it goes through the south atlantic anomaly of the radiation belts which are three hundred nautical miles
much more time they spend on that than at one hundred nautical miles
cumulative radiation damage to the electronics in those gyros is probably a contributing factor to the failure rates that they're seeing on hubble
i would say they must spend a few percentage of their time in the south atlantic anomaly at that altitude
are the gyro replacements we're talking about measurement gyros or attitude control gyros
well the fine guidance gyros are the ones that have been the big problem on the hubble
we're talking about quantitatively a different regime we're operating here
the quantization take away the noise effects was something we could live with for operating the flight control system
in hubble you want to be able to measure rates two or three orders of magnitude lower than what we're talking about here
the actual design of the sensors is substantially different because they're trying to get very very tiny little rates out
these are trying to maintain the image lock when you're using the full magnification capability of the telescope and whatever target that it has
nevertheless i would imagine that if the shuttle gyros are staying at three hundred nautical miles for five to ten years they would fail too
radiation is one of the fundamental drivers for all missions
and it often that atlantic anomaly is one of the big drivers for low inclination
space telescopes are twenty eight point five degree inclinations
so they don't have to deal with the magnetic fields coming in toward the poles which a polar mission has to but there is this big dip in the van allen belts off the coast of south america which poses a problem for everything that isn't low orbit
the functionality we have in the autopilot we use the rate gyros and the inertial measurement unit on the transitioned app to get states direction giving us altitude giving us rate
on orbit we have the gyro shutdown to conserve power view data only
that then dictates that we are going to have a state estimator on orbit
we have to put some special features to overcome the rate gyro noise in the transition phase which is irrelevant when the rate gyros aren't operating in the on orbit phase
we have the vernier jets and the associated algorithm logic for on orbit which isn't in the transition phase
we worry a lot more about every detail propellant deficiency on orbit because we spend so much more time there
we have a lot of features we've added to minimize propellant there
the oms capability in the two phases is actually identical with both of them having a capability to wrap around the rcs jets to the thrust vector control should the thrust vector control not behave properly during that oms burn
and this just delineates the various features we have for steering
oms and rcs
where we add lots more features because there are a lot more things you are attempting to track when you're doing your mission on orbit than when you're just trying to get to and from orbit
notice the rates that we're talking about
typically you look at an ins box these days and you see hundreds of hertz data rates
what restricted us here was how fast could we for instance none of the software was in the sensor package
it was in our computer
and we had a severe throughput problem
and the solution since we had the rate gyros for rates and we only needed the imus for attitudes and rates could be used to extrapolate attitudes for a reasonable period of time was to greatly reduce the processing rate of the imu down to on the order of one hertz submultiple of twenty five hertz which is why it is one point four
on orbit since it was our only source of information we had to eat a larger processing burden operating on a six point twenty five hertz but we still were extrapolating in between the state estimate of one time constant
we'll talk a little bit about what we're doing with that but everything down here is operating at twelve point five and we're getting the data in at six point twenty five
there are a lot of things you would do differently simply because you don't have these low rate constraints due to throughput limits
the architecture then for the autopilot that is being representative on orbit is you would have a maneuver module where all the features for steering the vehicle would be kind of an adjunct to guidance
you would have these modes controlled by the crew and the push button display of what the stick deflections would do
you would have the phase plane which would be tracking attitude error rate error and whether or not you should fire jets as a function of those errors separate per axis
are there people here that don't know about phase planes
ok
well the concept of the phase plane you go to optimal control theory and you look into a situation where you have a control effector which is on or off by directional which is what thrusters are
and you look at what it takes given an error in a plane which is attitude error and rate error and you want to get minimum time to neutralize that error to zero fifty one point thirty five but you have lots of dead zones which i will talk about more to assure that you don't inefficiently use the jets so that you are not constantly trying to fire the jets to get exactly to the origin which is never possible
the state estimator which is a form of a kalman filter
and then the jet selection logic which is essentially for the primary jet lookup tables
but it turned out to probably be the first use of real based intelligence
we didn't think about these things in that time
and when i talk about the stringing later i think we were also using an early version of failure tree analysis
but in the one thousand nine hundred seventy s none of these things were named
and then you have various loads for the parameters that determine these dead zones and tables and all that
and the crew would select these from push button displays
for the oms you could either have hand controller inputs or cross product steering and based guidance inputs which would then go into roll and pitch and yaw
thrust vector processing channels were roll and pitch coupled
roll is only possible of course when you're firing two engines by differentially pitching the gimbals on the two engines
this would actually be an rcs loop automatically with one engine but you had to have the two pads coupled when you were trying to do both of them
but the yaw axis was separate
just keeping in mind the time
go through one or two more charts before the break
that's fine
i will go through the state estimator and then we can take a short break
the state estimator again we were only getting attitude information at six point twenty five hertz from the primary thrusters trying to maintain an estimate of the vehicle rotation rates
we also wanted to know what disturbances on orbit you can have out gassing the vehicle
you have gravity gradients
you have aero torques which have a diurnal variation depending on where you are on earth orbit relative to where the sun is which are tending to torque the vehicle in a particular direction
having knowledge of how that torque is behaving in a certain time enables you to manipulate your phase plane switching lines to more efficiently use the jets
we were trying to estimate that
given that we only had imu data with noise and quantization effects we also had flexure we weren't accounting for in doing that
so we had a low rate filter which incorporated the measurements directly and a higher rate filter which was also taking in feed forward information we're going to fire the jets
we expect these velocity changes rotational and translational to occur as a result of the jet firing
and you can build that into the estimate to anticipate that effect
and then given all that information basically use that in the form of a common filter
we had different gains associated with primary and vernier jet usage because given the factor of thirty difference in the rotational acceleration authority of these jets they were fundamentally different bandwidth systems on the basis of the actuators
we accommodated those different bandwidths in the software
that by the way affected us when we started worrying about flexure on the arm because we found that some of the modes with heavy payloads in the arm actually fell within this bandwidth
and in the case of the vernier jets were falling right near the roll off point which was the worst possible place to have a flexure mode
and there were some significant design issues that were addressed later in the program as a result of that
and then this disturbance acceleration question
at the time that you were designing these was there sufficient knowledge of the structural modes or the bending modes
for the rms payload operations not at all
we first learned about that when we started looking at use of the arm to deploy the spas one payload in sts seven
nobody understood at the time we were designing for the first shuttle flight the kind of coupling effects you would get from payloads on the arm
it hadn't been modeled yet
i would say probably about the time the first flights were occurring is when we started to look at that stuff but the shuttle software for the first flight was ninety five percents frozen by seventy eight even though the flight didn't occur until eighty one
you then discovered them in simulations or from flight data
no it was from high fidelity simulations with the arm dynamics included in that
we understood it pretty well
we refined it after the flights
we did even do some flight tests on sts eight with an object called a payload flight test article
the original payload on that flight couldn't fly in time so they put this eight thousand pound dumbbell on there and the arm was able to manipulate
went through all kinds of exercises and pretty much validated it with the simulations
were towing us at that point in time
but it was a real lot of work that went into those high fidelity robotic arm simulations and coupling that to the flight control system to get those numbers
and a lot of work into evaluating what it all meant in terms of restrictions on the use of the control system
and then the last thing i will talk about before the break the disturbance acceleration estimator had a fifty six second time constant
mostly the disturbances we are talking about were either orbital or semi orbit half orbit type of periodicity
you wanted to allow adequate time to integrate and determine their effect but not so long that you weren't able to properly respond to it
somewhere in the one minute range seemed to be about right for something that would have forty five minute periodicity
and i think the next topic will be rcs processor
and that is a good point to take the break
before we break let me ask one historical question
the timeframe for the design of this was mid to late seventy s
we began the work in seventy five
there was a famous phase of seventy six which is the hay scrub which is where we realized that not everything can go onto one computer
the computer memory had to increase
the real design architecture of what was going to be the first flight started to gel in seventy six
the original expected launch date of the shuttle was seventy eight
it kind of stayed ahead of us a certain amount of time but we had probably ninety percents or ninety five percents of the design done by seventy eight
we're going through detailed flight verification and crew training with jeff being one of the crew members that was assigned to us
and we would go out to downey to do that in the seventy eight to eighty period
in the design now you refer to the state estimator and optimal control
by that time had that methodology been completely accepted as a substitute for the classical control design
oh yeah i think so
i think the phase plane concept first appeared actually in apollo
and there was sort of a rudimentary application of optimal control theory that was quite successful
by that time i think the aircraft zoom maneuver people were happy with that
the kalman filter work an early form of that also made it into apollo
i don't think we were actually pushing the envelope that much in using these things
we actually carried over
but apollo applying any of these technologies in the mid to late sixty s was very groundbreaking
any other questions before the break
ok
let's take five minutes
am i missing anybody
i know larry hasn't come back
close enough
ok
well i'm going to go into the rcs processor now
we've talked a lot about the presence of the phase plane
we're going to go into some of the details in the jet selection
important consideration of the jet selection is we had to accommodate failures maintaining control authority for any type of single failure thruster manifold string which you will see those later
and you also had to be able to maintain adequate authority for safety with two of those combined failures
we also had to limit plume restrictions accommodate the tank constraints
we talked about having couples not having couples the balance propellant in tanks to limit fuel usage when you didn't worry about translational coupling and minor orbital perturbations and all those other special maneuvers that we pointed out before they required higher authority
you had your manual modes going in and then you had all these steering modes which without orbit in addition to the ones we talked about discrete rate and pulse and acceleration and all that kind of stuff you had various landmark tracking modes orbital object tracking modes which were a guidance function providing inputs to the control loop that all had to be managed through a proper way of manipulating the phase plans
they were tracking the errors of matter with respect to the mode that you were in and then sending based on the errors being detected in the phase plane commands they would be processed by the jet selection logic
the principles of the phase plane we figured you weren't important enough to get started
you had a phase plane per axis
roll
pitch
yaw
you had switch lines which were shaped based on the expected torques
you always had a parabolic feature but much more complicated than just that
you added dead bands because you didn't want to fire
when you didn't know exactly where you were you wanted to be able to get in the general vicinity far enough from a firing zone that it would stay in the general vicinity for a while and then only fire when you had to when you were diverging from that
you had to deal in the transition phase with that rate gyro noise phenomenology
and you had to get the disturbance acceleration on orbit
what we did about all those maneuver modes is each phase plane had an origin the origin being zero with respect to sun frame and attitude and position
you could move that origin at a rate or you could increment its attitude position if you were commanding the vehicle to do something such as a tracking maneuver or a discrete rate
and that way the errors of the phase plane we're looking at with respect to where you wanted to be rather than in absolute sense
and you would always create in here so that if you had a big error you could spend a little bit of fuel to get to somewhere which would cause you to go in the right direction without continuously firing the jet
whereas if you truly followed the parabolic switch curve you would just keep firing the jet until you were back to the origin which can be quite costly
so i am going to show you this picture and then the on orbit one
these are the residual parabolic switch lines which in the optimal control theory would be going through the origin
and then if you're out over in these region out here you will always fire a jet meaning a plus direction or the minus direction
you're inside here
you will fire until you hit another switch line on the other side
the expectation is that you're coming in this way or you're coming in this way
you want to get to a point where you're not likely to fire again for a while
but then you also would be concerned because you don't automatically want to fire back right away because the rate gyro noise phenomenology could cause where you think you are with respect to that line to move back and forth causing you to fire too soon causing the fire again to reverse that and get in trouble
so what we actually did is if you actually hit this line and began to fire each time you fired up to two or three times it would move the line out temporarily so that the quantum noise from that mdm would not make you think even though you were moving this way that you were going back out
because if you fired that jet again not only would you be spinning the propellant to go faster you'd hit the other line a lot faster still
for every time you double the size of the impulse that you use to reverse your rate you're quadrupling the total propellant time
because if you double the propellant each time you hit a surface twice as fast before you get to the next one
now on orbit we didn't have that noise problem so we don't have that moving switch line there
but we have this moving switch line
if you're coming in you're looking to hit the zero line and cut off but here you're not going to cut off until you hit the disturbance acceleration line
it is expecting when you hit that that the predicted acceleration is going to say you're going to go up this way
that means it will be longer before you hit another surface than if you start doing that over here
so this one is a trick to lower the frequency of the jet firings based on other knowledge that we had about the acceleration
jet selection
we had entirely different laws for the primary and the vernier
the verniers had a very complicated configuration had to be able to be fault tolerant be able to handle simultaneous translation rotation commands
it turned out because of throughput processing limits the correct approach was something like a table lookup
but we had all kinds of rules we went through to say which kind of table did we want to go to
what are the consequences of failures
do we want to start modifying the commands we've received because of what we basically know about which jets have failed and what we no longer can accomplish
we actually had a bullion implementation of those tables that actually got implemented as tables because we developed algorithms and ibm converted the software
and they didn't necessarily do exactly what we told them
subsequent to that there was an experiment on the shuttle called a phase space autopilot which is based on looking for velocity changes and optimal combinations of jets
you would go through a linear optimal search and find the combinations
that was flown a couple times for a few hours on shuttle
the experiment was quite successful but never converted into a basic shuttle capability
but certainly with the processing capability that you have now would be a very good option as an alternative to what we did
the vernier jets which were only used on orbit only had six jets
we weren't trying to deal with redundancies so an entirely different kind of scheme was done there
we were looking to find the jets with respect to a three axis command which best contributed to producing rates in that direction
we could find a first jet that would be the best jet
and then we could see given how good that one is is there another one which is half as good
if so we would pick it
and if we found one half as good we might say if there is another one which is half again as good we might pick that and end up with an aggregate number of jets we would turn on to start producing the command
this would be based not just on whether or not the phase plane said you should have a jet fire in an axis but also on how big the error was but not yet to the point of hitting the phase plane line in the other axis
and so the composite vector you were trying to neutralize would be a combination of the command and error reduction on the other axes
and you would find the jets which would then respond your command and reduce the errors on the other axes
now we would not re compute that every cycle
if we found that the ones or minus ones in the three axes for the commands were not changing
even though the fractional values and the uncommand of axes were changing for up to five cycles we would not re compute the jets
and that would minimize the duty cycles which was a life issue on the jets
and then there was the other phenomenology i mentioned which is you start having large payloads or you're attached to mir or something like that
mass properties are very different
we don't know about that unless the crew tells us but we could put a discrete number of alternative configurations in the tables for what we expected accelerations of the jets would be
the crew could tell us which one applies and then it would do this selection based on that
the vernier algorithm looks something like this flow chart
whereas the primary algorithm would probably fill a fifty page flowchart
the vernier algorithm was very simple
you go through and have a command vector which was ones and minus ones or fractional values
depending on whether or not phase planes have commanded an axis or just had a bias because of an error in that axis
you would do a dot product of the six jets
you would look for the maximum value of that dot product of the acceleration and the command
and then based on that value of that dot product you would see if there was one that was half as good
and if there was one as half as good you would see if there was one that was a quarter as good
and then if we already selected we would be doing this counter of up to five times where we wouldn't recomputed
now i was just talking during the break about one of the constraints on here
when we were using these computers the dot product of a three vector by three vector took about one millisecond
we had an eighty millisecond cycle
and in that eighty millisecond cycle seven to ten milliseconds could be allocated to control some of the guidance and some of the other functions
six milliseconds was being used to do these dot products
that is why we never could have considered doing something like that for the primary jets
the tvc processor we have instead of discrete control with thrusters we have nearly continuous control because we're doing gimbal steering up to the nonlinear effect of a gimbal limit
remind them what tvc is
thrust vector control
moving the thrust of the oms engine by steering the gimbals on which it is attached which you cannot do with the rcs thrusters
what we would do then is cross product steering
you have an error vector and a thrust vector and the cross product between the two could tell you the direction you needed to steer the vehicle to turn into the desired direction you wanted to thrust
that steering command was then used to determine the commands we sent to the gimbals for moving the engines
you had manual and automatic modes for doing that
generally we were limited to two degrees per second because the gimbals were fairly slow
we didn't want to get ourselves in a situation where we over steered and had to correct back which would take a lot of time and maybe cost us some propellant
but if we got into trouble the reaction control system could wrap around
and that could happen automatically if the errors got big enough or the crew could induce that by hitting the hand controller
and you have the two pads going into the manual auto mode
and manual always overrides auto from any of these operations
we had a lot of things we had to tolerate in determining our filter gains
we didn't always know the thrust direction engines all that way because of mechanical misalignment
when you build this thing an additional misalignment occurs after you launch the thing causing changes in the gimbal drive connections a little bit
there are errors
you rotate to a desired burn direction with the rcs jets before you light the engines
you're never exactly there when you start up
you can have failures during burns
an engine can shut down
an actuator can stop driving
if it is the oms one burn in the early shuttle days during that burn they were dumping the residual oxygen and hydrogen in the feed lines for the main engines during the burn causing torque disturbance on the vehicle that we had to overcome
the oms burn actually helped drive that fluid out of those lines
and then of course we had steering noise and bias
and then we had to have margins for things that all liquid propellant vehicles have
slosh flexure actuator nonlinearities and sample rate effects
now we had a design and then we had to change it
and the reason we had to change it is we flew for a little while and we discovered that these brushless electric motors being used for the oms actuators were turning on and off at a high enough rate during the burns that they were overheating making a hundred mission life maybe two or three missions
and they could take the pods off but they were fairly hard to get and expensive to maintain
so they asked us to change the bandwidth
and that's what we did beginning with the twelfth shuttle flight making these changes here
and that caused a little bit more sloppy behavior at the beginning and the end of the burn but didn't make very appreciable difference on the performance and made a big difference on the actuator life
there was an outer loop just showing where the cross product steering comes in and the fact that there are various filters and digital compensation effects that are going into this to deal in an adequate manner with all those effects that i listed a few minutes ago
the wraparound was there because we have the means to cover for large perturbations
why not implement it
i mean the situation you always have with human space flight if there was a capability you can take advantage of in a contingency scenario put it in
this also changed though between the first flight and the twelfth flight
and the reason we found is that you put this contingency capability in but when you really study it you realize you can actually take these two fundamentally different control laws and cause them to interact adversely
we could perturb it and then induce the jets to fire in a way that would cause it to counteract the effect that the thrust vector control system was doing
so when we lowered the bandwidth we also changed some of the parameters in there to in combination preclude that first flight
this is a case where we continued to evaluate the baseline system after we were flying and discovered additional potential unanticipated deficiencies that we should fix which is saying you're never done analyzing the system even after it starts flying
the maneuver and track modes i mentioned that they were there but we had this universal pointing display that the crew could manipulate
yes
on that last general comment on the last subject of discovering issues and potential problems after the system is flying
you're doing the analysis
you're doing your research
what in general were the reactions of your nasa counterparts when you bring that to their attention
would they call for an immediate fix before the next launch
it depended on the nature of the problem
and let me mention two or three of them at one time
i mentioned one about that phenomenology for the excitation or the rocking motion on the tank
and then another one with the vernier jets which i will explain in a moment
the external tank one had to be fixed before a second shuttle flight
there was one that potentially created a dangerous situation
tank separation violated safety of flight rules
this one was a potential wraparound interaction
it could only occur if you already had a significant contingency under fairly complex conditions
and if the crew knew about it there was a procedural way to temporarily inhibit the reaction control system interactions stopping the effect
because there was a crew workaround they knew about the problem it was deemed acceptable to go some number of missions for an already scheduled software update to insert it
now the third problem discovered as a result of analysis of sts one and three was a plume and pendulum phenomenology of the down firing aft jets
the body flap sticks out as kind of a random position on orbit and the down firing thrusters part of their plume hits it
they had evaluated that effect for the primary jets because they knew in the direction they pointed and their lower expansion ratio in the vernier jets there was going to be a problem
and that was properly dealt with in the flight control system
they never modeled for the vernier jets but only discovered that the state estimator was not converging as well as expected on the first shuttle flight when using the vernier jets
and it turned out there was probably a twenty percents or thirty percents net reduction in thrust and a fifteen or twenty degree effective change in the direction of the thrusts those two down firing verniers
and the feed forward estimation from the rcs jets as a result was giving the wrong data in the state estimator causing a jump in the value and a long time constant to settle out
and that was causing a few percent increase in the propellant consumption but probably a factor of ten increase in the duty cycles of the jets which was unacceptable from the life of the jets
that was compounded by a problem in sts three which is the first time they used the arm
and they actually put a few hundred pound payload and tried controlling the attitude of the vehicle in moving that payload
the combination of those things they went back and by sts five had to make serious changes to the phase plane estimation logic and tables for the accelerations for those vernier jets because they didn't want to burn those jets
i think after sts two they actually changed some of the jets
and then they didn't want to have to change them again
the maneuver mode
you want to do various types of maneuvers with respect to various frames of reference which could be landmark tracking local vertical tracking second spacecraft if you're doing a rendezvous tracking
guidance to provide that
that would be broken down into components by axis
and then there was an additional level of hysteresis about what you were telling the face plane to do
and i talked about adjusting the origin
this would decide whether or not you would adjust the origin
if you're error in a given axis with respect to what you wanted to do with the maneuver was less than twice the dead band you would not adjust the origin
and if it was more than twice you would
and again it is a case of why force it to do things it doesn't have to do if it's going to get there eventually anyway
and that is actually an adjustable parameter which for certain payload missions they might change that value from something else
there were these various direct manual translation rotation modes and the auto modes that i think bit by bit i have talked about
the reason you have these different references inertial and local vertical if you're doing an earth observation mission almost everything is going to be in a local vertical frame
you're going to have your payload bay pointing down
you want to keep it pointed at a certain spot
if you're doing a solar telescope mission everything is going to be in an inertial frame
you're going to want to keep it pointing at the sun or within a few degrees where maybe the telescope will have a limited travel of its own
if you're doing rendezvous then it's going to have to be you're accounting for the orb rates of the two vehicles
you're going to want to keep your rendezvous radar pointed in the right direction
by the way the rendezvous radar there is a deployable dish antenna that goes out of the payload bay the side of the payload bay of the shuttle
that is a dual purpose antenna
it can be used to point at the tdrs satellite to send data at high rates to the earth and track the satellite
or it can be used to point a radar beam at another spacecraft
it was not used for tdrs in the beginning of the program
it was only used for radar because the first tdrs was launched by sts six
electronic string and i think we're about at the right point of time on this too to allowing me to get into this in a little bit of detail
this was something that kind of crept up on us in importance
it was thought it would make the systems redundant have separate strings don't put them all on the same computer
all those things were recognized but i don't think until about a year a year and half before the first flight actually occurred that we realized how difficult it is to be sure that all the interactions of these strings the power string the pluming string and the electronic string and the possible combinations of failures how difficult it is to assure that you meet those high level failure tolerance requirements
and that is what i think i did in one thousand nine hundred eighty eighty one probably was the early form of fault tree analysis
and i have in a handbook i developed for the first flight a series what if tables with all these different breakdowns of what could happen
and actually a person that didn't know about probabilities and all looked at it
it was a pretty scary table when you looked at all the possible bizarre two failure combinations
but first you've got to understand what the strings are
you would have one forward one aft left one aft right so three boxes three half boxes and multiplexers demultiplexers on a string
and there were two mdm boxes in each pod forward left right aft
and the electronics were broken apart into each half box
so you actually had in effect four sets of electronics in each pod even though you only had two boxes
and one card from each of those boxes would be dedicated to string but each string would have a card per pod
so three cards would be tied electronically to one computer anomaly
now you couldn't take a string that could be commanded by more than one computer
the computer saw the data from all four strings so they could vote the data to decide whether or not each of the computers was healthy but they could only command one string
i should say each string could only be commanded by one computer but you could if you started losing computers latch up more than one string to one computer
even though one string could only take commands from one computer more than one string could take commands from the same computer if that became necessary
if you lost a computer and were in a benign environment and you wanted to recover all those systems that happened with the first computer failure in sts nine then you would manually re latch those strings to a healthy computer
of course if that computer went down then it would take two strings down
there was a unique latch up of these string components to power systems but it wasn't necessarily one to one
and that is where things got very complicated when you start crossing the subsystems where one power system could cause some subsystems to fail on more than one string
then you take a string down
that would be a very different failure scenario than taking two strings down
this is showing how the thrusters laid out
you can see there are a lot of thrusters on each string
if you go back and look at the vehicle carefully and you look at the down firing thrusters
you will see that in the front of the tank there are two thrusters that point down to the left and two thrusters that point down to the right candid out about forty degrees
that means that if you lose two thrusters two strings or two manifolds it was possible to lose both of them on one side
that is very important because that's one of the phenomena we had to protect against for separating from the external tank
and it becomes a highly coupled separation maneuver
and there were some special jet select tables created for that and some special control logic loops that were created just for that one scenario
you go through these things and certain critical events where things cannot fail even if your subsystems have failed twice
and the subsystems may not have been designed to make it very convenient but you still have to do it
that happens to be one of the scenarios we looked at a lot
and that we see forward down left down left or forward down right down right
so somehow you lose the thrusters these strings or whatever
that became a special design case
and there were a lot of those kinds of things
i would say seventy percents or eighty percents of our design time goes into learning those special cases
with the thrusters the manifolds are basically the valve lines so there is a commonality between the electronic stringing of manifolds in those valves
with the oms that's not really true
the way the oms engines work each engine is actually an oxidizer and fuel tank going into two loops of lines each with two valves
at least one valve in each path had to open to feed fuel
at least both valves in one loop had to close to stop fuel from flowing
any combination which would leave two open after a burn started or would leave two closed before the burn started was a problem
then you have pressure sensors
and there was only one per engine
you lacked insight into whether or not the engine started based on pressure if one of those failed
the stringing of this was not the same as the electronic string so we had to start looking at the possibility of individual valve failures and electronic string failures
taking down other valves
did that happen before an engine started after an engine started
how did that correlate with then influence on the same engine's actuator control
we could get situations where we could start the engine but we couldn't steer it engines that we could steer but couldn't start it and so we ended up with this maze of tables looking at those situations coming up with contingency designs
sometimes reverting to using the xrcs jets under severe multiple failure scenarios that actually do deorbit burns
we talked about what could go down
all of these things could be lost with a single failure though not all strings have an imu because there are only three
and only two of the chamber pressure
some strings were more important than others with respect to a subset of the systems
and since there are only two thrusters on one manifold per pod of the verniers there are also only three strings that affected those
all this got set up so that any one failure was quite manageable but the moment you talked about any possible two failures was when it became much more complicated
generally where we ended up after lots and lots of special design accommodation was we tolerated loss of translation control in the axes that were not necessary for managing deorbit
we tolerated degradation and rotation control but assured that we retained it at least in a time average sense in all three axes
the biggest complexity here was assuring we still had adequate time averaged translation and rotation control for tank separation
so we would pull away without recontacting the tank
remember recontacting the tank meant tiles hitting the tank
those tiles are really fragile
they can survive thousands of degrees but not much impact
we accommodated the scenario where we could lose all thrust vector control on the oms engines and still do a deorbit burn usually with rcs wraparound properly designed
and we had to accommodate the situations where mdms did not reset so everything tied to an mdm would be lost
and that is the kind of situation where you start having valve here a valve here a valve there being shut down along with a bunch of jets
and the real pain was understanding what things could collectively go down together
you had to lay out all the faults all the things that could happen with each of the faults and then overlaying the combinations of those
and then you would find it wasn't everything you were worried about
it was usually a small fraction but those few fractions drove the design details and effort to a great degree
now on orbit because you would often being using one imu and you only had two computers one of those strings going down meant you lost your navigation base
but because you're in a relatively benign environment restringing and bringing up another system wasn't a problem
if you were doing terminal rendezvous with the space station you would not be in a one imu mode
you would be in a three imu mode on two computers but you would not lose your navigation base
if you lost a computer at a critical point in that you would probably abort the rendezvous reconfigure again and resume your operations
one of the ground rules for all rendezvous operations with the shuttle and i think will be true of the cve is an rendezvous operation planned to do has to be able to be repeated at least once
the way i want to end this and then we could have questions is two pictures before and after cockpit upgrade on the shuttle
this was the way the shuttle was for many flights
those are crt displays green monochrome where no images could be drawn except little sticks dots and lines and rudimentary
these are analog tape measures analog eight ball with analog needles for attitude and rate information
and really very one thousand nine hundred seventy s
comment on that
one of the things that we did as payload specialists is we got some training in the cockpit and that was the version that was available in the early ninety s when i was down there
and you would go from your desk at the johnson space center when you were using an imb think pad or something and you felt as though you had gone through a time warp when you went back to the simulator on what was the world's most expensive vehicle
it was extraordinary
and of course you could explain why this was kept on so long
well it was this multi seven digit figure for its upgrade as well as the issue about recertification
and let me mention both of those in a moment point out a couple of things and get back to that before i show you the current configuration
the amount in the shuttle versus the amount to support the shuttle
in the shuttle because
well you only have a one hundred four k memory computer
you have the actual number of lines that are
yeah you had the one hundred four k for the backup system the one hundred four k for ascent and entry the one hundred four k for on orbit the one hundred four k for system management
and then there have been other things where their own software capabilities have been added in subsequent years
so it is a lot of software now but human validation means if you make small change everything has to be reassessed for possible interaction to a degree that you would never do for a mission that doesn't put human safety at risk
that means the cost of doing that each time is probably an order of magnitude higher than it would be for an unmanned system
you look at what it was going to take to put a cockpit upgrade in there
we're talking hundreds of millions of dollars to do it for the fleet
and when i say hundreds of millions a couple hundred million
it did eventually get done as i will show you in the next picture but the main reason was obsolescence rather than wanting to be contemporary
you cannot buy these pieces to replace them anymore
the companies that actually made some of these systems may not exist
or if they do they have no economic incentive for maintaining the base for a customer that may buy another five of them
and so one of the things you have to deal with when a system is going to do this many years another example of that is the b fifty two or the triton missiles or things that stay in operation for a long time is you have to plan as part of your operation cost for periodic upgrades to mitigate obsolescence
in some program they had some support
it was digital microcomputers
we had a room over in the hill building that had about one hundred of them stacked up as backups
i don't think the boxes ever got opened
i think the program did the buy but the program never lasted as long as it was supposed to
but you are right
you can try to buy it
but even so even unused systems had a shelf life
and you don't know how good they are going to be thirty years later
if you had asked me in one thousand nine hundred seventy eight how long the shuttle was going to fly before it was replaced i would have said ten years maybe fifteen
before the columbia accident they were talking about another twenty
it is only the safety issues now that are going to make them stop it soon
anyway the other thing i want to point out here this is the crew interaction mechanism a push button display
no such thing as gui
that is unheard of in the shuttle
can you talk a bit about the hand controllers
are they the same ones used for landings that are also used for docking
i mean was it the same hand controller for everything
it is the same hand controller for everything except there is another station in the back
i didn't bring a picture of it which is used for docking
the cockpit you're looking out the forward windows you turn around and there is another set of cockpit instrumentation hand controllers
and there are two windows above you and two windows looking on the payload bay
and there are also controllers there for the arm
everything related to the arm is done looking out toward the payload bay
the arm is attached there
when you are doing rendezvous you're looking out at the overhead windows of the vehicle you are approaching
so in effect you have a couple of these crt displays and identical hand controller and the equivalent then or the updated equivalent now of these displays on a back station
to avoid any issues of changing controllers and changing viewpoints you might note that normally the controls that are done out of the back window with that separate controller and separate displays are done by different crew members
that is typically a mission specialist's job not a pilot or commander job and so they are separately trained
right
that's an important point
for rendezvous and docking it is the pilot or commander who uses the aft controls to control
do you know
i believe that everything related to the rms that you said is correct
but for a rendezvous the commander is always involved
but the point was that in that case that is done out the rear window
it is still done at the rear window so he has got to mentally reverse his frame of reference while he is doing that
that is correct
and that is something that i think will not be done with the cev
the same frame of reference will be used on the cev because i think that has always been a little bit of a point of contention in the problems of maintaining simultaneous proficiency
for remote manipulation with the arm that has been an issue
yeah
and i think that has always been done by uniquely trained mission specialists
that's right
today's cockpit looks a lot more like what you will see on a commercial airliner vintage mid eighty s the late eighty s perhaps but still more familiar where you've got glass multicolored displays
the eight ball still exists in image form because that is what a lot of the astronauts used to learn how to fly these vehicles
they still fly with respect to it except it is a digital representation but you're still not with the gooey environment
you still won't have touch pads or a mouse
it is all pushbutton displays
and there is a case to be made that touch displays or touch screens don't work very well in a vehicle where you g environments keep changing
it is very difficult to get a touch display that works with a light touch and a heavy touch when you're in zero g or when you're pulling several gs
even if the technology was space qualified it is not clear that they would use it except on a vehicle that stays in a constant environment
at this point let me introduce doctor hayashi
miwa hayashi is in fact at nasa ames research center now was here at mit and worked on the design of the next generation of the shuttle cockpit upgrade
in fact that is what you will be talking about in ten minutes across the hall in the sixteen point four hundred class
it is essentially what would have been done if shuttle life had been extended
i might add that although the room is very crowded if a few of you would like to sort of hear where this story would have gone you're welcome to come across the hall to four hundred nineteen and hear doctor hayashi
and you are also giving a lab meeting lecture at one point zero
could you tell us that subject
that is about the astronaut scanning behavior
our team had a model about the astronaut's scanning behavior in the cockpit this upgraded cockpit
anyone interested in this kind of topic you are welcome
it is from one point zero pm thirty three thousand two hundred six
thank you
go ahead phil
well at this point i think i'm open to a few more questions
we have a couple of minutes for further questions any topic we've covered or that's related that we didn't cover
yeah
you talked a lot about the constraints of the invented computers
well we had very large facilities for that purpose that evolved over time
the first major facility was the flight simulation laboratory in downing california which was then rockwell
you had a room with a couple cockpits you had another room which had the digital interfaces of the cockpit and a half a floor with the analog computers that provided a lot of the information generation at a rate that was not achievable with digital systems
you had this hybrid system for driving what were man in the loop simulations
and we spent twenty four hours a day seven days a week using those labs for several years
i would often go out to california and be on the five point zero pm to five point zero am shift often spanning weekends
by the way i was doing that i think when i was still a graduate student which was kind of an interesting experience
but then nasa built the shuttle avionics integration laboratory in houston which eventually superseded the laboratory at rockwell
that became an all digital system
the hybrid systems went away
the high capacity computers they could fit in one good size room everything they needed and were able to get much more digital displays for the crews
sometimes what they used to do for the imagery of the crew in the early days is they would actually drive a camera across a simulated scene because you couldn't generate the scene
by the time they got the sail facility developed they were able to do scene generation with fairly high computers
now everything could almost be tabletop
i mean it is just so dramatic as how this evolved over the years
the one thing they had at rockwell that never got replaced though is they also were able to put into the loop actual hydraulic systems
when they were doing entry they could turn on aero surfaces and hydraulics with simulated loads
and you always knew when they were doing it because the high pitch scream of the apus when they were doing it you could hear two blocks away
ok
last question
sir i was wondering if you could give kind of a concept of the cost of developing the software either in man hours or in comparison of what they spent on the hardware
well the initial development of the system probably involved the equivalent of fifteen or twenty full time people for a few years
and this was to develop the algorithms and support the validation
the actual flight software was actually produced by ibm separately
and they had a small team of people that would take the detail design specifications and create the software
it is a big effort but a very small part of the cost of developing a shuttle
i mean you measure the shuttle in billions
you measure the flight software development in millions
one thing that i remember when the software was developed and we were working and validating it ibm wanted every line of code change in million dollars
a million dollars for one line of code change because they had to verify the whole software
that is why you would never unless there was a flight critical thing do that
nasa wanted generally whenever possible to aggregate changes for a year or maybe two years sometimes
and then put them in there just for that reason because there was this huge cost of revalidating
and that was the ibm cost
it would be a cost to bringing us back in to certify that too
well it worked and you should be very proud of it you and your colleagues
thank you very much phil
thank you
welcome everybody
we are extremely fortunate and proud to have with us today christopher kraft
actually christopher kraft jr
he told us last night that his father christopher kraft was born within about a block of columbus circle and that is how he picked up the name christopher columbus kraft which was passed onto chris kraft jr
i don't really need to say very much by means of introduction because chris kraft is a name that has been associated with america's space program since the very beginning
and actually from the very beginning of his career right after he graduated from a university in virginia he went to work for the old naca the national advisory commission for aeronautics one point zero and eventually the director of the johnson space center which is the home of human space flight in this country
he had that position through one thousand nine hundred eighty two which was the end of the original orbital flight test phase of the orbiter
so he really was in charge of the space center when the space shuttle was being developed
and of course this course is of course in the systems engineering of the space shuttle
i just want in public here to acknowledge that there have been expenses involved in bringing all of the special lecturers that we have had who have participated in this course
and would not have been possible without the support of the draper laboratory
and we thank doctor eli gai who has provided that support
we couldn't have done it without you and we really appreciate it
that is enough for me
we all came here to hear chris kraft talk about the invention and development of mission control and the systems engineering and development of the space shuttle
i will tell you that chris kraft is somebody who is not afraid to express his opinions
and we are looking forward to hearing them
chris
good morning
it is not hard but sometimes difficult to return to mit where i have a lot of friends who came this morning
they sort of overwhelmed me then and i am sure they would overwhelm me now if we got into some deep technical subject about which i knew very little at the time
and i will say a little bit more about that
what i did want to say though is that the people that preceded me in lecturing to you you've been very fortunate
because they indeed are the stars of the space shuttle
they did a fantastic job
and i hope you got that sense from them as they spoke to you
they are the best
and if i were going to say two things about management that i have learned in my lifetime the first would be you are absolutely no better than the people around you
without a lot of great brains around you you're not very good no matter if you're the best person in the world
and too many people have learned that the hard way and not recognized that fact
the second thing we talked about last night around dinner and that was the second thing you learn as an engineering manager is that every day is a compromise
everything you do you have this idealistic view of doing it the best way possible doing it better every day doing it without worrying too much about the cost too much about the budget too much about schedule
you go in with that idea
but those things you have to face every day and so managers become great compromisers
if the systems that you end up with are not what you really wanted but if you're smart they do the job
if i were going to add two things to your education at mit that is where i would come from
the third thing i would say is that whether you like it or not you people sitting here
no you old heads but you people sitting here are the people that are going to do the next space program
you are the ones that are going to take us back to the moon if and when we get there
it is going to be up to you to do the job
in one thousand nine hundred sixty eight the average age of my organization and i think i was forty four was twenty six
we had an awful lot of young people who did the job and did it extremely well
the guy sitting there on apollo eleven screaming into his headset that it was still go i think was twenty five years old at the time and he was a veteran
and if he hadn't been a veteran he sure in hell was a few minutes after he kept yelling into that microphone that it was go
and i hope you've seen that on television
if you haven't it's a really great moment in apollo
let me start from the beginning
in project mercury we started with a space task group of thirty five people eight of which were secretaries
and those of us that came out of the naca the national advisory committee for aeronautics were smart guys
we were very capable people but we didn't know a damn thing about how to fly in space believe me
if you would have asked us at the time how do you get fluid out of a tank at zero g
i don't believe you would get the right answer from more than two guys
maybe max faget would have said well you've got to put a bladder in there and put pressure behind it and squeeze the stuff out because it is going to be floating
you don't know where it is in the tank
and secondly how much have you got left in a tank
kind of an interesting project if you don't know what zero g is all about
when we started in project mercury we didn't know much about systems design for space
we certainly had high questions about man's capability to perform a task in space
and i would say ninety eight percents to ninety nine percents of the medical community in the united states thought that the astronaut when he got there would be a blithering idiot that he would probably swallow his tongue that he couldn't see because his eyeballs were bulging out or that because of the worry he was going through he would have a twenty four hour ulcer sitting on the pad
and they would suddenly have to be at his side the medical community thought
that is where we were coming from so we decided we're going to put man in space
it was a daunting task but one which most of us realized from the get go that we were in the middle of probably man's greatest adventure
believe me
we did know that
i felt it and i think everybody felt it
it was sort of a euphoria
and we were in what you might call engineering euphoria like ed white was on gemini four
when he was outside the spacecraft i am absolutely certain he was euphoric
the press said he must have been euphoric
and i said oh no he was worried about doing the right things and doing all the right things at the right time
he was euphoric
and you don't recall but they said something finally at the end of that
they said well what does the flight director have to say
and i said get him back in the spacecraft as loud as i could say it
i think that is only one of the few times i have ever spoken on the air to ground
we were faced with putting somebody into this new environment for the first time
and how do you do that
what are the problems you are faced with
when we began to think about how we did flight tests on airplanes you would sit it on the ground and you would write a flight test requirement a set of things you wanted them to do on a flight
you would sit on the ground hold a microphone and talk to him
and he would say i just did so and so
and if he was one of the best test pilots he probably didn't tell you damn thing
they just kept quiet like neil armstrong did most of the time
he just kept quiet
and you kept having to prompt them to tell you what they were doing
that is where we were coming from
we had instrumentation
we had been developing telemetry from the bomb drop tests that we had made at langley
so we knew quite a bit about telemetry
we knew very little about air to ground
we knew that we would like to talk this guy about fifteen minutes or so
that is what you did when you went across the country as an airplane pilot
if you're going around the world we would like to talk to them about every fifteen minutes
and so we got out the geography books and said well we're going to fly around this thing and here is what this chinese finger puzzle looks like as it goes around the earth
and we are going to be over this part of the earth and this is where insertion is going to take place and this is where we're going to do orbit determination and this is where we're going to do retrofire
and we are going to be up there going around this particular section of the earth
and you looked at the geography and said well we've got a tracking range in cape canaveral
we've got tracking range on the west coast
we have a few radars in australia
but if we're going to speak to them every fifteen minutes this is where we would like to be
and so we end up saying well there are the canary islands there is kano there is zanzibar there is muchea and australia and so on
and immediately said well if we're going to have to talk to them we're going to have reception there so we're going to have to build a station at each one of those locations
and then we're going to have to tie them all together
and lord have mercy here we are with a whole requirement to build a worldwide network and nobody to do it with thirty five people to do it with
and so we immediately got a group together
and we got western electric and bell labs and a bunch of people like that and started building the worldwide network
that was a heck of a project to do at that point in time
and just the diplomatic requirements in all the states that we had to deal with around the world was a project in itself
having done that we just said how many times around the earth do you think we would like to go or need to go on the first flight
and what do you think would determine that
well in one thousand nine hundred fifty nine if you put a spacecraft up from cape canaveral or from vandenberg air force base and you asked is it in orbit of the then flight director he would say i don't know
i will tell you when it comes up over kodiak alaska forty five minutes from now
and i am saying to myself well if this thing isn't in orbit and i want to bring it down in the water before it hits the coast of africa i have got to know when to turn that spacecraft around and fire the retrorockets
i have to know immediately or at least within two or three minutes to turn the spacecraft around and fire the retrorockets what the orbit is
because if i don't i don't know where it is coming down and i don't know where to send the ships to pick that young astronaut up
realize that in one thousand nine hundred fifty nine nobody knew what a short arc solution was from a c ban radar in thirty seconds of data
furthermore they didn't have a computer to do it with
we were slide rule people marchant computers crank computers
and you were suddenly faced with the fact that you've got to build a computer system to take radar data from cape canaveral and bermuda massage that data and within thirty seconds of the short arc solution tell the people that have got to turn that spacecraft around and fire the retrorockets in two minutes
today that sounds unbelievable
when you talk about air to ground communications or ground to ground communications in africa the best you had was twenty words of teletype per minute
now you've got to know what is going on in the spacecraft or what the astronaut said as he flew over kano nigeria
you were going to get it back in twenty words of teletype
how do you make real time decisions under those circumstances
what is a real time decision
where are you going to make a decision
do you need some central facility which invented mission control
and suddenly then if we're going to do this job and we're going to have people looking at this data we have got to train a group of people to go to all these locations around the world
and if you're going to make decisions in a central location then you've got to have some means of getting that data back to them of massaging that data letting people know outside the limits of that control facility what is going on so they can interrelate with each other
nobody had ever done that before
and the first time we cranked ourselves up in a bunch of small cubby holes in an old wind tunnel building in langley field virginia and started doing what we would call the initial simulations we found that we didn't even know how to talk with each other
and everybody was talking at once
and so we had to invent a whole new language and had to have negative reporting and things like that which people had never heard of before
and rapidly then we began to realize that we had a big task in front of us
if you're going to recover this gentleman at the end of the flight that is not too hard
we can send a few ships out there
and we probably ought to have a helicopter there to pick them up
and maybe we could have one of these light carriers
but if the doctors are right we might have to come down anywhere in the three hundred sixty degrees on those three revolutions
now who are we talking to
we're talking about talking to the search and rescue people
we're talking to destroyer captains
we're talking to people that have got to fish this thing out of the sea
and how do they do that and how do they not get burned with the fuel that might be running out of the spacecraft
and suddenly we have to train probably ten thousand people on how to recover this machine
if the spacecraft is sitting in the water we've got to train several hundred frogmen how to jump out of an airplane with tools to get to the astronaut
it was a tremendous task for a group of people who had never done much but do wind tunnel tests or flight tests out of langley field virginia
the early days we had to come up with orbit determination
how to look at the astronaut's health
how do we get something down that we can look at
can we get an ekg down
can we get his breath rate down to each one of these stations so we know what the man's health is
an interesting story
we did eventually build a simulator to train the astronauts and we had no way of getting data to each one of these sites around the world that would allow us to run a full fledged worldwide simulation in real time
we would put it on tape
cut it up in sections
send out a script of what the astronaut was going to say and do
and play this six or eight minutes of a tape as that's what they would see as the spacecraft appeared over their station
and when we said we've got to train a bunch of doctors an interesting story was we went down to the veteran's administration in houston and said we'd like to put some instruments that we were developing on people that are sick here
and so as they come in various types of diseases
and fortunately one day we had a guy instrumented and he had a heart attack
we were able to record all of these things that were going on in this gentleman his temperature his ekg his breath rate what his blood pressure was and so on and put all that on the tape
and we sent that out to the remote sites
and then at each of the sites as this occurred had the doctors diagnose what was wrong with the astronaut
i don't believe in any one of the seventeen stations we had anybody diagnosed it as a heart attack
they all said he had an appendicitis or he was having some kind of shock take place to him because he was frightened to death
anything but a heart attack
so that was sort of classical of the things we did and improvised in order to get ourselves capable of running a worldwide operation which allowed us to make decisions in real time
now the other thing that we invented at that time i say invented it just came about by evolution was a book called mission rules
and that was probably the smartest thing we ever did
as we began to look at the spacecraft systems we started asking questions
if this system is failing what are the measurements that we're going to have there
and if it is failing and it isn't operating at the right temperature or the right pressure and it is off nominal what will the system do
and how do we measure that on the ground
how do we detect it
where is the instrument located on the system because it might be effected by the position it is located in the spacecraft
it might be hot
it might be cold
it might be suffering different kinds of pressures than it was measured on the ground
and as we began to ask those questions of the system engineer the system engineer
not systems engineers because i don't think we had any at the time
and they would say why the hell do you want to know that
the system is either working or it ain't working
and we said yes that's a good answer except that now we've got this system in space
and if we want to continue this flight and not have a contingency operation we would like to know how long the system is going to last if it isn't operating under normal conditions
that prompted us then to start thinking about how the system failed and what we were going to do about it
if the thermal system that kept the astronaut from getting hot or getting too cold wasn't functioning properly what could we do about it
how long could he stand being at a temperature of eighty five degrees inside his space suit
and then that said well if it stays there and we can only go x number of minutes what are we going to do about it
what is the rule of the game that says we should re enter or not re enter or go to the next primary recovery area et cetera
and it allowed us then to write down for every system and the man what we would do under certain circumstances
called those a set of mission rules
and that prompted us to develop a bunch of malfunction criteria
what malfunction procedures are you going to go through
and then that prompted us to ask the contractor and the manufacturer of the systems
and that developed a whole new set of schematics that they hadn't been used to
it cost us a lot of money to do that and they didn't want to do it
they didn't know why we wanted to do it
but as they began to see the mission rules we got those out in front of them and said we're going to do this with your spacecraft and your system
then they began to realize they better start thinking about those things
and that is what brought in my mind a group of people together in systems engineering because you began to find out how the systems reacted with each other
and that was a question that most engineers didn't think about
if the thermal control system is not functioning properly what does it do to the reaction control system
or as we had on one of our first orbital flights the seats on the small thrusters they were using for attitude control were not seating properly
and the experts said it is freezing
it is getting slush in the system and is causing the valves to stay open and they're not getting the proper fluid to it
so we put a thermostat on the next spacecraft and it wasn't freezing it was getting hot because the feedback from the thruster was getting on the lines and causing the seats to warp
and it was sitting there dribbling out and causing the attitude to be sloppy and jump around
and as a matter of fact on one flight we had to reenter early with the first chimpanzee flight because the machine was running out of propellant
it began to have everybody start thinking about how does my system fit with everybody else's system
how does that fit with the game plan that we're trying to come up with
and at the same time the organization then was able to look at all of these things that we said we were going to do and became a heck of a management tool
i remember james webb used to come down the administrator of nasa at the time and i would show him in the control center how we ran an operation and how we made decisions
and he was absolutely livid about that because he said that's what i want in washington
i want to be able to have those kinds of things put in front of me so i've got all these things so i can make a decision
i need you in washington
i want you to come up here and tell me how to build a system like that to do management
i must say that i have never been able to do that but he was very emphatic about wanting to do that
jump to the conclusion of mercury
i think we learned an awful lot form that program
we learned that man could do a job
he could do it just as well at zero gravity
particularly in mercury where he couldn't move around and he didn't get sick fortunately as he did eventually in some of our spacecraft
but certainly man could do the job in space as well up there as he could in a fighter airplane on the earth
but it was child's play
mercury was child's play
we put it up there we fired the retrorockets and it landed and then we picked them up
a hell of a job at that time but it was child's play
and so mister kennedy in his great wisdom in april of one thousand nine hundred sixty one when he saw the reaction of it we were all down in sheppard's first flight asked nasa what can we do to ace the russians
and nasa in its great wisdom said well probably in about ten years we can go around the moon
george low and others at washington had been doing some work on a lunar spacecraft
and in the great wisdom of whoever made such a decision the president asked why can't you land on the moon
now i want you to know that that was one thousand nine hundred sixty one and chris kraft did not know how to determine orbital mechanics from thirty seconds of radar at cape canaveral
and this man in one thousand nine hundred sixty one says we're going to the moon in this decade
and i thought he was a little daft
i must say i thought he was a little daft
the second day i thought a little bit better of it
and then about three months later when he came to make that famous speech in rice stadium
i was called back from cape canaveral to tell him how we were going to go to the moon
and i am telling you i did not know a damn thing about how to go to the moon
if you had said free return trajectory to me god i'd a thought it was a pass to the astro's baseball game
but here i was faced with the fact i've got to stand up in front of the president of the united states in a room much like this one only with about ten or twelve people in it and tell that gentleman how you're going to go to the moon
and that was a quick learn i'm telling a really quick learn from people like these guys john mayer and bill tindall taught me in a few hours how to do the orbital mechanics to go to the moon
not how to do it but what took place
here we were at the end of mercury
and we are going to then have to go to the moon
and how are we going to get there
and how are we going to train ourselves
what are the systems we need to do the job
what new control center do we need
what kind of operation do we need to think about
what kind of trajectory analysis do we need
and what kind of computers do we need
and what kind of communications do we need
suddenly we've got a whole new set of problems
if we're going to do rendezvous at the moon we've got to teach ourselves how to do rendezvous at the earth
if we're going to send something around the moon we better have a heck of a system to determine whether we are truly aiming at the moon or whether we're going to hit the moon
and in fact on apollo eight i wasn't sure that george miller who was the head of manned space flight was sure we weren't going to hit the moon when we told him that we wanted to do the trajectory as we were going to do it when we landed
then it ended up being sixty miles above the lunar surface as you entered orbit around the moon
and can you really tell me two hundred seventy thousand miles away whether the spacecraft is going to hit the moon when you are ten hours away or is it going to go around the moon
so we were faced with all those new problems
that is what got us to the gemini program
we wanted to be able to build a spaceship that would allow us to do maneuvering in orbit
that would allow us to stay up there fourteen days which is how long the spacecraft flight to the moon and back would be that would allow us to do reentry guidance using the l d of a blunt body enough to skip it out as you came back to earth and then go back up and then reenter at a much lower velocity so you wouldn't burn up the spacecraft
those are the kind of things we were suddenly thinking about as we built the gemini spacecraft
we needed an onboard computer
unheard of in that time period
the air force had been putting some on airplanes but never had we had on onboard a spacecraft
so gemini was designed to be a maneuvering capability in space to rendezvous and dock with a target to determine the capability of man to survive for fourteen days to do a heat shield which was much more flexible and reusable
and to build a maneuvering system
and finally to do guidance and control for landing point and control and develop a footprint on the earth for gemini which is what we were going to have to do on apollo
gemini was a very successful program
without it we could never have gone to the moon
we learned how to operate in space how to maneuver in space
we learned how to do eva which was a total disaster as we flew in gemini
i don't think we even by doing it five or six times on the final flight of gemini twelve
buzz aldrin was able to do a reasonable job in extra vehicular activity
we had to build a suit that was flexible to be able to walk on the moon
we had to build a backpack which was in truth another spacecraft to do apollo
we had to build a new control center because we had a computer which we actually doubled the storage capacity on mercury and then gave it sixty four thousand words
today you have that in some kid's thing that he carries on his airplane and one touch of his stroke
but sixty four thousand words was all that we had then
when we flew gemini we had a million words
when we flew apollo we had five point five million words so that computer complex was changing on us continuously
when we did mercury we used a grease pencil to write down the numbers as they came back from kano nigeria and twenty words of teletype
we had to build a new display system a digital display system with a computer
and the first digital display system was not graphics at all
what we did was build a slide that was the background for the display that you wanted
we had a set of four point five inch lantern slides a bank of one hundred for each station in the control center and then the computer filled in the numbers
now that was in one thousand nine hundred sixty four sixty five and sixty six
it wasn't until we got to the latter stages of apollo that we had computer graphics
i don't know whether you can realize that or not
computer graphics today is golly you have football games on computer graphics
but then we didn't have it so we had to redesign a control center and continuously redesign a control center
we had to have a computer controlled communication system
all of those things were built
we had to utilize and build in nasa the first communication satellite from which came the revolution in the world in my opinion
i want to go through apollo and things like translunar trajectories and free return trajectories and what might happen if you were off by a few feet per second or a few tenths of a degree when you fired the orbital maneuvering system of apollo on the backside of the moon which is where you had to do it for optimum performance characteristics
when the thing showed up as it came out on view on the front side of the moon and it was not in the right trajectory what the hell are you going to do about it
where is it going
is it going around the sun
is it coming back to earth
is it going to hit the moon
and what am i going to do about it if it is on one of those paths and my maneuvering engine
which has ten thousand pounds of thrust is not working or not working properly or it wasn't pointed in the right direction
you had to be prepared to think about those problems and make a real time decision as to what to do
i hope i am impressing you with that because that is what you guys are faced with in going back to the moon
it isn't just a simple problem of orbital mechanics
it is a problem of what are you going to do if it isn't correct if it isn't on the right path
if the system isn't working properly can you land
those things have to be thought out and thought out carefully before the fact not in real time
you can make all of the decisions in the compute which you would have made after you had thought about it in real time but think of the orbital mechanics problems associated with that in real time and the background then of the math and the thought processes that have to go into making those decisions
you're descending to the moon
and as one of these gentlemen sitting here you start to do the descent to the moon and low and behold you bring up the system on the lem and the abort light is on
what the hell does that mean
well it means if you start the engine right now it is going to start doing a rendezvous back with the command module
it is not going to land on the lunar surface
and i've got a computer program that is hardwired to do that job with
i don't have the capability of reprogramming it like you would have by just sending up a whole new set of software
how am i going to figure that damn thing out
i've got a thousand words of pad in this computer
is it possible in real time to obviate that abort signal and still land on the moon
and this gentlemen sitting over here figured that out
he figured out how to tell the computer to ignore that signal by going into the certain places in that hardwired software and saying don't listen to the abort signal for a while
don't listen to it but if i need to listen to it on the way down then listen to it
you've got to do that with a thousand words
that is a pretty tough problem in real time one which nobody had thought about before until it happened
or as i said this twenty five year old young man on apollo eleven and the vehicle is descending to the moon and he is getting all these signals back that says the computer is overloaded and is doing so many tasks and stopping
why is it doing that
we've done it on apollo ten when we started down to the moon and it worked fine and we did a rendezvous from it but we had the radar on
and going down to the moon we didn't need the radar on it
that radar was going into the computer it was flooding the computer with data but these guys didn't know that
they had to figure out how to get around that signal
if i sound like that is a big problem it is a big problem and it is going to get bigger
with a spacecraft you're going to get more complex with each passing day and you're going to have to figure out how to do that stuff in real time
and that is what you the flight operations people and the designers of tomorrow are going to be and that is what you're going to be faced with
i know you're working on the space shuttle trying to make it better
that is what your task is in this class
we should have had you around for the last twenty five years because it needs to be made better
and it is a travesty i will use that word again that we haven't been making it better and making it less costly to fly
we should have been doing that
let me start into the space shuttle a little
one of the questions that jeff asked me that these people will be interested in hearing is how did you decide to do it manned as opposed to unmanned on the first flight
sort of out of necessity i guess you would say
the more we looked at the systems the more we looked at the space shuttle the more we realized that the man could furnish us a certain amount of reliability in space operations and in space systems
and in choosing systems the more reliable the machine would become
but we had to convince ourselves that that was a rational thing to do
now let's go back and give you some thought process about the space shuttle design
as we did the initial design we wanted an escape system
we wanted to build a pod into the cockpit to allow the astronauts to escape if we had problems
and building the space shuttle main engine was very difficult
do these people know about sub synchronous whirl
they heard about it from j_r
we couldn't find any bearings in the world that would withstand that load
they were failing
and you didn't know when they were going to fail so we built an automatic shutdown system into the engine
and aaron and i were talking about that this morning with professor cohen
that was well we'll just figure out what all the parameters are that tell you when the engine is malfunctioning and shut it down because we don't want it to blow up
we are going to look at rpm of the pumps and we're going to look at temperature in the prompts and we're going to look at the pressure in the engine head and we're going to look at the fuel flow rates et cetera
that sounds like we can do that but how do you know it is right
how do you know you're not shutting down a good engine
and the point i am making there is that reliability of the instrument becomes more important than the engine
think about that
you can say i will have an automatic shutdown
i will have the automatic abort and get the astronaut away but somebody has got to make that decision
nobody on the ground can do it fast enough if the engine is going to blow up
the astronaut cannot do it
his reaction time is about one point five seconds no matter how much data you give them or how good the data is
so it has got to be automatic
and that is a very difficult task for an engineer
he can make this system work but he cannot tell you very rapidly when it is going to fail
and rocket engines have a bad nasty habit of going like that and it is gone
you've got to figure out when that is going to happen so designing instrumentation to do that
we then started thinking about that in application to the space shuttle
and our experience with redundancy reliability numbers thinking about that we said we want a system in the shuttle that is going to be fail operational fail safe
that is quad redundancy so every critical system has quad redundancy in the space shuttle
it sounds like a good idea doesn't it
we will come back to that in a minute
we said we would like to have an escape pod but the escape pod has got to have a stability and control system
it has got to have a control system because it is going to be a spacecraft
when is it going to use the pod
is the pod going to be used at one hundred feet off the pad one hundred thousand feet off the pad five hundred thousand feet off the pad
and if this thing is descending from any one of those altitudes how are you going to control it
very rapidly that is another spacecraft
it is probably a bigger job in building that spacecraft than building the space shuttle itself
so you can see why we didn't do it
it is too tough too big a job
we said we would like to have a go around capability on this machine
it is going to have an l d of about four to five at best and the descent angle that you come down to land is twenty three degrees
let me tell you something
i have flown in a gulfstream ii on a twenty three degree descent trajectory and that is scary as hell
you're flying a brick
that machine is coming down like that and you're hanging on your straps
we would like to be able to have a go around capability
ok we'll put some jet engines on it
it has got to have fuel
it has got to have a tank
it has got to have lines on it
it has got to have a certain amount of redundancy with it and a certain amount of power
it has got to be absorbed into the thermal protection system and come out and extend
what i want to do is go around as i'm reentering from space so i can go once around the runway and land
it didn't take us long to figure out if we built that system we couldn't carry a damn pound into orbit
there went our payload
and we very rapidly started figuring out how to do dead stick landings and how to preserve the energy and how to get this machine lined up on the runway at way high altitudes et cetera
so we did away with the go around capability
we've done away with the pod
we've done away with the go around capability
now we don't have an escape system
what is your escape system on the shuttle
well on mercury and apollo the escape system is a solid rocket
solid rockets have close to one hundred percents reliability as you can get
usually if it lights it burns and it goes
god we've got two solid rockets on the shuttle
why aren't they our escape system
because if we can get this thing to two hundred thousand feet it will fly
we can return to the launch site and land from two hundred thousand feet because you aren't very far down range at two hundred thousand feet
that is a good idea a great idea but the rockets have to be one hundred percents reliable
it wasn't one hundred percents reliable in the challenger accident
unfortunately i cannot account for the fallacies of man
and i will come back to that if you want me to talk about the challenger accident
but we built solid rockets to have one hundred percents reliability and they were our escape rocket
we've got quad redundancy we've got engines that will perform to the best of our ability and shut down if they are going to explode we've got solid rockets as an escape system and we will teach the pilots with the best control system we can come up with to land this machine dead stick
now we've got to convince ourselves and the management that the best way to fly this thing is unmanned or manned on the first flight
and we looked at flying it unmanned
we could have done that
we could have put an automatic control system in to take the place of man
and these pilots that tell you they do manual control during reentry in the shuttle hogwash
pure hogwash
the shuttle will not fly without the automatic control system
the pilots are flying the outer loop
i could fly it
i have flown it in the simulator
you know how i do it
i don't touch the damn thing
you set the damn end of the runway into the computer right down
and that's the way ninety five percents of the airliners land today on automatic control
and frankly that is how the astronauts ought to do it
they haven't done it yet
they keep telling me what are we going to do if the system fails
and i say to them you better wind your damn clock because if that system fails the thing is gone
it is an unstable machine
from mach twenty five to touchdown it is an unstable machine
if it diverges it is gone
if pilots tell you they are doing manual entry on the space shuttle i repeat that statement hogwash
it cannot be done
now i can teach them however by building a gulfstream ii into a space shuttle like vehicle
i can put the control system that they've got in there
i can repeat that
i can make it come down
i can put reverse thrust if you believe on both engines in a gii
and you're descending and you've got both those damn engines back there going like that as it does its reverse thrust to match the drag of the shuttle during entry
but i can teach them pretty well how to do dead stick landings
and so i put all that together
and professor cohen and myself and a few others go to washington to convince the powers that be that we can fly this machine manned on the first flight because it is the most reliable way to fly the machine
and we convince them
it took a little doing a lot of fancy talking i guess but that is what we decided to do
and i think it was a good decision
in retrospect it was a lousy decision
why
because if we had had unmanned flying capability on the orbiter and we had the challenger accident
we could have flown it again the next day with the unmanned control system and proved that it was ok
well we didn't have that capability
and when you get into the politics of flying men in space in this country rational thinking does not carry the day
political thinking carries the day even in nasa
you will find that out as young engineers also that you not only have to be an engineer you do have to be somewhat of a politician in order to sell your programs
we convinced ourselves that it was the best thing to do at that time to fly man on the first flight
because it is in my head and it comes out i want to say a little bit about the problems that they face today
or the way in which they use the space shuttle today is frankly not how we intended the machine to fly
we have quad redundancy
and the way nasa uses it makes it less reliable than if we had just had a damn single string system
why
because they have to have all quad redundant systems working at liftoff
so all four systems have to be operating at liftoff
that is hard
it is hard enough to have one operating properly
now you have to have all four in all the places where you have quad redundancy
that isn't how we intended it to work
what we intended it to do was you would get to the pad and get ready to launch and one system fails you would keep right on going
if you have two fail you keep right on going
that is the way we intended it to be because we wanted it to be a reusable system with quick turnaround
two weeks we want to be able to turn that machine around
and you could do that today because they've flown in one hundred and something times
they know that machine
they know it well
they know how the systems perform
you can look at the telemetry when it lands and say all three of the four were working and i've got a thing over here
i can fix that in ten minutes
i am ready to go
they put more time on the systems on the ground than they do in flight testing the machine
is that expensive
my god that's the reason it cost dollars four billion a year to keep all those running standing army at cape canaveral
if you're going to build redundancy in the future you guys if you're going to put redundancy in this machine don't tell them about it
now that may sound funny
but that is how your computer is designed
you don't have bite in your computer anymore built in test equipment
do you know why
because damn engineers kept using it
now the computer builders build in the test equipment but they don't tell you it is there
the redundancy works automatically
probably got three or four in there just like we do in the shuttle but your computer keeps working
it might be a little slower sometimes it can get you as mad as hell but they don't tell you about it
my advice is don't tell the people about it the next time
don't tell the people at the cape this thing has quad redundancy
now that is probably somewhat foolishness but i guaranty that if i had anything to do about it the next time i might very well do it that way because it is not the right way to think about this machine
the machine is a beautiful wonderful piece of hardware
the orbiter system the most complex system ever built by man to fly i was talking to some coops a few days ago i've said that word fourteen times it has never had a failure
the orbiter has never had a failure that would have prevented that machine from landing safely
nasa is now going to use however all of the components that have failed
they are going to use the solid rocket
they are going to put a command like service module on top of it with an escape rocket and fly it
that system has failed
they are going to use the tank
engineers this day and time cannot figure out how to put insulation on the tank
ridiculous
not only ridiculous
ludicrous
you mean to tell me there is not a design engineer sitting in this room that cannot tell you how to keep the foam insulation on that tank
hell my son could do it
in fact my grandson could probably do it
the space shuttle main engines now that is a damn tough piece of hardware
that is what we're going to use
that is what we're going to put in orbit and use as a propulsion system to send you to the moon
now they say we're going to make some changes to it and make it better
i will probably be dead and gone but i would like to see it
that thing is designed right up to the teeth
the maximum power you can get out of hydrogen and oxygen has an isp of about four hundred sixty and the engine on the shuttle is four hundred fifty eight
i don't know how you could get much more efficient than that but that really is a tough engine
you're continuously changing components on it
but those are the three components
nasa says i am going to use those to go to the moon but i will throw the orbiter away
never had a failure on the orbiter
we talked a little bit about rtls return to launch site
that sounds like something easy to do but think about the software involved in that little dude in figuring out how to do it how to take that machine back to land at cape canaveral if you do have an abort
think about the software involved in that
think about the possibilities
think about the cutoff conditions
think about the mach number range you're going to have to fly
return to launch site was part of our philosophy of not having an escape system per se on the shuttle
i know we have some navigation and guidance people in this audience
how then did we decide
jeff asked me to fly the first time
that was tough very difficult
we had some of the best experts in the world come review what we were doing and look at all the systems
the one thing two things really that they had the most trouble with in making sure we knew what we were doing
first was the thermal protection system
and we never really convinced the experts that we did have a thermal protection system that would work
as a matter of fact the man who invented lunar orbit rendezvous he didn't invent it but he sold the day in using lunar orbit rendezvous
and the chief structures engineer in the united states that is probably a stretch but one of them at stanford wrote me a cosigned letter on t minus one month after we had reviewed this system we had done everything they asked us to do
we ran combined loads test we ran worst loads test we ran combined worst loads test to prove to ourselves that the thermal protection system wouldn't fail
i got this letter at t minus one month
it is now in my effects at virginia tech
as a matter of fact virginia tech said are you sure you want this letter in your files
i said oh yes i want that letter in my files
it is probably the most important letter you will ever have in my files
but these two gentlemen said we implore you not to fly the orbiter because the tiles are going to come off
it may not come off while you're at the max heating pulse but by the time you get ready to land nasa is going to be totally embarrassed because all the tiles are going to fall off
and we would ask you to put a steel net around this vehicle so that they won't fall off
i am still aghast at that letter because i don't know what else we could have done to satisfy them that we had done everything they asked us
they were concerned that the strain isolation pad which is what the tile sits on and you've had that explanation they were concerned that the combined vibrations and aerodynamic loads would cause a failure in the sip or at least at the glue joint
and that indeed all the major tiles that had gone through the large heat pulse would fall off
professor cohen and i met them on the queen mary at an aiee meeting after the first flight had taken space
it was satisfactory
it flew well
it flew beautifully
those two gentlemen came running out and asked aaron if we could come and sit down and have a drink with them
and we said hell no and walked away from them
that is what i thought of that letter
say that again
we didn't get the last part
now the other thing i want to talk about is the control system of the shuttle
we had several gentlemen and said we are infinitely smarter today
yes i did
the public affairs officer said we need a comment from you after the machine had landed on what you think of this flight
i said we have just become infinitely smarter
not so much about the tile were we infinitely smarter but the story i'm about to tell
the automatic control system in terms of the aerodynamic parameters that it has to deal with there are roughly thirty five variables in the aerodynamics of the machine all the way from products of inertia to cnbeta
does everybody know cnbeta
cnbeta is the capability of the rudder to stabilize the machine the yawing moment due to side slip
and i still do remember a little bit of my aerodynamics
anyway there are no facilities in the world to measure those thirty five parameters very accurately anyway that would tell you what to design the automatic control system to
it is not so difficult at high mach numbers above say ten
you can use what do you call it newtonian flow
and as you well know you use the aerodynamic controls when you can
you use the thrusters when you can and you combine the two as you transfer from one to the other in the range of flight regimes
but actually it is a guess
we looked at all of the possibilities that had been done on the x fifteen had been done on the dyna soar program had been done in wind tunnel tests of almost every configuration for hypersonic flow
and you just couldn't nail down what those thirty five parameters were
what we did was said here is what we think it is here is a variation on top of that
and here is a deviation on top of that and here are those thirty five parameters throughout the total mach range
and we are going to do a monte carlo analysis at every tenth of a mach number from twenty five to touchdown and have no failures
and if we have a failure we have to change the gains and go back and run it again
i don't know about you
that sure convinced me that that machine would fly
but i still said we just became infinitely smarter
i said before we flew we certainly have to change the gains because there will be regions where the machine is oscillatory coming down and might frighten somebody even if it were going to damp
that was post flight
i said i don't ever want to change the gains
the damn thing worked
so those two problems were the fundamentally hardest problems to be able to test and assure yourself that you were ready to fly
but in the end how did we decide to fly
frankly i didn't know what else to do
in my mind professor cohen's mind john yardley's mind who was head of manned space flight
these gentlemen sitting in front of me that worked on the automatic control system we didn't know what else to do
we had done everything we could think of
we suspected that there were some unknown unknowns
a good old nasa term unknown unknowns
but we didn't know what they were
we didn't know how to test it so we've got to go light the torch and do it
i don't think it took a lot of guts or nerve
seventy one zero and the responsibility of the program because it may very well be something that just causes the space program to collapse in the united states
and that is a tough task
you don't learn that overnight
you just sort of have to learn to live with it
and frankly you have to like it
you have to like being in that position
i had one of my flight directors who became very much affected by it mentally
so affected that he quit and went and became a psychiatrist
did not ever perform as a psychiatrist but got his degree in psychiatry
phil shaffer if you know him one of my very closest friends
he is now making me kind of rich because we own a lot of oil wells in oklahoma together
it is a tough job but it is a marvelous job
there is nothing i can think of including pitching in the world series or winning the us open that comes close to being in this business
every day is a challenge every day is hell and everyday is the best feeling you've ever had in your life
that is how you feel every day
you go through those transients almost every day
i highly recommend it to you
i don't think you can get rich until you retire and become a board member like some of us have but before that you're not going to get rich but you're going to be happy every day
and you are going to feel like you contributed every day
and i don't know at least in our business anything better than that
and these gentlemen all sitting here in front of me will attest to that
it is a great life
with that i will stop and take your questions
chris well i'll start off
aaron can you stand up
yes
what would be the systems that you would think could use most improvement on the shuttle today
with today's technology and then as you see things what would be the systems that you think could use the most improvement in terms of performance margin
well again my first answer would be political
i would approve the thermal protection system
i don't think it has to be improved very much but it would sure get a lot of people off our backs if we improved the thermal protection system
and there are ways of doing that today
there are some advancements in the state of the art of the materials probably in the way you attach to the plow to the machine probably the way you proof test it
all of those things i think would be where i would go first
i would put an electric system in secondly
what about hydraulics
and get rid of the hydraulics because i think that is a maintenance problem
and i think that the apus are always going to be a problem because that is something that is turning up at four hundred thousand rpm a rotor that is about that big turning up four hundred thousand rpm
and because at four hundred thousand rpm actually instead of being this diameter is now an eight to a quarter of an inch bigger because the metal is stretching under those conditions
the valves we've had trouble with as you well know
the material where this thing is pulsing
and these are nothing new
there are designs there are electric motors there are power systems that would do it much better than a hydraulic system
those two systems i think are primary
now the other thing is you have to keep up with the state of the art
and one of the biggest problems you have with the shuttle today is nobody builds the parts anymore
you go to the manufacturers and they say oh we stopped building that system ten years ago
all the circuit boards and everything is pass
and that sounds like well we'll just change the circuit boards
well that is a tough problem because the process specs have got to be looked at
the sneak circuitry the sneak paths have got to be looked at because that was the thing that always got to us in space flight everything works fine and then some day somebody turned something off and the thing glitches and it fired the retrorocket or something like that
and so you have to be sure that when you do redesign the circuitry into the modern world that it is properly done
a lot of things you don't need on space shuttle probably you don't need the backup flight control system which costs a lot of money
and then i think the biggest thing i would do is force the system to use automated checkout
that is where all the money is i think
and maintaining the machine nobody is willing to use automatic checkout
it is there and you can do it very easily but the people at cape canaveral they need to be flight controllers
what i mean by that is the people at cape canaveral who prepare and maintain the machine have a totally different approach to the space machine than the flight controllers do
the people at the cape want it to be perfect when it is launched
and so when they do the checkout and it doesn't work right they go plug a new board in or they go put a new system in or change out the fuel cell
a flight controller does not have that prerogative
he has got to figure out how do i live with what i've got and make the best of it
i think that is the best attitude
and they need more of that in the maintenance side
i think that is where the biggest savings and the biggest improvement could be made in the space shuttle
the other thing i think about is the engine ssme
i think if you derated the ssme that the turnaround time on the engine and the reliability of the engine would go up significantly
if you derated the engine i_e instead of asking it to put out one hundred eight percents every time you go to the space station because you're going up to the higher inclinations
you just put a bigger head in it or whatever it takes to derate the engine
make it run at ninety five percents power
gee whiz the thing would last forever if you did that
chris you mentioned in your talk about going back to the moon
and i was going to ask you a couple of parts of the question
one is what for
two is it to go to the moon or is it set in stone to do something else
and then perhaps you could comment on what your prediction is for the space program for the us in the future
you're going to get graded on it
why go back to the moon
well i think that there are enough resources on the moon to make it economically viable number one
number two i think you could develop enough electrical power on the moon to provide enough power for the people that were going to live there and be stationed there permanently
and you would do it on the backside by the way not on the front side
that is where you would want your permanent base on the moon to be on the backside because it would be shielded from all the electronic signals from the earth
it is the best place in the world to look at the rest of the universe
i would build my space base on the backside of the moon
and then i believe there are possibilities although it is not technically sound yet
but i believe there are possibilities of providing enough electrical power to the earth from the moon that you could shutdown every power plant on the earth
you get that much electrical energy from the moon
and that would certainly offload the power requirements on the earth which are almost logarithmic aren't they
china is going to end up using more electrical power than we do shortly so we need electrical power
and i think you could get that from the moon
plus i think that the geophysicists and the geologists astrophysicists all can give you a thousand reasons why you should go back to the moon because of what professor yuri said
it is the rosetta stone of the universe
there is more to be known from the moon about the earth than you can ever get out of the earth
it is still very useful to go back there from a scientific point of view
plus the engineering and economics of it
i didn't say it because i wasn't sure you wanted to have such a discussion
but i will
i think it is a travesty that we aren't doing it with the space shuttle and the space station to go back to the moon or to go to mars
why do i think that
because in either case i don't understand why you would want to build an earth entering vehicle to go to the moon
what you want is an interplanetary spacecraft
why does it have to have a heat shield
why does it have to have parachutes or some kind of landing capability
why not just go to and from earth orbit
and the space shuttle is the greatest machine for carrying things too and from orbit that has ever been thought of
and the one they are going to build even if it's an unmanned vehicle is still going to have an awful lot of complexity to it
and i think that if you've made the space shuttle economically viable which nobody thinks you can
and maybe chris kraft is the only one that thinks you can
if that is true then that is true
i don't think that way
i think the space shuttle is an economically viable machine and so it is a travesty to me to throw it away
and the space station could be used as the place where you assemble all this stuff
and everybody says well it's at the wrong inclination
yes it is at the wrong inclination
you were foolish to put it there in the first place but that is where it is
every time i had a little bit of fuel left over i'd inch it down a little bit and the first thing you know we'd be down to twenty eight point five degrees
today it costs you fifteen thousand pounds of payload to go to the space station and that is a travesty too
you wouldn't want to do that continuously
i would use the space station as my assembly point and i would use the space shuttle as the machine to go there
and then i would build myself a bunch of interplanetary spacecraft to go to and from the moon and mars
and when i did that i would be smart enough to build all these newfangled structures inflatable structures et cetera which you could use not only as the interplanetary spacecraft
you would use that where you would live on the moon
i think it has a better approach from an engineering point of view
whether that is the political way to sell the program mister griffin has got to do that
i mean that is what his job is
fortunately it is not mine
i was asked to be the deputy administrator and the administrator of nasa several times
and you can hear the way i talk here that i would have lasted about six days to six months
what do i think about the possibilities of today's plans
i hate to say this but i think it is going to fail
i don't think it will work
i don't think that the program as stipulated today is the way to do it
and i don't think that political climate is such that the budgetary support will be provided
and i hope i am wrong
i don't think i am
do you think the chinese will be there
beg your pardon
does that mean the chinese will be there
no
hell the chinese are fifty years from going to the moon
they cannot buy it from russia
that is what they're doing today
they're buying all their technology to put man in space from russia
you know that makes me think the russians are still using the same spacecraft with slight variation that they put gagarin up in one thousand nine hundred sixty one
literally it's pretty close to it
i've sat in it
have you sat in it fred
you sit in it like this
but they used it over and over and over and over again
the b fifty two has been used over and over again
it has a new wing
it has new electronics
it had new bombs
it has new everything on it
the only thing that is the same is the configuration
it had new engines probably five times in its lifetime
that is what we ought to be doing with the shuttle isn't it
we seem to have this great propensity in this country for building something wonderful and great and high performance and then throwing it away
we put up the skylab
wonderful
throw it away and don't build anymore
build the saturn five
gee whiz it will put two hundred thousand pounds to the moon
it is rotting away at johnson space center
the trekkies in the country got so mad at the johnson space center that they made them build a hanger to put it in so it wouldn't rot anymore
we built a space station and we're throwing it away
we built a space shuttle and we're throwing it away
golly my mother would have gone bananas
we had leftovers almost every other meal
i know that's trite but don't you think that is foolishness to do things that way
i think it is
we did learn from space flight that everybody seemed to learn from everybody else's experiences
that was an amazing factor to me in the early days particularly
the astronauts each one that flew was so much better than the one before
and knew how to do the job better than the one before
all of those things you could see yourself advancing and they just built on this experience of each man
and i don't know how they transmitted that to each other
they didn't obviously because they didn't have a brain connection
but that is the way we ought to be doing it here
we've got all these things that we build and then throw away and don't take advantage of
that doesn't make a lot of sense to me
now i know there are politics involved
and that is a reason i said you had to take into account the politics
when can you get the money
how do you convince people that you need to do things
what does it do to the job situation
how does it affect each senator's and each congressman's state in terms of the money that you bring into that area et cetera
when we built the space shuttle we had a contract in every state in the union except alaska
and we did that on purpose
aaron and i flew to every one of those seventy five major subcontractors in the shuttle
they were all over the country and we would go visit them at least three or four times n a period of a couple of years
the politics has to be there
we were lucky in apollo
i call it the conjunction of the stars and the conjunction of the politics
that is a story i meant to tell
by one thousand nine hundred seventy eight seventy seven maybe we were really behind a power curve on the budget for the shuttle
we had been pushing a wave of about ten percents less funds than we needed each year
at about that time period we needed if we were going to have any semblance of making a one thousand nine hundred eighty or eighty one first flight we needed a dollars six hundred million supplement and about that much per year more than we were getting
and nasa had this big meeting down at the johnson space center
and we all talked about what the problems were and how we were going to meet that
and everybody absolutely all the politics said you cannot go ask for a supplement you cannot go ask the congress for any more you cannot go to the white house and say we need more money
so we may just have to turn this thing into an x fifteen project a research project
the first shuttle flight will be whenever we can build it and it will just be a test vehicle
we were all very downhearted about that
doctor frost who was then the administrator went up to the white house about three days later
and carter who was the president called him in and said i want to tell you how wonderful that space shuttle is
and frost said he could feel himself tighten up
and he said you know i just had this meeting with the russians at the salt talks whatever salt meant
and i was pointing out to them that we were building this marvelous new space machine and we were going to be able to do all kinds of things with it
we were going to be able to fly over russia and look at the world
and he said it carried the day
and frost said oh my god what is nasa going to do about that
he came back thought about it for a few days and went back to see the president
he said mister president i have to tell you this shuttle is in trouble
we don't have the money
we're not going to make the launch dates
it is questionable whether we can even build the machine at this point in time because we haven't built the thermal protection system
we didn't even have the factory built yet to build the tiles in
mister carter said how much do you need
and he said well i think we need about dollars six hundred million this year and i think we will need about dollars four hundred million a year
that was a wag on doctor frost's part
and the president said you will get it
that was how close we were to the shuttle failing from a political point of view
i don't know what the politics of tomorrow is that might change our mind
it would be wonderful if the chinese would land on the moon tomorrow because that might get the congress back in action
but can you see the congress in the face of what has happened with katrina and rita and a few other things that happened in the united states and the iraqi war and the budgetary problems they face i cannot see them giving nasa the money they would need to do the program
and nasa says they can go back to the moon between now and two thousand eighteen for dollars one hundred six billion
mister webb doubled the price
all us great cost estimators we estimated the cost of the shuttle and jim webb got it and multiplied it by two
today i would say you would have to multiply that by ten if you think you're going back to the moon
i cannot imagine
aaron and i worked on a program in one thousand nine hundred ninety eight
when did we do the mars study
in eighty nine
we estimated the cost in one thousand nine hundred eighty nine dollars to go to mars at dollars four hundred billion and i think we were low
i keep have to catch myself
i know it's the politics that you have to be concerned about
if you told them that it was going to cost dollars four hundred billion dollars then for sure it would be cancelled right
you've got to tell them something that is rational but i don't think they will get supported even with the amount of money they say it is going to cost
i hope i am a pessimist
yes sir
i have two separate questions
one is the improvements you said that were made in computing capability from mercury through the shuttle i was wondering if there was any thought into making the computer systems on the shuttle more upgradable
and if there was would there have been any value in using modern systems
and then the second question is related to the comment you made about if the shuttle was designed to fly automatically after the challenger accident they could have just flown again the next day
i wasn't really sure what you meant by that so if you could elaborate on it a bit
let me go to your first question
it isn't the hardware
it is the software
and it is the software checkout and it is the software validation that you have to worry about on the orbiter
when you have four systems that are operating on a forty millisecond time cycle and checking with each other at the end of that cycle that they are all in lock step john is looking at me saying my god how did we ever do that
and i don't know how we ever did it but we did it
it is the software and not the hardware
when you have an updatable computer which you should have and will have it is the software that is the problem not the hardware
that has always been the case
trying to make the software fit into the new computer the way the hooks are in system is just totally different
and therefore the guaranty that the system doesn't have a bunch of glitches in it that are going to get to you you know when we flew to the moon on apollo eleven we had a book about that thick with computer anomalies in it
we understood them all but that is how many software fixes we needed to make
we just didn't make them because we didn't want to nor had the time to do them
what i meant by flying an unmanned shuttle was that you couldn't convince the politicians or the powers that be whoever they are that you could fly the shuttle the next day manned
but if you didn't have a man in it who would have cared
and so you could have flown it the next day and it would have worked perfectly because it was warmer at the cape
do you know what the condition on the pad was the morning they launched challenger
there were icicles hanging off the gantry that long and that big around at cape canaveral
let me tell you something
you know why they got there
they did what we did in one thousand nine hundred twenty
they turned the water on and let it run all night because they were afraid that the fire suppression system on the pad was going to freeze and not be able to be turned on when they launched so they let it drip all night
and i am sitting there saying that solid rocket has not been qualified for temperatures below forty seven degrees fahrenheit
and they're convincing themselves that the core temperature of the solids is much higher than that because it has been sitting in the sun for the last two months and the temperature is so and so but they didn't think about the seals
if you remember that professor sticking the seal in the ice
well that's what i meant
the next day the temperature would have been warmer put new rockets on it
max faget said the next day why don't you just put a heater around the joint and put a belly band over the top of it and fly
damn good idea
yes sir
you mentioned that one of the reasons the shuttle is so expensive is because you have so many redundant systems onboard
now what would be your solution
not to have them onboard or just not to have them all upgrading at launch
no you got the wrong implication there
it is expensive because they insist on having them operating at the time of launch
it is not the redundancy that makes it more expensive
it is the checkout and the testing and proof that it's there and the replacement of the systems and the use of the systems that makes it more expensive
but what makes the shuttle so expensive are the numbers of people involved in preparing it
there are roughly ten thousand people involved in that operation who make x number of dollars per hour or day
and it costs in today's money about dollars five billion a year to fly the shuttle seven times
it probably cost dollars five billion a year to fly it thirty times
not much difference
maybe dollars five point five billion
so it is the people
you've got to get rid of the people
and people have been trying to do that ever since mercury get rid of the amount of people
and they try and they put in the automaticity and the automatic checkout and then don't use it
check it out
and as i said they put more hours on it in the hanger than they do in space
it wears out the system checking it
and it takes people to do that so it's people
so what's your solution to that
i think you have to have some hardnosed sob that says i'm going to get rid of the people and you do it with automaticity automatic checkout automatic everything
in today's world why would you do it any other way
i will give you another example
when we built the caution and warning system on the space shuttle the safety and reliability people said it has to be hardwired
can you imagine that
why wouldn't you use bits instead of hardwire
oh but it's a lot safer and a lot more reliable
i will use my same word hogwash
it is a lot safer and more reliable with bits
but that's the system
you've got to change it
and two of us have tried
you can see us flying down in flames almost everywhere
yes sir
for the young engineer a lot of us hear about the apollo mission and talk about the good old days where we wish we were in the days of engineering by the seat of your pants
is that type of job and that type of excitement of engineering possible in nasa's environment today or should we look elsewhere like towards private enterprises
could we find the type of job we hear about in nasa these days
i have to be careful how i answer that
i want you in nasa
it is important that you guys be in nasa
or at least in the space program working in the industry
because you are tomorrow's opportunity
just because you hear chris kraft say things that doesn't mean a damn thing tomorrow
you have to do it yourself
and you have to want to do it yourself
and you have to bring the ideas to the program
and you have to be willing to do that
and this willingness to take on the things that must be taken on in order to get the job done
your question about seat of the pants et cetera sure we did a lot of things when we first started by seat of the pants because we didn't know any other way to do it
we did it by feel
we did it by past experience
a lot of us had been in an airplane flight test world
so we did it by having seen the past doing things the right way
that was our seat of the pants
our seat of the pants wasn't just a scarf around our neck so to speak
it was an educated seat of the pants
and that is what you have to provide
in the end it will take a lot of the seat of the pants
i think the way i know aaron and i have done it was to believe in the people you had
you have to learn how to find out who the guys are that know what they're talking about and trust them
you have to put them in the job give them the responsibility and authority to do it and then trust them
and you have to build them
the biggest problem that you have today that nasa has today and the aerospace industry has today the biggest problem i cannot say that too strongly is that they have not built anything in twenty five years
and so they've forgotten what it takes to do it
you don't know how to do it
but if i put you on the job and gave you the authority to do it you could do it in three or four years
you need my help and guys like me to tell you where the bumps in the road are
but you're going to do it a hell of a lot better than i did given the opportunity to do it
did that answer your question
i think it is
you might have to help it
you have to vote
in the sixty s i was hoping that all these space cadets all these trekkies all those guys would now be in the congress and that they would vote for the space program
boy was i ever dead wrong
there aren't enough grateful dead fans around
yes sir
do you think the success of the apollo project was in some way linked to the ferment that was taking place in the sixty s
oh absolutely
i think that we had an enthusiasm at the time that is probably unparalleled in engineering circles
now we had the manhattan project to build a nuclear bomb
draper had the project to build a polaris submarine but it was clustered
what is that word
and it wasn't seen as we brought it to the fore
it wasn't a national program
it wasn't a national priority
it wasn't national pride
nobody knew about it
everybody knew about apollo
i was damn proud to walk into any room where i ever went to say i worked on apollo
that reminds me of a horrible cartoon to make my point
i was in austin texas following the challenger accident
and here i am one of the proudest people to ever be in nasa
the cartoon in the paper when i got up that morning was the following
it showed these kids playing with a frisbee
the first one throws it over here to this guy
the second one throws it back
the third one the damn thing explodes in his face
the fourth was says his father works for nasa
boy that brings it home to you pretty damn fast doesn't it
nobody in one thousand nine hundred sixty seven sixty eight sixty nine would have dared put that cartoon in the paper
by having new people in a space program there is always this lack of experience which you have to train just to have
how do you transmit that experience to the new people
you intermingle the young with the old
you bring the elderly engineers into the system and make you responsible for designing the system but have me in your hip pocket
after six months two years you won't need me in your hip pocket anymore because you would have learned all those things and learned them better and done them better
you have to mix them
the ingredients for the pie and the cake have to be there
and that is part of the ingredient
and why hasn't that taken place
because of two reasons
nasa hasn't done anything in terms of building new hardware other than the space station which really wasn't testing the state of the art
it was a great program but didn't test the state of the art
the industry has been doing the same thing
the industry has been building airplanes but they haven't been building any spaceships so they've lost that capability also
that's the travesty too
you've got to rebuild them both at the same time
but it only happens by experience
i cannot take what professor cohen knows and what i know and put it in your head
you have to fail a few times
it is only by the failures that you're going to learn
i once heard a sermon that said when you're a young christian or hebrew walking down the aisle all your doors are open
i am walking down the aisle and i'm pretty close to the end and all the ones behind me are shut
you're willing to go in all those doors
i am frightened to death to go in those damn doors
we need you and you need me but you don't need me very long until you get up to speed
don't be frightened of it
go do it
and don't be afraid to fail
you learn much more from our failures than you ever learn from our successes
back there
given all these problems with nasa that we've seen just growing over the years what do you think about the commercial efforts to access space
not necessarily what is going on now but also in the future
if we had that ability to sort of bypass nasa's framework with all the bureaucracy issues is that a possibly way for us to continue
well i think it is very possible but the problem is investment
the investment specialists say if you cannot give me a return on investment in three years maximum five years i won't invest in it
and the aerospace industry is worse than that
they don't have any money
they aren't willing to make an investment in the future
the investors who have the money want a return
the guys that have the capability to do it don't have the money to invest
until it gets to the point where it is a little more realistic from the return on investment it is not going to get to the point where commercial ventures are willing to do it
because it is just too expensive
and probably if failure is so high in our business that investors shy away from it
i think it will come to that but i don't think it is going to come very rapidly as it did for instance in the airplane business
i mean even today we wouldn't be flying the transports we have or the supersonic airplanes that we have without government having made that investment at the time
the seven hundred seven the first big really good jet transport was totally dependent upon the b forty seven airplane which is built by the same people right
and so it was a government investment
i said well we did it in an airplane business to a certain extent but nowhere near as much as people think
all of the technology was done by the government investment in the airplane
and the next step the supersonic transport which we ought to have
that is another travesty that we don't have a supersonic transport
that hasn't been done by boeing or lockheed because they won't invest that kind of money on their own
they take the investment of the government in supersonic aerodynamics and engines and structure and use it in a supersonic airplane
i think it is a ways off
a lot of people have tried it the most notable being kistler recently and have failed
i think it can be done and done better
you can do it better outside of the government because you don't have all those regulations to contend with and all the gaos on top of you
it is just going to take a while
i hesitate to say this but i will
programs like spaceshipone that is trickery that is child's play what he is doing
wait until he tries to go to orbit
that is his next step
tell me when that is going to happen
he is kidding the world at the moment
chris kraft says that
i want you to remember that because i could be dead wrong but that is my opinion
just child's play
we did the x one in one thousand nine hundred forty six
and we didn't have any buckling in the structure either which he had
where do you think that buckling came from
what do you think happened there
where did it come from
but if his plane renews interest in space i mean if it inspires a ten year old to end up working for nasa fifteen years from now isn't that a good thing
that is great
absolutely
but don't kid yourself that the next step is flying a machine to orbit
i am at fault for being so negative about it because you're right i think it does inspire the young to do it
as much as i hate to cut us off it is eleven point zero
class is over
students again remember to pick up your papers
chris that has been just an extraordinary opportunity and an experience for all of us
and once more we are very appreciative
we know you don't give very many public lectures these days and that you chose to come here and talk to everybody at mit we truly appreciate it and we would like to thank you again
it was quite an experience for all of us to get to hear him
and it is equally very fortunate now to have wayne hale who has had a very illustrious career at nasa
wayne came to nasa the same year i did in one thousand nine hundred seventy eight worked his way up as an engineer through the propulsion system the integrated communication systems
became a flight director in one thousand nine hundred eighty eight and served there for fifteen years
he was flight director both for the orbit phase and then the most really kind of intense flight control phase as ascent and entry
and wayne was ascent and entry flight director and then lead flight director for many flights including we were trying to figure out before
but i think he actually served for all of my last four flights
so we've known each other for a long time
in two thousand three he was sent to the kennedy space center to be head of launch operations
but he didn't get to spend very much time in the florida sunshine because they asked him to come back to houston the next year as deputy program manager for the space shuttle
and then when bill gerstenmeyer left to move up to nasa headquarters wayne became the program manager
so he is able to talk to us both about mission control operations and the current and future state of affairs of the shuttle
and he is very happy to have you ask questions while he is talking
and i am not going to talk anymore because they came to hear you wayne
thank you jeff
i cannot tell you how much i've been looking forward to coming here to talk to you folks
this is my favorite subject
space number one
the shuttle number two
and mission control number three
maybe not exactly in that order but they are all three topics that have been
oh that was you
i thought that was me
i thought that's a sound i haven't heard before and i'm in big trouble
ok
but as jeff said please feel free to ask any questions
i will tell you all kinds of interesting stories today i think
some of them might even be about doctor hoffman
i should tell you my background as an engineer
i got my bachelor's and master's degree in mechanical engineering
did not decide to pursue a doctorate degree for a variety of reasons
you need to understand that the organization of nasa is very much around the centers
it was organized as a group largely of independent centers with a very thin veneer of integration at nasa headquarters
and it remains that way to this day
and every center is quite different from every other center
we have some centers that are largely involved in research
and if you want to work in the research center langley glenn ames then you need to clearly pursue a phd
if you're more interested in an ops center kennedy marshall johnson then you need to kind of not go after the phd
because people with phds clearly do not have a real world practical understanding of problems
and it is only the guys with bachelor's degrees that get out and know how to turn wrenches in their spare time required there
so it is very interesting the different cultures
i can say that with a grin because there are different cultures within nasa
and working between the centers is very interesting
and since i have moved in the management ranks for what reason i don't understand i have fouled up in my career
make you a manager when you don't get to do the things that you're good at anymore
yes promote you something that you were never trained for
it has been very interesting for me to try to work between the various centers to help them accomplish the goals that the agency has
one of the things i should say is that i regret my academic career as i didn't take more psychology more accounting
because frankly when i was in graduate school i can remember one of the courses i had was systems of nonlinear partial differential equations
anybody taken a class that has a title vaguely similar to that
i never used that class
i have never touched a differential equation in my professional career
now why that is is kind of interesting
but what i really did need was trigonometry and accounting
and you will see a little bit of that
today my class is not going to be highly technical
it is going to be a series of illustrations about mission control
and as i said i will be happy to talk to you about it
i go to a lot of conferences these days and i frequently sit in advanced space systems sessions
i sat in a very interesting future reusable launch vehicle session the last aiaa conference i went to
and i walked away totally distressed because they have no concept of what the real world is like in many of these academic seminars
and i want to inject a little bit of real world realism into what you guys think about as engineers
one of the favorite topics of people these days that are designing advanced space systems include what they call and austere launch pad
in other words you cannot fix anything on the rocket when it is on the launch pad
and the reason they side is look how much money all these programs spend fixing their rocket out on the launch pad
well the fact of the matter is rockets are very finicky rockets have very little margin in many of their components and things break
they can break and you don't even know it until you plug them all together and turn them on
and if you have a launch pad that is austere and you can do no work on it well what was one of those colorful phrases that chris kraft would use
you have really bought the farm
i won't use his colorful phrases
you wind up spending a lot more money because you've got to take the rocket back to the barn and take it all apart rather than maybe get access to fix it
if there was anything that i wish we had was more capability to fix things on the launch pad
we spend a lot of time and money working around problems that we cannot fix at the launch pad even though we have a huge amount of capability
you don't save money there
it is a false economy
similarly there is a notion en vogue that you don't need a big mission control
that is just a lot of people that cost a lot of money that you don't really need
i think it reached the height of the anti mission control forces during the dcx program when they were very proud to proclaim their mission control was a trailer house with three people in it
and they thought that was all any space vehicle needed to have to launch
of course they only reached an altitude to five thousand feet and they crashed their only prototype vehicle not because of mission control but perhaps because they didn't pay enough attention to operational situations
in my business now i can tell you that in the space shuttle program mission control cost me less than two percents of the total budget for the space shuttle program
what we get for that two percents is quite amazing
and every time the budget folks come down from washington to review our budget they want to help us drive down the ops cost they take one look you have the budget breakdown of the shuttle program and they say you guys don't spend very much on ops
this is not where we need to look if we want to save some money
if you want to save some money you need to make a reusable vehicle
reusable and not so maintenance intensive to turn it around
and that may be a theme that you hear today
i've got a couple of things i want to pass out to get started a couple of glossy brochures
i think there are enough of these for everyone about mission control
people in the class should get first dibs at this but hopefully there are enough to go around
i think there are plenty of these
and the little one is similar to the big one
and i'm not going to spend a lot of time
if you want to know about how mission control room is laid out and who the people are that do things it's all in this brochure
i don't intend to go over that
i think chris kraft probably gave you a good background about why do we have a mission control
why did he invent a mission control
and this is kind of the nuts and bolts of mission control as it exists today
public affairs office is really good about putting those things together and i don't intend to cover them
also because i had a whole bunch of copies of my last two papers sitting around that i needed to get rid of i lugged them up here
i want to give you copies of my last two papers which have to do with operational issues that you can read at your leisure
and i particularly want you to look at the considerations in rendezvous launch windows
those are two different papers
one discussing entry operational considerations and hypersonic entry that we've learned with the space shuttle
the other about rendezvous launch windows
and it will give you a little flavor for what a real operation needs
many people can talk to you about the physics kind of the things that god says you must do if you are going to rendezvous in space for example
but there are many other considerations that you run into in the real world
so i am going to talk today mostly about mission control
perhaps at the end we can talk a little bit about the shuttle program
and these i am short of so please people in the class only as my handout for the slides here today
and the slides will be posted on the web as well
yes
doctor hoffman has got them off my electronics here
ok so the things i am going to talk about today basically are outlines on this page
we have a mission control
here are some of the reasons we are going to talk about trajectory
planning and monitoring flight planning
systems engineering
and then i've got a couple of stories from the trenches
and then i promise you no differential equations today
question
why should you have a mission control
why is it necessary to have a mission control
i have four basic reasons to have a mission control
the first one is safety
we have seven or eight astronauts flying arguably the most complex flight vehicle that has ever been invented
they don't have enough time or enough resources to watch everything to the degree that is necessary
we have a large group of folks on the ground in mission control about eight hundred folks in mission control that are also monitoring at a very detailed level with more information than the astronauts get to make sure that everything is operating as it should be
we provide a level of safety in mission control
secondly we provide flexibility
we start planning a space shuttle mission typically about eighteen months in advance
the flight operations people are the flight planning people so the space shuttle program
nasa headquarters will come down and say you need to fly a space shuttle flight that does x services the hubble space telescope deploys the chandra x ray telescope goes to the international space station and adds a module or carries supplies or what have you
then it is up to the planners who will become the operators to put that plan together
how are we going to accomplish the big objectives on this flight
it's not just enough to take this big module up and plug it into the space station
you've got to wire it up
you've got know when to do which wire first and what switch to throw in what order or you will fry the circuits
it's a very complicated business
it is really complicated when you have to deal with scientists
so when we fly scientific payloads we deal with folks that are not operationally minded
they may have been working on their experiment for oh how long did it take to get a doctorate degree fifteen point twenty years in some cases
they have been working on this experiment for many years
they are going to get the maximum amount of data they can but they are not aware of the fact that there are four other payloads onboard and four other competing folks that want to get their science data in
we always have a discussion about how many person hours of astronaut time can we devote to an experiment
how many kilowatt hours of power can we devote to an experiment
on and on and on
and it makes these researchers do some really tough sole searching
and the saddest thing that i have ever seen is an experiment and there has been more than one of them where they flipped the switch it blew the fuse it was down for the count and lost all objectives with the first switch throw
and then the scientists would come running and in and say if you'll just let the astronauts take the back panel off and rewire this circuit it will work
and we don't have time to do that on a spaceflight
or if we did have time to do it we would take that time away from experimenter number two or experimenter number three or all of the above
in operations there is a lot of work to set priorities set timelines make sure you do things in the right order and then train the operators and the crew
now once you do that planning for eighteen months you understand the priorities the pros and cons the logic behind all of those trades
and so when you go into flight and something happens as it always does we can re plan it on the fly
and we do almost every flight or the vast majority of flights take the flight plan that we published pre flight put it gently in the recycle bin and develop a new flight plan that can be drastically different
and we're able to achieve a great degree of success in our operation of the objectives that we set out to do because we have the people that can in real time while we're flying the flight in this short period of less than two weeks overnight re plan and come back with a new plan to accomplish the objectives
yes sir
wayne i was one of those scientists who didn't understand about the realities of spaceflight
and i liked your choice of the words you would discuss with us
dictate would be the key word
indeed
the question i wanted to address to you is this business of taking the flight pad putting it in the wastebasket and then generating a new one
in the seven shuttle flights that i would have investigator status on they all had as their basic philosophy a return to baseline
if something went wrong get back to your baseline plan as quickly as you could even if you knew that it was non optimal
could you comment on that
i would say from my perspective quite the opposite
yes there is a baseline plan
and there were very good reasons for that baseline plan
but the flight control team is always looking for the optimum solution
so i would say my perspective may be a little bit different from yours but that has been my experience
we are always trying to achieve the maximum number of objectives
so flexibility from mission control is the second big advantage
the third big advantage is let the crew focus on those things that people can only do in space
they have access to vacuum
they've got zero gravity
they've got the high vantage point to do earth observations what have you
you cannot do those things on earth
that is why we put people in space
and why would we make them calculate the gas budget for deorbit burn which can be done by some bachelor of science engineer with an accounting minor on the ground
so we let the crews focus on those things that you can only do in space and we do every job that we can on the ground
somebody calculated for me one time and i almost hate to give the statistic that it is dollars thirty point zero a minute for people in space
you can hire a lot of engineers to offload that amount of time
and finally there are some jobs that you can only do on the ground
the noaa weather satellites do not directly uplink to the shuttle so the astronauts don't know anything about weather other than the little part of the world they can see out their window
if you want to forecast where you land that's a job that you can only do on the ground
obviously radar tracking there are hundreds of things that you can only do on the ground
and i would say interact with management and review the priorities is one of those things that can only be done on the ground
here is my first cartoon for the day that compares airline travel to space travel
and i think this is a telling cartoon because it is entirely true
i flew in last night on probably a twelve or fifteen year old seven hundred thirty seven
it was a nice plane but a little shabby
and we got bumped around pretty good coming into boston
and i am thinking all the time about i wonder if they have maintained this aircraft well
you can pick up the papers
and they do a very good job in the airlines but the fact of the matter is much of the airline industry is involved with passengers and customer relations and baggage handling and all those good things
and the maintainers and the safety people are few by comparison
in comparison with the shuttle we don't have very many passengers to deal with
generally they are cooperative
sometimes they get surly
but we don't have very many to deal with
and everybody in the program is a safety worker
and that is something we continuously exercise
to turn a space shuttle orbiter around from one flight to the next takes five hundred thousand man hours of maintenance
there is a gem for you
people have been working for thirty years to decrease the amount of time that it takes to turn the space shuttle orbiter around
it is a reusable vehicle but it is a reusable vehicle built with very small margins with a lot of complicated technology
and it takes a lot of maintenance
some people think we would have been better launching expendable rockets
the same amount of time actually a little more is involved in launching titan ivs which have the same payload throw weight as the orbiter does to low earth orbit
the new launch vehicles atlas v delta iv and its variance are supposed to be launched with a whole lot less
however they do not have the payload capacity to orbit
and in fact they have not achieved their goals of man hours to a launch that they have set out to yet
although they are early yet
we've got to give them time to work on it
but the fact of the matter getting into space whether you doing with an ariane a soyuz an h two or an atlas v delta iv or the space shuttle remains a very expensive process which i think the public doesn't quite understand
i would like to talk about some of the things that mission control does to get ready for a flight and then how they execute it in flight
and first among those is trajectory control
who in here is an orbital mechanics wizard
good
ok
we will have some equations for you in just a minute
here is the first one
would you like to step up and explain
ok
this is all involved in orbital mechanics
this is how do you get to orbit
we have the flight performance reserve of main propulsion system propellant
we load a half a million gallons of propellant
that is over two point five million pounds of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen in the external tank for the shuttle
how much do we have for a normally planned mission at the end of when you achieve orbital insertion
anybody want to guess
remember every pound of propellant that you leave in the tank and throw away into the ocean is a pound of payload that you could have carried to orbit
so this is not a trivial process
our goal is about nine hundred pounds
and you are going to see how we do
but this is a little plot that we've developed based on mixture ratio of the engines
now the space shuttle main engines have what we call an overboard mixture ratio of six point thirty nine nominally
we test fire them at the stennis space center every engine for every flight to check how they operate mixture ratio because mixture ratio and isp are critical
when we updated the space shuttle main engines to the block two engines they are vastly safer than the original engines in the shuttle because they operate at lower pressures lower temperatures and their rotating turbo machinery operates considerably slower rpm
however we gave us a second and a half of isp
and that is huge in this business a second and a half of isp
this plot shows as a function of mixture ratio if you have any shift in mixture ratio in flight which we have i'm going to talk a little bit about that you will change the amount of residual remaining
here the little blue dots are the normal flight performance reserve
that is how much gas you've got left in the tank when you get to orbit
and you can see our goal here is about two thousand five hundred pounds
of that about nine hundred pounds is fuel residual based on this curve right here
now you may ask why do you want to have an extra amount of hydrogen fuel in the tank over oxygen what is the difference
the engines are designed the cutoff hydrogen rich
we don't operate at the stoichiometric chemical ratio that you would combine hydrogen and oxygen to make water
we operated at about a mixture ratio of six instead of a mixture ratio that would be eighteen
i think
did i do my chemistry right
it's been a while
we operate considerably off the stoichiometric ratio
as you get mixture ratios that approach the stoichiometric mixture ratio your fire burns a lot hotter
you get a lot more heat out of that fire
metallurgically the engines cannot stand those higher temperatures
we already operate at six thousand degrees fahrenheit
that is tough
you run out of fuel and cut off oxygen rich those temperatures will go out of site in the engine turbo pumps
so we want to cut off fuel rich
we biased ourselves so we cut off fuel rich but it does not take very much of a mixture ratio shift to get you to cut of lox rich
in fact as mixture ratio crosses the knee of this curve you wind up leaving actually a lot of lox in the system cutting off on the fuel side
so we have to carefully monitor how the engines come in
and when we talk about overboard mixture ratio that is not just what the engines operate at but it's whatever losses you have in the system
as you bleed hot hydrogen or hot oxygen off the engines to repressurize the tank that becomes a loss and that affects mixture ratio
one of the real problems we're dealing with is as we develop what we call engine tags down at the stennis space center we have found an interesting phenomenon
in flight we pressurize the tanks with their native constituent the oxygen tanks pressurized with oxygen and the hydrogen tanks pressurized with hydrogen
at stennis where we do the engine tests and develop the characteristics of each engine
and every engine is just a little bit different they pressurize their tanks with nitrogen for safety reasons
the nitrogen can diffuse into your hydrogen but more importantly it can diffuse into your oxygen system
and therefore you have a less pure propellant and it drives our mixture ratio off as a function of having impurities in the propellant
so we get a tag of what we think the mixture ratio is of the engine
that is different than what we get when we go fly
and in fact the last flights one of the last meetings i had before i came down here yesterday was a meeting with our flight analyst who have an unexplained missing three hundred pounds of hydrogen every flight for the last ten or twelve flights
and we are beginning to converge on the idea that it is this nitrogen impurity in stennis that gives us a false mixture ratio which we design our flights around
let's talk a little bit about it
here is a little schematic
the external tanks really have two tanks the oxygen tank on top and the hydrogen tank on bottom
when we make it to orbit how much is remaining in each tank
well the answer to that question is none
what we are running on at orbit insertion is what is left in the pipe
and it is really not orbit insertion but close enough to talk about it
so we have seventeen inch diameter pipe coming down the side of the hydrogen tank from the oxygen tank up above
it goes across into the engine compartment of the orbiter
and this shows you where several of the early flights were at main engine cutoff guided cutoff where we wanted to be from an orbital mechanics standpoint altitude velocity flight path angle and so forth
that is where we were
that is how much was remaining in the tank
none in the tank
that is how much is remaining in the line
that is how close you have to cut it for spaceflight
i have another presentation and if we have time i might show you a few charts out of that that talks about the difference between commercial aviation and spaceflight
we operate on much smaller margins
and every pound you see in that far part of the table that talks about the residual remaining those number of pounds and by the way we're antiques
we use english tradition units in the space shuttle program
but every pound residual that you have in that far column is a pound that you could have taken to orbit of payload but did not
you threw that away
yes
how do you measure that mass
very good question
they look at pressure hit
we have pressure transducers down in the lines as they approach the engine and you're accelerating at three g
we have an inertial measurement unit that measures velocity and we control the engine throttle setting to three gs as we approach meco
and so you look at the pressure and that determines based on a very simple head calculation where you are in that standby coming down the outside
the fuel side is a little bit more complicated
they have a five percents level sensor in the tank that tells you when you're at five percents in the tank
and then we have fuel flow meters on the hydrogen side and they calculate flow rate minus from the five percents level down to when a main engine is cut off
so those are the ways we can do residual
and that is not a simple exercise
it is vastly more complicated than the simple explanation i just gave you because the engines are throttling continuously
now i wanted to talk a little bit if i can move from normal mission planning to abort mission planning
normal mission planning is something we do upfront and then we monitor during flight
and one of the stories at the very end of this presentation is about a day when things did not go right in the engine world and what we did about it
this is going to talk about abort modes
now the shuttle is very interesting
human spaceflight is different than expendable spaceflight because we would really like to get the people back
and expendable spaceflight your basic principle is if one of the rocket engines quits early you are done
the payload goes in the water
or if you launch from it may go into mongolia
but you don't get it back
there are no overs with very few exceptions
if you have a problem in your main propulsion system on an expendable rocket it is time to talk to your insurance company because you are done
even very minor problems can strand satellites in lower orbits than they have useful life
it is very important that the propulsion system work well
but the shuttle was designed with the thought that one of the three main engines could shut down early
we have safety monitoring on those engines to make sure that they would shut down if something goes wrong in a contained that is to say they don't blow up manner
and then you have to have the capability to get the crew back much like an airliner
if you fly on an airliner or any kind of multi engine aircraft one of the things that they must be certified for is engine out operations
lose an engine pass the commitment point on takeoff and still be able to takeoff safely and return to the airport
that is a fundamental principle in aviation safety for a multi engine aircraft
one of the shuttle design goals is very similar
lose one of the rocket engines have it shut down prematurely and still be able to land safely somewhere
notice i said one engine
not two engines
not three engines
one engine
that is a huge technological leap over expendable rockets
a huge technological leap
and we pay the price in terms of performance
here is a little bit of the different abort modes
if you have an engine out somewhere between launch and about four minutes into flight
you have to return to the launch site which involves turning around and flying backwards at mach six through your own rocket plume which is everybody's favorite thing to want to avoid doing
a little bit later than that we pick up the capability to do transatlantic abort
sometimes we call the transoceanic aborts but the acronym really is transatlantic abort
tal
and land somewhere in europe or africa
and somewhat further along you can abort to orbit
you can actually dump your secondary propellant and wind up in a lower orbit
and then you may orbit once around or you may come back on the third orbit
or you may be able in fact to fly nearly a normal mission depending on how lucky you got for the time that the engine was out and how you were doing with reserves
here is a little bit of different graphic a cartoon of the same thing
i don't like it too much because rtls actually turns the other way
but as you can see we would try to return to the kennedy space center which has possibly the worst weather in the entire western hemisphere or continue on around or up on end to orbit
and you have to always be concerned about external tank disposal
this was the abort regions chart generated pre flight for our last flight sts one hundred fourteen
we have three tal sites transatlantic intact tal sites one at the zaragoza air base in north spain one at moron air base in south spain near seville and one at le tube which is the french air force flight test facility near marseilles
and then we have what we call press to ato
press to abort which involves a dump involves changing your inclination of your orbit to a lower inclination if you invoke this
you cannot for example ever rendezvous with the space station because you won't wind up in the right orbital inclination even though you may make the altitude
and then we have what we call press to meco which involves just kind of closing your eyes and riding it out and see what happens as you get close to your guided meco
so we build these charts in advance
and then we have a very sophisticated computer program in mission control that monitors the engines the entire time during launch called the abort region determinator that can emulate a single engine out two engines out three engines out or a vacuum impact point
and a flight dynamics officer is responsible for making those calls
the crew does not make these calls
the crew has a crew card very similar to this onboard so that if they lose communication with the ground and something bad happens they might have a chance at pulling it off
but it is based on everything more or less performing as planned
if anything is performing off normal than these charts are no good
that is hosted in mission control
and until some day we put a supercomputer onboard the space vehicle it will continue to be hosted in mission control
do you have a question
yes
that is a critical real time call that is made in a hurry
it is not always decision aid
can you comment a little bit on the reliance upon the automatic decision aid computer that is grinding this out and the judgment of flight control
well first of all you have made a false distinction because the people that wrote the computer code are the flight controllers
they understand the logic that went into it with practice probably three days a week in mission control exercising simulated missions that have engine problems so you practice that
it's not an either or
it's a symbiotic relationship
the abort region determinator doesn't work without operators
operators only have the cue cards to go on if the abort region determinator software quits
you cannot get by without the other
there is some judgment involved
and a good flight dynamics officer with these charts with no can make some judgment calls based on trends and performance
but we need both
you cannot have one or the other
it is very sophisticated
it is very subtle
and very small changes can make this software this predictor work
it is probably the best example of an expert system that i know of but it takes a great deal of care and feeding
and it is very very sensitive to the inputs
so it does take a lot of judgment and experience to interpret
along with that we need to talk about where you land
because here are all the places
we kind of closed down banjul and the gambia because we don't fly that inclination anymore
we do fly at the international space station missions and we have the tal sites i talked about
we could fly as high as fifty seven degrees inclination which we have done in the past but that is outside the range of what we need to do for the space station
the interesting thing is we get into the weather story and the weather forecasting and deciding which landing site you can go to is pretty complicated
i never studied meteorology in college
it is another subject i wish i had
that is not all
we talked about intact abort landings if one engine quits
but being good flight planners and controllers you always take it to the next level
what if two engines quit
what if all three engines quit
and so we have made agreements all the way up the east coast of the united states with the canadians to have places to land
and again we have agreements with all of these landing sites
we send people to train them about what would happen if the shuttle would land there
we check the weather
across the atlantic we have landing sites
again shannon ireland was probably the first dry patch of land that you can come to on the far side of the atlantic ocean
typical weather conditions there are five hundred feet overcast and rain and fog so we don't really probably want to use that
england is a little better
cologne bonn is a little better
and then we have all of these landing sites that we can look at
and that keeps the state department busy for us because we have to have international agreements to use any of these places
it took us two years to negotiate with the french government for emergency use only of their landing site
we typically don't have people at these landing sites other than our intact tal sites moron
zaragoza and istres le tube
but they are there
we would not hold the launch up if one of the landing sites for two or three engines out was not available but we would if we did not have an intact landing site which is the one engine out requirement
so we have requirements difference
one of the really fun things is when we get into the summer months we frequently cannot use some of these airports because they have air shows going on
and they would really like us to land the shuttle there during an air show but we don't
one of the things that we have to watch very carefully is where do we get rid of the external tank
now we can carry the external tank to orbit
there have been some very colorful viewgraph presentations put together of using the external tank as parts for a space station
totally science fiction
operationally it would be extremely difficult to do
carrying the tank to orbit would be very easy but we stopped just short of orbital velocity so that we can control the disposal of the tank
we now have international treaties that say you shouldn't put things in orbit without being able to put them in a place where they don't hurt people
we don't like to have satellites reenter and drop radioactive garbage or even just big hunks of metal on top of people so we have the external tank that we separate and drop just short of orbital velocity and use the small orbital maneuvering engines on the shuttle to provide the last couple hundred feet a second to get to orbit
and we have to plan this very carefully
we've done a lot of studies to find out when that tank will rupture how big the pieces are how far they've come apart
and we actually have flight rules talking about et disposal
this is a serious subject
everybody that flies an expendable rocket has to know where their stages are going to fall except maybe the russians who just drop them in kazak or used to
i grew up in new mexico in the one thousand nine hundred seventy s
we were very excited about the thought that white sands might be the launch site for the shuttle when it was under early design phase
when they picked solid rocket boosters that fell off just a couple hundred miles downrange
we knew that white sands was out of the running because that would put people at risk in the continental united states
and those kinds of decisions make for launch site decisions
yes sir
we're talking a little less than an hour
probably about forty five minutes from managing cutoff to the rupture at about let me see let me make sure i say that right one hundred twenty two kilometers
i don't operate in kilometers
i have to do the math but it's not long
it's less than one orbit
one orbit taken ninety minutes
it's about halfway to two thirds of the way around the world that we get rid of the tank
and this is a very important subject
in fact us laws and the eastern range that we have to work with to get launch clearance issues what we call notice to airmen or et disposal about forty eight hours prior to the shuttle launch to clear the ocean area and the air space
and this is all based on what we call a normal main engine cutoff
we made our guided cutoff to orbit
and here is a little picture of a problem we had earlier i want to talk about
here are the et disposal lines for the different inclinations
you can see that some of these get kind of close to the west coast of mexico but most of them fall out in the pacific ocean
and in particular here are the space station lines for disposal of the external tank
and as we go through the five minute launch window the inclination of the orbit not the inclination but the steering the shuttle has got to do to reach the internal space station changes the place where these tanks are disposed of
i think i have a better picture
and in particular we had a problem with this little island right here that we were infringing on the internationally recognized two hundred nautical mile limit for pieces
now if we do a normal insertion you will see that we have these typical nominal footprints based on where we were in the launch window
that is where all the pieces will fall
but we have dispersions based on trajectory and other dispersions that say we've got to clear to a ninety nine point seven percents probability this whole area or this is the area that results from all the dispersions at that level
so we don't want to drop pieces on people
once upon a time the united states air force thought that pitt island down here was a bird sanctuary and nobody lived there
and they sent out the notice to airmen to clear the area and we found out there are a couple of hundred people that live on this little island and the australian government got kind of bent out of shape over that
we had to negotiate infringing by just a few miles on the two hundred nautical mile circle around these guys just at the toe of the footprint and that went back to the french government
and that took us two years to negotiate
so they don't teach you everything you need to know in engineering school like negotiating with the french
disposal probability to your average diplomat like you say we don't get training for that
way beyond
now here is my funny story number one
dick richards who was program manager before me was asked to go on speaking engagement to american samoa
now i've been asked to speak a lot of places and they are always like boston or you know
ok this is a nice place to come but think about a speaking engagement in american samoa
so he had to go to american samoa to speak
and as they got ready to leave the airline pilot came on and said we cannot take off because they are going to launch the shuttle today
he had seen these tanks come in
he was not about to violate that airspace that they have been notified
and the launch time would put him past the point of no return where they had to continue onto hawaii and could not turn back to american samoa so he wasn't going to take off until he got word that the shuttle had either launched or scrubbed for the day
and there was a delay
and so dick richards got on his cell phone and called to houston and found out that we were sitting on the ground in florida based on bad weather at the tal site at banjul and the gambia
the passengers started talking about this
and they said you mean here we are in american samoa waiting on a shuttle launch from florida that has been delayed because of bad weather in west africa
the answer is yes
so what you do has an impact all around the world
ok enough about trajectory
and i have quite a lot i could talk about
let's talk about flight planning
one of the interesting things that we do onboard the space shuttle is we carry a lot of laptop
at last count i think we carried about eleven laptops on the last flight
but we don't rely on those laptops because they keep breaking
what we rely on is paper
spacelab flights are worse
i'd say the typical space shuttle flight that launches carries eighty pounds of paper checklists
every one of those pages lovingly crafted
we got maps and charts and we got all kinds of little cue cards that stick up on velcro all around the cockpit but by and large they come in books and here are some of the books
and mission control folks build those books understand those books can modify those books in real time and frequently do
one of the things we have to watch is printer paper onboard because we cannot run out of printer paper when we update checklists
and so we have to monitor how much paper we are using as we print out changes to the checklists onboard
yes sir
in so far as paper can be made low flammable
it is but it is paper and it will burn
the shuttle cockpit is full of flammable stuff
but it is tried to kept under control
it is tried to be protected
and of course we don't operate in a pure oxygen atmosphere as apollo did
it is very much like earth normal atmosphere
so no it is not fire proof
i wish it was
when we start a flight we start out with what we call a flight requirement
here is the flight definition requirement document
here is the flight we just flew and the basic parameters that we've got
which orbiter are we going to fly
the next flight up we're going to fly atlantis
which external tank is tbd
because we're still arguing about that
which solid rocket booster pair so on and so forth
which main engine by serial number
which flight software release
how many cryogenic tanks do we have the arm onboard and all this stuff
what is the manifest
well it is a station manifest for the utilization flight one point one which has got an mplm
it used to be called the miniature payload logistics module
now it is the multi purpose
that transmigration of acronyms over time have become more politically correct as a subject for a doctoral thesis i think
which launch pad we're going to operate out of
and how many days are we going to fly
how many people
we're going to carry seven up six down land at ksc and a bunch of remarks
this is kind of the basic definition
this is the starting point for a flight
this is what we get to start
and then we have to flush those out
we build a word document and we talk about the requirements for a flight
this is done at the program level
what is the launch window
what is the launch period
and many of these things are just flushing out the basic requirements you saw in the chart
here is an interesting one part of that flight requirements document that talks about eva spacewalks and talks about what we're going to do
and you will notice in great bureaucratic language the purposes of the evas are defined in another document that you have to go off and look at
so they're not any flight requirements documents but at least you got a reference where to go
and here are some of the things we are going to be able to do on this flight
and in fact we're going to have some contingency or emergency evas that can do these emergency things which we hope we don't have to do but we are going to be prepared to do
from that we develop flight rules and flight plans
here is a page out of the flight rules book that the ops people built
this is discussing how we take pictures of the external tank
you saw those beautiful pictures just a few minutes ago of the tank taken by the shuttle
and here are the guidelines
we're going to have to do a thrust from the plus x jets but we won't do it if we've got problems in the propellant system if we are way under speed if we're going to be dark because we don't have a flash that big and so on and so forth
and then that's the automated umbilical well camera
and then we've got the handheld photography
and we've got a whole bunch of reasons why we wouldn't do that
if we had to go to a backup software we don't want to do that because it makes it too sporty just all kinds of reasons
bob's people are thinking about this all the time
and in fact it's not enough to have the rule
here is the rationale behind that rule
why is it we decided you would or would not take those pictures which are very important to us for post flight analysis on a very detailed level
anything you see in italics font is what we call flight rule rationale which is the subject of interminable meetings and lots of haranguing and wrangling
here is a little bit of the inspect rule
we all know that the thermal protection system on the shuttle is not as robust as we would like it to be
we are going to inspect it every time
here are the priorities that are planned before flight for thermal inspection system
and we start with the most important and we work to the least important
your goal is to do them all but your plan is to have a plan ready if you run out of time
and then again the backup of why did we say that
and again it is more inspection priorities
i am not going to go over all of these
you can look at them
i want to come back to evas for a minute
here are some of the eva task objectives
this is something that they did just the other day onboard the international space station
this happens to be an international space station rule but it is closely related to the shuttle rules
they put in a new camera group
all this is perfectly clear to you guys all these acronyms
it takes about six weeks to learn the language when you come to work at nasa
and then we have something on the station called the floating point potential measurement device which is broken and became junk and they threw it overboard just a couple of days ago
well you get through all the rules and you come to a flight plan
and here is the flight plan
this is from the last flight
eileen collins here is what she is doing this particular day
this is flight day number three
this is what the pilot is doing
some time i will have to tell you the difference between pilot astronauts and mission specialists
doctor hoffman has his phd
he well versed in many things
and the pilot jim kelly one of my favorite guys i like him a lot flies jet planes so he gets post sleep exercise
and so we have all the guys
and what they are doing by the hour of the day and this is the overview by the way but these guys are going out on a spacewalk
and so here is their eva preparation purging their suits getting setup going out the door
here is the eva which are going to be outside for six point five hours
and this particular day they're doing the thermal protection system repair detailed test objective which you saw in the rules as one of the priorities
so we build this level of flight plan
now this is not it
we go to the minute by minute level detailed checklist this is the overview
this is kind of ok you've got to get up and brush your teeth and make breakfast and then go do some work kind of thing
and then we have all of our other procedure and checklist to make sure everything goes as perfectly as it possibly can
and this is just a day
and then we get all kinds of good little information down here
one of which is when we're going to be able to communicate with the astronauts
there was a revolution in flight control when we launched the tracking and data relay satellites
before we had tracking and data relay satellites and you just had ground stations to communicate with the crew we could talk to the crew about fifteen percents of the time eighty five percents of the time they were out of communications with the earth
now if you were going to the moon and you used a deep space network you pretty much had continuous comm
but if you were doing shuttle or any other low earth orbit kind of thing you could only talk to the crew for about fifteen percents of the time
and sometimes it lined up that you would talk to them three or four minutes every hour and a half
the russians have a huge problem in that they lost all of their tracking stations outside of geographical russia
and so they talk to their crew and plan their crew day on those parts of the orbit where they come over geographical russia
and they are a slave to that
and we launched the tracking and data relay satellite
now we can talk to the crew all the time
there is virtually no time you cannot talk to the crew
the crew gets really tired of that
they want to shut the radio off because mission control is always calling up and yammering at them
but it is a revolution because now we can get continuous data communications and command with the crew from the ground
and the bottom line on that is we're much more efficient
we don't have to wait for critical activities to happen until we get that communication link
yes sir
mars there are going to be four to twenty minute time delays in communications one way
yes
what are the preliminary plans for dealing with that
i don't know
no i'm sorry
i'm serious
a lot of people are really worried about that
it will be a different way to operate
and the folks that are working on those programs have got a real challenge
two quick questions
one is if you time the checklist i mean do you know how long page three is going to take
absolutely
and the other thing is do you have backup flight plans for every contingency pretty much where you know if this experiment fails per se we will pull out this flight plan and it reschedules everybody
no
in fact what we do is we have some emergency checklists
if you develop a leak in a cabin ok here is the emergency drill checklist to get you back on the ground as soon as possible
but the flexibility that i talked about in mission control is no we don't build complete different timelines
say if experiment a doesn't work we have a different timeline
what we do is we have the smart people in mission control that can take the existing timeline and build a new one
and in fact they do almost every night
i call it night
that is when the crew is asleep
it could be daytime in houston but it is when the crew is asleep
the last thing i want to talk about in a flight preparation
yes
if the crew fall asleep at the same time isn't that not a bad idea in case something goes wrong
shouldn't someone be keeping watch
mission control is watching a number one
and b number two there are enough automatic sensing
the computer is watching the really vital things so that if you've got a link in the cabin if you've got fire something like that happens the alarms will go off and wake the crew off
one of the case studies i am going to show is when mission control didn't get to watch so look for that in a minute
the post sleep period
ask jeff
the post sleep period is what do you do after your alarm clock goes off
there is cleanup shave get dressed and make breakfast which is a huge deal
this is not like taking something out of the freezer throw it in the microwave and eat it
it's a huge deal to cook and cleanup onboard
personal hygiene time
it's also time that most crews spend reading the morning mail
they don't get a newspaper but they get reams and reams of paper off the printer from mission control
you thought you were going to do an eva today but here is what we're really going to do
it's a really important time getting ready for the day so we allow the crews about an hour and a half of post sleep activities
and that is everything to get to work
yes
how do you decide what to tell the crew and who makes that decision
well that's an interesting discussion
the flight director of course is in overall charge
i should say that there are three shifts of flight controllers in mission control who are not ironmen but that work about nine hours
there is an hour handover period and so three shifts a day cover the day
a flight director is in charge of the team
the flight planners big flight activities officer we call them obviously have a big part of this
on a day like this when it's an eva day the eva officers have a big part of this
the capcom capsule communicator which is held over from mercury days is an astronaut
and hopefully a flown astronaut
not always but typically a flown astronaut that is the crew's representative in mission control
and the capcom is a very valuable resource in saying here are things the crew would want to know here are some things the crew already knows so we don't have to tell them
here you've built a plan that is going to overwork the crew or here you've built a plan that has got people sitting around with a lot of white space not doing anything getting bored
so it becomes a team effort
finally the flight director approves all uplink messages
yes
when do you tell the crew about that and who decides
well again it is a team so it's not this military hierarchy that orders come from the top
there is a team
the team will develop here is what is happening here is what we think we're going to do
the stories come together enough and here is the judgment factor
the flight director will tell the capcom to tell the crew in basic terms what the crew should know
now we have a lot of ways to communicate with the crew
and the shuttle we are very fixed obsessed with doing things on an open air to ground because in the old days they did some things kind of pine that got came out in press conferences that were bad
the station crew has got this ip phone internet protocol phone and they can call you
like right now if they had your phone number
they can just call you and talk on the phone and nobody knows what's going on
we have email with the crew
and a lot of things go up on email but all of those communication paths are utilized to get information back and forth to the crew
i probably ought to tell you one little short story
this is my sports analogy story so you will have to put up with that
working in mission control is like working in different sports
if you are the ascent entry shuttle team it is like playing basketball full court press all the time
you are always running short time but very intense
if you are a shuttle on orbit it is kind of like american football
you huddle up figure out what play you're going to do go out execute the play it worked or it didn't work you come back huddle up
it is very episodic but it can happen fast when it is happening when you're executing it
the space station is baseball
it's a very much different game
and one of the hard things as you move as a flight control from shuttle ascent to shuttle orbit to space station you have to accommodate the different rhythms of the game
the russians have a phrase for when the shuttle comes to visit the space station
they say the hurricane came through
because they have this nice orderly regime and these folks come and fill the place up and they're doing stuff and they're throwing things here and there and then they leave
and then we have to sort it all out and go back to our normal kind of placid existence
the last thing about flight planning is we talk about decision making
here is the simplified diagram for the chandra x ray telescope launch decision
axaf as you might know is the advanced x ray astrophysics facility which got renamed chandra telescope
and we have the ascent flight direction we have a mission director we have the ops director we have the launch director we've got the ksc people and all these people
then the prelaunch timeframe are all watching their parts of this
they're watching the telescope
they're watching the upper stage
they're watching the shuttle
they're watching a launch complex
somebody has got to decide and they all have got to talk to each other
and they are all by the way geographically in different places
and you've got to know who is responsible for what and who has authority to give information for what
because you don't want somebody in the axaf control center saying to the nasa test director your shuttle doesn't look right on tv
he doesn't know that his tv is out of adjustment or something
the plan to get all these people together what numbers they call what they loops they talk on has got to all be worked through
that is a real operational nightmare when you come to decision making and communications
we have literally thousands of people involved on a launch decision a payload deploy decision and looking at their piece part
it has to be clearly defined what you're looking at what you're going to do if it doesn't look right and so you have to spend a conservable amount of time planning that training for it and then executing
and i think we ought to break here if we're going to take a two minute break
thanks jeff
i hope this is helpful to you guys
it is not exactly the standard academic fare
i want to talk a little bit about systems engineering because one of the things we pride ourselves on in an operations community is that we are systems engineers
we're not mechanical aero what have you
you're a systems engineer and you've got to know a little bit about a lot
one of my favorite authors is robert heinlein
you may have heard of him
and his quotation about what a human being is i think is particularly appropriate to us
and somehow this didn't come off on the page but the bottom line is he comes out with specialization is for insects
i'm not going to go over the shuttle
you guys kind of know what it looks like and why it got there
i was looking at the syllabus of the class thinking i should have been in this class
structurally it is a complex vehicle
inordinately complex in my way of thinking
but that is because of requiring wings for the cross range large aero surfaces for the aerodynamics and of course being able to transform from a rocket to an on orbit spacecraft to a hypersonic glider is not easy
the main landing gear and the tires is a subject that i could talk about for a long time
and in the interest of time i took it out of my presentation
but if i ever get a chance to come back i think you probably had a discussion of that but operationally they are a bear
al louviere actually gave a nice talk
good
we are the only folks that operate tires in that regime other than the concorde
and you guys know what happened to the concorde
and we have real constraints on our tires and fret about them all the time
here is a list of the space shuttle systems that we divide up into
one of my favorites is right here in the middle
food
but it goes everywhere from the main propulsion system onto the waste management system
isn't that a great nasa acronym
this i think is an erroneously named chart because it says space shuttle systems
this ought to be orbiter systems
there are many other systems in the main engines and so forth
one i would like to talk just a little bit about is the environmental life control system
i think you probably had a little talk about that before
have you had an introduction to the environmental system before
i think it is a wonderful system
again it is wonderfully complex
we have water in the crew compartment so that if it leaks it is not hazardous
we have freon out in a payload bay so it won't freeze when it gets very cold
and we have this ammonia stuff for the last part of entry which is a pain in the butt but it is what it takes to get there
as you know the story basically we take oxygen and hydrogen in the fuel cells and make electricity
and as a happy byproduct we make water
my case study here is going to be what do we do with the water
these days most of the time we give the water to the international space station where they can electrolyze it using electrical energy from the solar rays and turn it back into oxygen dump the hydrogen overboard and breath the oxygen
we probably made this stuff by electrolyzing seawater so it is going this back and forth water to electricity to components
i wanted to talk a little bit about what we do with this water
some of the water is used as coolant through the flash evaporator system
it is very important to us but we typically run in excess and so we've got to get rid of it which becomes a waste management problem
if the crew doesn't drink it we have to dump it overboard
as i say we've tied into that system
and typically we've used the very pure water and give it to the international space station these days
i am sorry the print is kind of small
but right here is the dump valve
and one of these is the waste and one of them is the supply water dump valve where we dump that water out
now you'll notice something very interesting about that dump valve
we have a window in a hatch and we've got windows up here and we've got a tv camera here and a tv camera here and nobody can see what is going on
nobody can see what is going on coming out of that dump valve
the only way to see is to take the arm out and put it in a very sensitive position to look at what happened
in the old days they used to teach drafting
i always liked to look at these
the computer did not do this drawing
this is a work of art
this is the nozzle
the shuttle was developed in the one thousand nine hundred seventy s
we don't have a cad model of the shuttle
jeff asked me could you send us the cad model of the shuttle
we had a little arrow cad model of the outer mold line that the aero people use
there is no cad model of the shuttle
it exists on eight hundred thousand paper drawings
and when i came to work one of the things i got in the program office was a recommendation from the independent people to go off and computerize all of this
and so we went off and tried to develop an estimate to computerize it
they said it would take us eight years and cost about dollars forty million to convert these drawings from paper to the latest what's the cad model that everybody uses
catia
i cannot remember
we are not going to do it because we don't have the money so we're still working with the paper products
anyway here is the nozzle
the water comes in
there is an orifice and a set of heaters because you've got space on this side
and if you just push water out there it will freeze
you want to keep it from freezing so you've got the heaters in there
and this is a very tricky small orifice to design install and maintain
now here is what mission control sees
this is a plot of temperature well it's actually three or four things versus time
and what we have here is the first thing that happens is you turn on the heaters on the nozzle and the nozzle temperature warms up
then you open the dump valve and the water supply quantity goes down
and as the water goes out the nozzle temperatures jitter a little bit but they basically stay in this nice warm one hundred fifty degree temperature range
close the dump valve
the water quits flowing the nozzle bakes out turn the heaters off and it turns off
that is a normal water dump what mission control looks at all the time
the crew has got a timer
or better yet mission control calls and says start the dump now stop the dump now
sometimes they'll set a timer
here is a little bit of an abnormal signature
turn the heaters on the temperature comes up it plateaued out and it kind of does this kind of thing and people start scratching their heads what is going on
there is another interesting thing
here is one that warmed up didn't get quite as warm as it should have sputtered out and quit
what is going on
we actually took the arm out and looked at this nozzle and there was an icicle that had grown on the outside
and if you go back to this little drawing it turns out there is an offset here
and this nozzle has got a little offset to it
and they had rotated the offset one hundred eighty degrees so that the heat wasn't being applied properly and we were building an icicle
and we built probably a sixteen foot long icicle off the side of the shuttle on more than one occasion
and actually went out on one flight with the arm and knocked it off
actually knocked it off like you would knock an icicle off your eaves
the thing that clued us into this in addition to these temperature plots was the fact that we came back with ice stuck to the top of the payload bay doors
there was actually a lump of ice that survived reentry
at the kennedy space center there was a lump of ice on top of the payload bay doors
how would you get a lump of ice on top of the payload bay door
the reason is when this door is open right here it hangs over
and this icicle had grown all the way from the gap from the nozzle to the open door and had actually stuck on the open door
and when we closed the door the icicle broke off people theorize at the root and then carried this long stick of ice up and reentered that way
and when we landed most of it was gone but about a two or three pound ball of ice on the doors had survived reentry
now you might say well what is the big deal about that
we also found a big hunk out of the insulating tile on the oms pod where some of that had broken off and had traveled back during entry and struck the oms pod
this is not a good thing because you are depending in early phases of atmospheric flight on these thrusters for attitude control
and their propellant tank is right there inside that pod
not a good plan
there is an example of a mystery in mission control that we had to work our way through over the course of really several flights
and they redesigned the nozzle
here is the simplified drawing of the electrical system
i think you guys have seen some of these systems things before
we've got three fuel cells connected to three main buses which branch out into all these sub buses
if you are a flight controller you need to understand how you get electrical power because everything on the shuttle works on electricity
i am old enough now that i went to work in mission control before the simulator had programmed in the electrical system
and i was a propulsion guy oms rcs guy and we practiced all this stuff about the propulsion system and what would you do if different things happened
one day they released a new drop of the software and all of a sudden the trainers could cause electrical power buses to fail
we didn't know what the heck was going on but we learned in a big hurray because that is a big important part of our job
here is a simplified picture of the communication systems onboard the shuttle
this is the simplified
did you catch that
have you guys been through the communication system
we have s band fm s band pm and ku and it all comes in here and goes out there
and it is all cross strap so that if any one of these little black boxes doesn't work the integrated communications officer can send commands and change it all around
unless it was the communications boxes didn't work in which case we've got to call the crew on the other radio and tell them to go throw some switches which is very complicated
and if you don't talk to the crew from mission control you don't do anything
if you don't get telemetry from the vehicle from mission control you don't do anything
if you cannot command the vehicle from mission control you don't do anything
you might as well go out and get a cup of coffee because there is nothing you can do
if the comm systems folks are having a bad day and i will just add that's one of the most serious malfunctions that we would practice all the time so you had it cold
i mean if most things if they break you can talk to the ground get some help they're looking over your shoulder but if you cannot communicate with the ground at that point onboard your success in getting home depends on being able to analyze what is the malfunction and reestablish communication
so we take that very seriously
and i've got to tell you this is a serious design flaw in the shuttle
and here is a principle you need to remember
when the systems were categorized they were categorized on the basis of the severity of their failure mode
obviously the main propulsion system is what we call a criticality one system
if bad things go wrong in the main propulsion system really bad things could happen so they spent serious design effort making sure that nothing bad would happen
the communication system is a crit three system
that means that people did not spend the time to make a robust communication system
it is not as reliable as some of the other systems
and that was a huge mistake
and we have to fuss with this all the time
that is a huge headache
when you design something people say well communications isn't critical
absolutely wrong
communications is absolutely vital
you cannot do anything without communication
a flight rule on the books says if we lose all communication between a station and a shuttle the crew must land within twenty four hours
and we keep updated with just enough information so that they know where to land without communication
that is part of the news you get every morning is an update of if you lose communication these are the landing sites
that's right
here is where you want to go
here is the weather and here are the times
this is the simplified drawing of the data processing system
this is the hardware of the data process system
and you've got this general purpose computer that goes out through all these data buses to all these multiplexers and demultiplexers to talk to all these different pieces of gear
and we've got different buses to get into each of the black boxes
and you can switch ports and it is very reconfigurable and is a big pain in the butt
and if you want to operate as a systems flight controller you have to understand it cold
this is the software very simplified high level view of the flight software onboard the computer
you guys talk about the onboard computers on the shuttle
ok
how much memory does a general purpose computer have five hundred twelve k memory
not megs not gigs k
of course it works in ascent and vibrations and radiation and all these other things
very sophisticated software in a very small place
what i grew up on is the reaction control system
this has got helium pressurization going through a series of regulators and valves down to propellant tanks which get manifolded out to the various thrusters
you've got oxidizer and fuel
they come together and they make fire
and so i started life as a mechanical engineer specializing in fluids so i'm supposed to understand things like pressure and temperature and combustion
but i had to learn about valves which are mechanical and electrically operated that are operated through the computer system so all of those data buses on this page right here became very important to me
they are sometimes operated automatically by the software so i have to understand all the software
and then we get to what we call we redundancy management
we have this basic principle that we want to have more than one of a critical thing
and so the question is how do you monitor and manage that redundancy
and the reaction control system has got the most sophisticated redundancy management program in the shuttle
and it depends on instrumentation coming back through those multiplexers and signal conditioners going to the computer that when it commands through the digital autopilot those jets to fire they either do or they don't
and it tells it all about it
and then the crew gets notified back over here
and it is very complicated redundancy management
redundancy is a way to provide reliability
redundancy is not a means to an end
i noticed chris kraft said that the shuttle is quad redundant
that is not correct chris
the shuttle is not quad redundant
we have four computers
they are not quad redundant
now if you go to a lot of systems you only have three of
if you go to some systems that you have four of one cannot do the job
for example flight control
we have four flight control hydraulic channels that operate the elevons
one channel cannot operate that
it takes two
so you've got four but it takes two
that means i can lose two
so i am at best three redundant
i can lose two and fly with two
the trouble is if you lose two and they get in a fight with the other two it becomes very difficult to manage
one of my favorite systems is the inertial measurement system
the main requirement on shuttle avionics is that it is fail operational fail safe
you've got to be able to take the first failure and you can keep flying the mission as planned
you take the second failure and you're still safe to land because you've got one left
three inertial measurement units clearly we are fail operational fail safe
well no
if the first inertial measurement unit fails good to go we keep on doing what we're doing
but those last two if they disagree how do you know which one is telling you the truth
that is tough
we developed this mathematical scheme using matrices and the navigation quaternion that would give us the best chance
we have about a ninety nine point five percents chance of determining which imu is telling us the truth versus lying to us but it isn't foolproof
it takes people to manage it
we have opened ourselves through redundancy to a system in some cases where we don't have quad redundancy
we have four ways to fail the system
the reaction control system is one of my favorites because we have four jets on each side
for example the yaw jets in the aft that you need
so you would say quad redundancy
no i have four ways to fail
what i'd really like to have is just one jet that would do the job and was highly reliable
but i've got four jets that are leaky that get clogged up that lie to you on the instrumentation that you've got to watch all the time because i need at least two of them to do the job during entry
so be careful when you say things about redundancy
what you're really after is reliability not redundancy
redundancy is a way to reliability
and you build these incredibly complicated schemes to deal with redundancy to provide the reliability of the system level you need
simple is better let me tell you
complicated is not
i've got two stories from the trenches and then i'm going to quit
you guys have not been asking too many questions so that either means i am a brilliant lecturer or i'm putting you to sleep
this is not your standard academic fair
is this good for you guys
ok
yes sir
i have a question on the redundancy
chris kraft talked earlier this week about how because you have four strings that you should launch if one string is broken and not worry about it since you're still failsafe with what is left and that that would increase the turnaround time and you would be able to launch more often
one imu has failed we'll launch with the two because we know that ninety nine point five percents of the time that is good enough for us
do you have any comments on that
chris and i have had this discussion before
i have a technical response to this discussion
bullshit
we are not reliable enough to launch with anything down
this vehicle is barely reliable enough to make the mission as planned when we launch full up
if you want to build a spacecraft that needs two of or three of or four of
and you want to be able to launch with one broken on the launch pad like sometimes your airplane takes off with something broken that you the passenger don't know but the pilot does and say it is ok
we're not at that stage
that is a nice idea
that is a great goal
i think people when they thought about designing the shuttle thought that we ought to do it that way
it doesn't work with the design we've got
if you were going to build a new shuttle yeah i would put five imus on it
well shoot i would throw out the imus and i would put gps on it or something like that because it is more reliable
but we are not at a stage where we can launch with less than the normal stuff
our flight history is that we have terminated three shuttle flights because we lost redundant gear to the point where the flight rules said you needed to come home
now if you had launched with just enough gear so that the next failure puts you into shortened mission you would have terminated more flights early
the whole theory about the shuttle if you go back to the very beginning we are going to fly a flight a week
what sixty four flights a year originally
that didn't happen for a variety of reasons
if you flew sixty four flights a year the theory was if you got up there and something broke and you had to bring the payload back ok we would just role it into the one next week and we would have enough flights
it hasn't happened that way
spaceflight remains difficult because these flights are rare
the best we've ever done i think is ten flights in a year in one thousand nine hundred eighty five
and typically we're talking four or five flights in a year
these flights are rare
the pressure is on to get the maximum advantage out of every flight
and i think spaceflights are going to remain rare with the technology we've got into the future
that is probably a discussion for a future date but the fact of the matter is that shuttle does not have the reliability in its piece parts to launch with one of things down
wayne let me ask you a question to speak to you know just here at a classroom not as the shuttle manager and not for attribution
this is a danger when people
sheila widnall was here and told us about carb and their reputation
what is your feeling about the wisdom of ending the shuttle flights at the end of the decade
i have a couple of thoughts
first of all i am a shuttle hugger
i grew up with shuttle
shuttle is an amazing vehicle
it is a huge technological leap
i am very proud of what it has done
on the other hand we need a replacement
it has got some serious shortcomings
and if you look at the history of aviation and the first thirty years from the wright brothers to say the dc three that was about thirty five years a little less
dc three was the first economically practical airliner right
everybody wanted to compare the shuttle to the dc three
the problem is between the wright flyer in one thousand nine hundred three and a dc three in one thousand nine hundred thirty five or thereabouts they went through probably ten thousand designs
they had trial and error
we tried things out
we found out what worked we found out what didn't
they junked the bad designs
they took the good designs and they took the good parts of the good designs and built the next designs even better
they probably went through ten thousand variations on aircraft to get to that point
now we've been flying in space for about thirty five years
count them all
chinese russian american
how many space vehicles have there been
human space vehicles
less than ten
soyuz vostok voskhod mercury gemini apollo skylab shuttle shenzhou what am i missing
that's about it
how can you possibly advance that technology
it is ludicrous to think that you are going to advance the technology without doing the iteration that we saw in early aviation
we should have replaced the shuttle twenty years ago as a nation with a more advanced version that fixed some of the shortcomings that made it more economical to operate
we should have done a lot of things but for national reasons we didn't
so i am torn
i love the shuttle
it is a great machine
i spent my whole career with it
it gives us capabilities that we are going to give up frankly when we go to the cev
it's going to be a different kind of machine that does different kinds of things
and we are going to miss the shuttle i am convinced
but should we long ago have built a new one
absolutely
are we behind where we should be
absolutely
we need to invent the next generation of spacecraft and be ready to go on and invent the next one after that
the shuttle was designed for a ten year life
we should have been working on shuttle ii the day that columbia launched the first flight
ok
that is my perspective
anybody else
yes
this might be outside of the realm of the discussion but those ten thousand different designs that were done for aircraft were done largely by private sector right
there was a fair amount of government
and remember it wasn't all american
there was a large amount of government subsidy
and it was frankly a cheaper technology to develop
rocket technology is difficult to develop
i will go back to heinlein my favorite author
he says when you're in earth orbit you are halfway to anywhere in the universe
getting the first hundred miles off the planet is very hard but once you get in earth orbit or thereabouts you are halfway to anywhere in the universe
and we still have not cracked that nut
i really like the space elevator guys
it is science fiction but the idea is a good one
there ought to be a different technology other than rockets to get to space
somebody did a calculation that said if we had an elevator to the moon we could get to the moon for about dollars ten worth of electricity
of course there is a big if that goes in front of that rolling that elevator
so rockets are an exceedingly difficult technology
i want one of you guys to invent a new technology
aaron cohen he may have already told you this tells one of the great stories of all times about spaceflight
he talks about when he was in the management of the space shuttle program and the fact that the main engines were causing just awful problems getting them developed
stop me if you heard the story
and one day he woke up and said wouldn't it be great if somebody just invented an antigravity device and we could get away from rockets
wouldn't that just be great
and he thought about it a little while longer and said no it would still have braised welds and electronic parts and all the things that are causing us problems on the engines would cause us problems with the antigravity machine
get him to tell you the story
he tells it better than i do
but we need a better technology quite frankly
we need something that makes the transition from propellers to jet engines
we need something like that
the space shuttle main engines in terms of the rocket cycle thermodynamically are about ninety nine percents of the maximum theoretical efficiency for a hydrogen oxygen rocket engine
you're not going to do any better
we need a new technology
you might make them cheaper you might make them more reliable but you're not going to lift any more pounds to orbit
so we need that revolution
ok
well i'm passionate about it
anybody else
yes
you're talking to the wrong guy
of course it's a help
if you want to talk about whether it's a hindrance ask him after i'm gone
some of our astronauts friends which we'd shut up
but no seriously i think everybody would say that mission control is actually a vital part of the process
you've got to plan the missions
you've got to execute the missions
there are only so many people onboard the vehicle
these are not autonomous vehicles
that is another word that really sets my teeth on edge when people say space vehicles ought to be autonomous like commercial aircraft
it just sets my teeth on edge
have you ever seen what it takes to plan a commercial aircraft flight
there are more people on the ground than there are in the cockpit by a lot
and i'm not talking about the baggage handlers and i'm not even really talking about the mechanics that keep it flying
everybody has got to plan the routes got to make sure that they've got the manifesting right make sure that they've got the fuel right all that planning process you've got to have people that do that
saying you're going to get by without that shows a total ignorance of how the world really works
now i'm beginning to sound like chris kraft
i want to share with you a couple of stories
this is something you ought to past on your wall
the last law of robotics
the only real errors are human errors
mother nature does not make mistakes
if you flew your airplane into a thunderstorm and it crashes was it mother nature's fault
no you were stupid and flew your airplane into a place that it wasn't designed to handle
perhaps the weather forecaster gave you a bad forecast
perhaps your weather radar was insufficient and didn't pick up that nimbus cumulous cloud on its radar but it wasn't mother nature's fault
it was a human error
they used to talk about in aircraft accidents there were really three causes for aircraft accidents
there is pilot error which we all understand
the pilot turned left when he should have gone right you know something much more sophisticated than that
pilot error
there is mechanical failure
mechanical failure can come for two reasons
number one the aircraft was not maintained properly
i remember that alaska airline jet that went down because it had the mechanism in the tail that had the long spiral grooved shaft and they didn't lubricate it properly and it wore off
and finally they had no elevator control and the plane crashed
it wasn't maintained properly or it wasn't designed properly
it wasn't design properly to handle the environment that it flew in
so mechanically
or weather
well i submit that weather is not a cause of an accident
weather is a human failure because you need to understand what you're capable of operating your vehicle in and you don't operate it in environments that you're not capable of handling
the only real errors are human errors
it's either the pilot the engineer that designed it the guys that didn't maintain it properly or maybe the guys that didn't forecast the weather right
those are human errors
they are not acts of god
you need to understand the environment you're going to operate your spacecraft in
make sure you design it robustly so it doesn't come apart
makes sure you design it so that it can be maintained and you make sure the instructions for the maintainers is done properly
and finally you've got to train your crews so they can pilot it properly
ok
one of the things that the shuttle doesn't do well is navigate on its own
the shuttle has an inertial navigation system
we're trying to upgrade it to gps
we've been trying to upgrade it to gps for ten years
maybe we will get the next vehicle endeavor out of its maintenance depot period with gps and fly it with gps but right now we fly it with inertial measurement systems
those inertial measurement systems developed right here at the charles stark draper lab have some drift in them
after about a day their knowledge of where the shuttle is creeps off
it creeps off enough so that you could not reenter safely because the error in the onboard knowledge of where the shuttle is is different from where the shuttle actually is
in addition to that the integration over time doesn't give you a good state vector so we track the shuttle from the ground with radar and update what we call the state vector position velocity and direction six components at least once a day
on sts thirty two mission control screwed it up
there is a long flight
the ninth day of the flight the inco officer sent a bad command that caused the shuttle orbiter to lose attitude control
and if the propulsion system had been configured differently they would have run the little jets
if they had been on the big jets we might have used up enough gas so that the crew could not have reentered safety
this is a serious error
it also happened at about three point zero in the morning
i would offer to you that you ought not do critical things in the wee hours of the morning
writing term papers running somewhat hazardous experiments are not things you want to do at three point zero in the morning
that error was recognized and corrective actions were taken immediately
but due to some other circumstances it was a near thing
we were out of control and out of communications for about ten minutes
and this was in the middle of crew sleep
what they did basically was to uplink a state vector that told the computer that the position of the orbiter was somewhere outside the milky way galaxy
i mean it was that kind of thing
ok
here is the story for the night
this is seventeen days twenty three hours to eighteen days gmt
this was in the early part of the year
this is a one hour time period
the crew is awakened in the middle of crew sleep because an onboard smoke alarm goes off
there was no fire
it was just an erroneous alarm but it woke the crew up
now when you are the flight control team and you are working when the crew is asleep your number one goal is to keep the crew asleep
don't let them wake up
so this flight control team has already failed
they allowed an erroneous alarm to wake the crew
a little bit later the flight dynamics officer says we need to reinitialize the state vector which is something that we normally do about once a day
it is interesting that this is in the middle of crew sleep
normally it is done when the crew is awake but the flight dynamics officer says we need to uplink a new position and velocity sort of vectors
the flight director says did you do a good job fido
fido says of course we did
flight say ok you have a go to uplink that vector
the integrated communication officer gets the word from the flight dynamics officer
i want you to go to the computer and get vector number umpty ump and uplink it to the crew
and the integrated communications officer uplinks the vector to the onboard system
now there is a check in the onboard system that goes into a buffer in the computer
and that buffer gets sent telemetry back to the ground and the ground computer compares what is in the onboard versus what is sent and they should be the same
we send about five thousand commands in the course of a two week flight and normally they always compare
this particular time there was a problem some radio noise or something and the data got scrambled
and it came back to the ground and the computer put out the little words data reject
in other words the command that you sent is not what is onboard the integrated communications officer
the backroom is doing other things
the guy in the front room integrated communications officer checks the display and says for whatever reasons at three point zero in the morning ok punches the button to send the execute
in other words move the data from the buffer into the navigation software
it is wrong
but he just makes a human error and sends it
his backroom guy because we always work in teams is doing something else and didn't check his work
normally there is a check and balance
before you send buffer execute you say to somebody else does this look ok to you too
they missed that check
what happens
they send this command
the shuttle thinks it is in orbit around i was going to say alpha centauri but it was a lot farther away than that doing what we call local vertical local horizontal hold
well now it's doing lv lh around the star in the andromeda galaxy i guess and it goes out of control
not fast
now this doesn't tumble end over end
it reaches three degrees a minute rate which is not a high rate but you're moving out of your attitude
well what happens
when you move out of your attitude the antennas are no longer pointing at each other
the shuttle antenna is no longer pointing at the tracking and data relay satellite so command data voice go away
loss of signal
the worst thing the flight director can hear is loss of signal with the crew
ok
we got lucky because about ten minutes later it just happened to be acquired back through the satellite
it just happened to be acquired back
we got lucky and they called the crew
the crew switched to a manual autopilot turns on the big jets restores the attitude and life goes back to normal
the crew now has been awakened twice by the way
they are going to be grumpy the whole next day
if the big jets which use a lot of gas had been on in that ten minutes we could have used the entire entry allowance of propellant
ok
as anything there is always a chain of events
the flight dynamics officer was unable to do this navigation state vector prior to crew sleep because of the vehicle activity
in other words they had been doing maneuvers and they had to get the radars to track to build a solution
plans were made to uplink the state vector during sleep which is not terribly unusual but not the typical situation
during a sleep period and i don't know why they put during a sleep period we typically can have telemetry dropouts and radio frequency interference and conditions which cause telemetry dropouts
they were predicted because of the orbiter attitude
the antennas don't always point in the best part of the antenna pattern
that we're going to have that
we had the onboard smoke alarm that woke the crew up
we let them go back to sleep
this is the same thing i went through
twelve seconds after he sent the back command the backroom guy this did trivial recorder command and we saw that they were miscompared
and this is really the key
seventeen seconds after calling up the display the backroom attempted to question the decision but too late the button had been pushed by seventeen seconds
ok
the flight dynamic officer is looking to see if we get a good state vector on the board
he didn't see on the board
inco said i sent it
what's going on
the data processing system officer reports that the computers both of them the guidance and navigation computer and the system management computer are clocking internal errors
they have a term for this
it's called divide by zero
computers don't like to do that arithmetically
they send an alarm
the propulsion system officer reports continuous jet firing
the guidance officer reports that they are huge autopilot errors and high vehicle rates
when i said three degrees i meant three degrees a second quite a lot
capcom says wake up
capcom we need to tell the crew something is going on
wake the crew up
voice link is normally disabled during crew sleep
because every once in a while somebody pushes the button and wakes the crew up during crew sleep so we configure it so that we cannot do it
so we had to reconfigure the ground voice system to allow the capcom to communicate
we lost the one satellite
we had the wrong antenna selecting
and then ten minutes everybody thought they were dead
we woke the crew up they put the vehicle on manual mode and life returned to normal after the new state vector onboard
that never made the press i don't think
it was directly caused by operator error
he clearly did things outside of what he was trained to
and these are all nice little bureaucratic words saying that everything worked like it was supposed to except for the guy
and here is what we did in our great bureaucratic mode
procedures were updated
software was updated
rules were updated
consol handbook procedures were updated
work guidelines of making people work ten or twelve days in a row on nine or ten or twelve hour shifts particularly on a nice shift were revised so we let people off
and basically what we did was we added more checks and balances to the system
now is that the kind of thing that you do when you are designing a spacecraft
why would you design a spacecraft where you had to update the state vector every day
why would you design a spacecraft that would crash into the surface of mars when it was supposed to go into orbit around mars
you've got to be careful when you design your system of the unintended consequences of your operation
and if you don't think very clearly about what you're putting on the operators you'll force them into positions like this so you've got to think about the operation
not just is the wing going to fall off because the wind gust is going to exceed the structural capability
you have to think about the operations
i've got one more
do we have time for one more
if you can do it in two minutes
ok
this main engine combustion chamber the main engines have a computer that looks at sensors that controlled our mixture ratio and things
one of these sensors plugged up
and they give you the thirty second version
you can read it all
the ground had been using a pressure check with a little pressure meter that had a neoprene rubber o ring
and when they pulled the pressure gauge off it left the neoprene rubber there and stopped up the sensor
and because of that the engine nearly shut down in flight
and if mission control hadn't been paying attention and disabled that sensor during real time we would have done our first return to launch site abort on that engine
so little things count for a lot
small instrumentation things count for a lot
i hope this has been helpful to you
anybody got any other questions before i sit down
one question from the back
well my thoughts are i'm excited that nasa's got the goal of going back to the moon and mars i wish we'd never gotten away from that
i'm working really hard in the space shuttle program to free up money so that exploration can do what it needs to do
i'm not in a position to know whether they've got enough to do their job
it does look a little tight i don't know time will tell
but i'm just excited to have the opportunity to head in that direction
i'm going to give you the diplomatic answer
this will be professor cohen's kind of last complete lecture although on the last day of classes the plan is we're going to take some of the time just to talk over what we've done and review things
and it will be really oriented towards general aspects of systems engineering
and aaron i will turn it over to you
thank you
today i'm going to lecture primarily on systems engineering but management as it relates to systems engineering
i have several checks and balances
and of course today i've got people from the draper laboratories and people from the predecessor to draper laboratories mit instrumentation laboratory are going to check me to see if i say the right thing
first of all i would like to say to you as a class that i read your last submission reports and really thought they were outstanding
they show a great deal of interest a great deal of understanding and a great deal of initiative
and so i really compliment you
and i'm sure your final reports will be better but they really were very very very good
you've heard a lot of people talk previously starting with in my way of thinking dale myers who was sort of the person who started the program in washington at the time
you didn't hear from another very important man george miller who was really dale's boss at the time
but george is still alive is still doing very well
and you didn't hear from a lot of other people
you did hear from chris kraft which sort of set the tone you might say for a very interesting and understanding man who really knows what he's doing and says what he thinks
but there are several other people that i would like to talk about that had a great bearing on my career in terms of systems engineering
there were two people both who have passed away
one is joe shea
and joe was a very remarkable engineer
he was program manager of the apollo program at the johnson space center then left and became vice president of raytheon here and then became a professor at mit in the aero astro department
and i thought he maybe taught the forerunner to this course
he taught systems engineering
and joe shea was actually the best systems engineer i've ever met so i am going to talk a little bit and give you some understanding of my interaction with joe
the best job i ever had you might say really is i've had a lot of different jobs but my first job was really working with the mit instrumentation laboratory where i met a great number of people
i'm not going to mention everybody because it would fill up the time
they taught me systems engineering but had it not been for the mit instrumentation laboratory we wouldn't have gone to the moon on the schedule we went on
they really did a fantastic job all these people
i mean they were just you might say giants
there were great people at rockwell at north american aviation such as george jeffs and great people at grumman such as joe gavin and other places but i have to say that the mit instrumentation lab really carried the ball on understanding how to do guidance navigation and control
and if you read some of the comments by george low who is the other person i am going to talk about george low is another giant
he says the most complicated system on the apollo spacecraft was the guidance navigation system if you read what he said
and could you really hit a target two hundred forty thousand miles away and bring it back
but let me get back to joe shea
i said he was a great systems engineer
and joe shea taught me a couple of things
one he taught me not to be afraid to make a decision
he said the fact that you are in charge the fact that you have looked at all the information the fact that you know the details you are the best one to make a decision
and if you could make a timely decision and your battering average is a little over sixty percents you're doing very well
but the fact you made it timely and the fact that you understand it you can make a change
you can change if you are wrong
and that always stuck with me not to be afraid to make a decision
because many times as you go through your role in systems engineering you're not going to have all the information to make a decision on a timely basis
it is just not going to be there especially if you do a program that pertains to advanced technology advanced research and development
that is one thing that is important
another thing that joe shea brought to the table
during the apollo program before we had joe shea we would sit around a conference table in the early sixty s trying to figure out what systems engineering was but we couldn't really explain what we had to do
we didn't know what we really had to do
but when joe shea came he brought with him the insight of what you needed to do to do systems engineering
now this is the apollo stack as you see in on the pad you might say
the launch vehicles
the launch vehicle
the first stage second stage
then you get to the lunar module the command and service module launch escape tower
that is what it looks like on the pad
well joe shea gave me probably the toughest job and one of the most important jobs that i had in my career
he said aaron you are going to be in charge of resolving all the icds the interface control documents
that is all the interfaces between all the stages between the command and service module and the lunar module between the command and service module lunar module and the stack between the command and service module lunar module and the launch complex
there were about a thousand icds involved in that
and that was a formidable task because an interface control document you cannot design without the interfaces being defined and you cannot define the interfaces without the design
so it is really a chicken and the egg type of thing
and it turns out that was a turning point in my career because we did do that
in fact a little sideline a little interesting story
he anointed me to do this job but didn't just leave me there
he took me to the contractors he took me to the mit instrumentation lab he took me to rockwell he took me to grumman and he took me to the marshall space flight center and kennedy space center
and the funny part about it he took me in to see von braun which i didn't know about
i didn't know von braun
and he said wernher this is aaron cohen
we were in his big office at marshall
he said he is going to resolve all the icds all the interface control documents
and wernher von braun said that is wonderful
what is an icd
so i knew i had a problem there right away that the head charge of marshall didn't know what an icd was
but that was a little bit of a sideline on it
i did have the job to actually resolve all the interface control documents
and that turned out to be one of my most interesting most challenging jobs as a young engineer
it really taught me systems engineering because one of the important parts of system engineering is understanding where the interfaces are and how you get the interfaces resolved
and you could imagine trying to get grumman at that time at north american aviation and mit instrumental labs to agree on an interface document
i mean it wasn't the easiest thing in the world to do
yes
did you have a question
i was just wondering aside from technically making sure that the interfaces are working and everything what is involved in resolving an icd
that's a good question
well first of all i am going to talk a little bit more about icds in general
icds you can define in several categories
one is mechanical or physical icds bolt hold patterns just how things bolt together
the other you might say is electrical icds what kind of electrical signals are sent and electrical interfaces
and the other are functional icds
one of the big icds we had to resolve was a term called guidance reference release
marshal had an inertial measurement unit in their instrument unit and we had to have that synchronized with our system or with the system in the command and service module
what is involved in it is you sit down and you talk
you have a draft icd
and we had these big meetings
we had them at the kennedy space center
i don't know if you've ever been to the kennedy space center but we actually fill the firing room with people
and each group had a certain set of draft icds and they would sit down in working groups and decide what had to be done to get the interface compatible in terms of the three phases physical electrical and functional
and you just work out the details
aaron probably now in the twenty one st century we ought to add data icds
data icds yeah
well now things have changed probably a lot since i've been involved in it
i mean remember mars polar lander
we had english units coming over
yeah that's right
and the people thought they were getting metric units
so the data icds are also critical
you know and a lot of things are very simple and mundane
i could tell you a story with the crew
when we said you're going to have in flight maintenance with the crew
and we gave the crew to change out a component but instead of taking the screw out very easily we had actually put loctite in the screw so we couldn't undo the screw
there are very simple interfaces that have to be resolved
some are mundane some are very sophisticated
i don't know if that answers your question
the problem is there is no f ma
there is no closed form solution that tells you exactly how to do it
you just have to sit down and work it because the design hasn't been complete but you have ideas
you float ideas you negotiate you arbitrate and then you come up with a decision
the main thing is you've got to make a decision and somebody has to be there to make a decision
that was my job to make a decision
that was what joe shea left me with
and people that know him will agree that he was an outstanding engineer but also probably one of the best systems engineers
larry do you know what course joe taught when he was here
yes systems engineering
he taught this course
yes
i thought he taught this course because i know i came up and gave a lecture for him
until he was taken ill
let me talk about another person that was very prominent in informing my career
his name was george low
after joe retired george low became the apollo program manager at the johnson space center
and george was very much a disciplinarian
he always had time to see you
but there were several criteria in seeing you
you had to tell him what your subject was how long he wanted and why you wanted to see him
so when you met with him if you asked for fifteen minutes you had fifteen minutes
and no matter how important the job was if you didn't finish was you had to say in fifteen minutes you were out the door
and you only did that once
but you didn't ask for too much time either because you got penalized if you said you needed an hour and you only took thirty minutes
so he was very much a disciplinarian
he actually after he retired from nasa after he retired from the apollo program became deputy administrator at nasa and was very instrumental in the shuttle program and then retired and became president of rensselaer polytechnic institute
so george had a very illustrious career
he passed away several years ago
one incident might be of interest to you and i recall it very vividly
i don't know if everybody else does but we were getting ready to go to the moon on apollo eleven
this is on apollo
and you monitor all the systems very carefully
and we were monitoring the inertial measurement unit in the lunar module which is right here
and for some reason or other the drift rate changed fairly drastically
now it was still in spec
the drift rate was still in spec but it changed
and to get to the lunar module and change out an inertial measurement unit on the pad is pretty hard to do
first of all the lunar module has very little structure to it
it is made out of reynolds wrap really
i mean it doesn't have very much structure to it
and so we reviewed it with all the people involved reviewed the data and we concluded very clearly that there was nothing wrong with it
and so we went to george low and we told him a unified story the mit people the mit instrumentation people the rockwell people everybody the jsc people
and george low listened very attentively and then said can you explain why it changed
and we said no we're going to change it out
that is the thing that always stuck in my mind
if there is something that you don't understand then you need to take some action to fix it
and to me that was a very important part of my learning process
and so those were the people you might say that really had an effect on my systems engineering thought process
the other thing i want to talk about with you today is you heard a lot of people talk that i would class as subsystem managers
you heard tom moser talk about structures
i don't know if i can recall them all
al louviere talk about the mechanical systems
you heard bob ried talk about aerothermodynamics bass redd about aerodynamics henry pohl about reaction control systems auxiliary power units and hydraulics walt guy about environmental control systems
you heard of these people
these people are what i call subsystem managers that actually in some regards work for me and in some regards didn't work for me
and that is what you call a matrix management system
now i'm going to talk about matrix management
matrix management was actually a very popular management system several years ago
i don't know if it is used today or not but matrix management is a type of management basically used by large organizations
primarily what it is are large projects organized with teams that work on a functional rather than a project basis
in other words these people i just talked about actually had two bosses
they had a boss in their engineering organization a very famous man named max faget
and then they had another boss which was so famous me
and i was their boss that controlled the project's cost schedule and performance
and they actually reported to me on that
but they actually had two bosses
and so you do that for several reasons
you do that in order to conserve resources
and many large companies do that
the other way of doing it actually would be to put all that engineering talent in the project office
and you could see the advantages and disadvantages
i will show you more explicitly the advantages and disadvantages on that
the advantages are that you have a dedicated organization
the disadvantages are that when the project is over there is no place for these people to go
and i don't know what you use
you have a matrix at the draper labs today
i'm not that close to industry
do most companies use matrix today
yes most aerospace companies
there are too many projects that change all the time and somebody has to be responsible for the people
see that's an interesting part
we at the johnson space center didn't have that many projects
we only had really maybe one or two projects but we still used matrix management because there is a check and balance on matrix management which you don't get on centralized or project management
there is advantage to it
there are some disadvantages to it
his rotation lab was project oriented at the time when we did apollo
you were project oriented because you had one project and you were just project oriented all nasa project
so there are advantages and disadvantages
i had some dealings with ford motor company and i think ford motor company actually uses matrix management
i think most large companies use matrix management today
anyway that's really the advantages and disadvantages of matrix management
and a lot of things i have already said
under matrix management all the people who do one type of work are in a pool
for example all the engineers in one engineering department report to an engineering manager
that is what i said
they all report to an engineering manager
in this case the name was max faget
and if you do history in the space program max faget becomes a very prominent name
he was really you might say the original designer of the mercury gemini and a lot to the apollo spacecraft configuration
so you will run into his name time and time again
but the interesting part about it is that max and i used to go at it tooth and nail
i mean his people would want to do something like a walt guy
walt at that time was a very stubborn person
and he would want to do something and i wouldn't want to do it
well he would go to max
and then max and i and walt would have a meeting at the summit with chris kraft
it was a common point
we all went to see chris kraft
sometimes i won and sometimes i lost but i learned actually to love it
even though it frustrated me i learned to love it because there was that check and balance on me that i could not do something that was going to actually be wrong
somebody else was going to catch me if i did something wrong
now i honestly do not know today what nasa uses whether they use matrix management on the shuttle program or on the space station program or how they are going to do it
do you have any idea
the shuttle was certainly much more project oriented
we don't have the same i mean there is an engineering division at jsc but during the shuttle that was it started out matrix management
i think it really decreased and there was no more max faget running things in that same way
and so that in my mind at least in my way of thinking is probably one reason why problems occurs because you don't have that independent check and balance
there is a very good reason why matrix management i think is important even though you don't have a number of projects that would cause you to do matrix management
well this says these same engineers may be assigned to different projects and report to a project manager while working on that project
therefore each engineer may have to work under several managers to get his or her job done
and that is what i was saying
it just turns out that you do have that type of problem in doing that
proponents suggest there are two advantages to matrix management
first it allows team members to share information more readily across task boundaries
second it allows for a specialization that can increase the depth of knowledge
you can see how if you have a matrix manager you can call on more resources to go back to your home organization facilities in terms of testing
i have worked under and when i was in industry total project organizations
and it has a lot of advantages and disadvantages also
the disadvantage of matrix management is that employees can be confused due to conflicting loyalties
i mean was walt guy loyal to max faget or was he loyal to aaron cohen
now max actually gave him in raises but i controlled the dollars for the project
but you're right that is what counts
they call that pink ticket
he was actually pink ticketed to max and actually worked for me
and i had to use all my persuasion to get him to do the type of job
properly management cooperative environment however can neutralize these disadvantages
in apollo there was one program
right
for example we had air force navy and nasa
right
and we were doing accuracy evaluation for each one
and we were developing the whole software from scratch for each one
it was different language and different computers and you couldn't compare results
right
and when you have one engineering organization that does the same at least you can compare
you have the check and balance
right
that's a very good point
yes jerry
whether you a project organization you had your thumb on the people who had to produce
in the matrix organization off times the engineering manager would shuffle his man right out from under you to another project
oh that's right
that's what i had to contend with
on the other hand my strong personality and my good will kept it from going that way
and there was a certain amount of esprit de corps that they wanted to get the job done
in the end it is the people
it's the people
it doesn't matter what organization
that's right
if the people are wrong no organization is going to work
well that's absolutely right
you have to have the right people
well that's why i brought some of these people to talk to these students because these people were the people i worked with
even though we argued at times
there was nobody that argued more than henry pohl and i did but he is usually always right
but you can learn to live with it
matrix management can put some difficult on the project managers because they must work closely with other managers and workers in order to complete the project
the functional mangers may have different goals and objectives
i was saying this as i present these charts but i think you can visualize that
and don't hesitate to ask questions because you've got a lot of people here in the room today that can help answer these questions
yes
the point about checking and balance
you have several managers
yes
from my understanding you have maybe a functional manager and then you have
well let me tell you what i mean by check and balance
let me give you a specific example
let's say henry pohl on the reaction control system wanted to do more testing or wanted to do more stability testing
and i looked at my budget and i looked at where we stood in the schedule and i said we just cannot afford that we're just not going to do that
i made an arbitrary decision
well henry would be very upset about that and he would go to max his functional manager
and max would say boy you're right aaron is crazy
he would then call a meeting with chris kraft between henry max and myself to decide what we were going to do
and then chris was the final word the man you met
he's a pretty strong guy
and if he agreed with max if max had a convincing story he would turn me around and then we would do the testing
and i would just have to find the money some place
but if i could convince chris that max was overdoing it then i would win
and normally i lost but that is ok
do the engineers in any of these organizations out of matrix management feel that they have too many managers
well it is frustrating to them a little bit
yes they did
it's frustrating because they had to feel that they were working for two different people
and it is a little bit confusing to them
i mean they had two loyalties
that's what i pointed out
they essentially had two different loyalties
one to their functional manager who paid their salaries and the other to me who really had the money for the project and the schedule
so yes it is a very tough thing to do
but as you could tell by talking to these people that experienced it both in apollo and in the early days of shuttle they were very satisfied with the results
that is why it is very frustrating to some of us to see the way things are going because we carried over most of these people you talked to or are here in the room today worked on apollo and then went and worked on shuttle
we had the same process
we had the same joe shea george low process that we did
yes
well that's absolutely true
your decision making process in matrix management turns out to be a little bit more cumbersome than if you have direct control
in other words if you have your thumb on everybody you can get a decision pretty quickly
on the other hand you can violate some good checks and balances so you give up the process of a rapid decision making process versus having some good checks and balances
does that answer your thoughts
ok
i am going to leave that subject unless there are any other questions on it
can i just bring up something
sure
and i welcome your opinion on this elliot
and that is there has been a big change in nasa recently which is affecting management
and that is because nasa has gone over to what they call full cost accounting which means that during all of this time the engineering organization maintained their engineers
that's true
they paid the salary and then they would be assigned to projects as required
the system as it's now working is it's supposed to be much more like in industry where the time of every engineer has to be billed to a specific project
and if you don't have a project to bill your time to ultimately you become redundant
and so those of you who read aviation week and space news i hope all of you do are aware that nasa is doing a lot of downsizing
it puts a lot of constraint on management
now in industry obviously people have to be paid for
but are there always enough projects to bill people to
well there is never a situation that you have the exact number of people
you're either short of many people which is now the situtation at draper or you don't have enough money
what you do in a place like draper we have our own money
it's called internal research
and we use some money and we keep those people
but those have to be people the company believes can be used in the future
there is no point in keeping people that nobody wants
actually the matrix system and i talked about it with jerry because we are doing the evaluation that is why i have to leave is really sorting the people out
because when it was a big project it was a big family
the guy owned them
he knows them
that's true
now you work at the function organization and we send you to work he wants the best people for his project
he will say well i don't want this guy
now if it is a mediocre guy we will say look you cannot have the best
but if it is somebody who is very weak we will say for one time ok maybe he didn't get along with the program so put him in another program
but if we get the feedback it doesn't work there we know there is a problem
in that way we weeded out a lot of people that if you have the old system probably will stay and make us less efficient
nasa will be more efficient now i think
i think that is true
on the other hand it causes a lot of pain
it is very difficult to let people go but that is part of management
it's not just going to parties
that's right
yes there is a question
i guess another angle on the very tough to let people go i've noticed that it is extremely difficult from a bureaucratic standpoint to let somebody go in government
and i'm just wondering with full cost accounting ok you've decided it is time for this person to go but there is just a lot of politics and bureaucracy paperwork to go through to get somebody out of the organization
there are civil service laws which have to be complied with
it is difficult
and i have to say i agree with elliot
in the long run i think nasa will become more efficient
well to answer your question there are several ways to let people go
one is if they've really done something bad
you have a board and you go through it and you release them
the other is if you nasa has a downsizing which is called a rif reduce in force
then you can arbitrarily let people go
i didn't mean to interrupt you jeff but those are two ways
i will just add the third way which nasa is also doing is you can offer what they call buyouts
they offer up to dollars twenty five point zero if you will take early retirement so a lot of people do that
and companies not government have a much easier time
i don't know how draper is but companies have a much easier time letting people go than other places
but that was about all i was going to say on management
now i'm going to get into you might say the interesting land of systems engineering and talk about systems engineering a little bit
my charts are sort of yellow because they go way back
it turns out systems engineering has been studied a long time a lot
and there are many aspects of systems engineering that some people in the room may or may not agree with
i've had time to reflect a little bit from my days at nasa in both apollo and shuttle and in space station
and i was as i say director of the johnson space center i was deputy administrator
acting deputy administration under goldin for a year and then i taught at a and m
and all that time i have had time to reflect and i have had time to do some you might say research of what i thought systems engineering was and how you explain it
i want to try to do that today
people in the room may or may not agree with it but it is my thought process
and it turns out that much of this information was gathered from studies done by the military mil specs on systems engineering
they have spent an awful lot of money studying systems engineering
and many of these charts are plagiarized you might say from those studies and they look sort of like they are yellow
and they are
but let's start off with systems engineering heritage
systems engineering as we pointed out is not new
the pyramids you know that was a real systems engineering problem
i don't know how they did it but it was a real systems engineering problem
i don't know if even jim nevins could do that
that was a tough job
broadcasting service and standards
now most of the time when you talk to people about systems engineering in fact i've done a lot of research on that they talk about systems engineering as operations research
well i don't think that can be further from the truth of systems engineering
i think it is a tool maybe used in systems engineering but it is not really systems engineering
the rand corporation developed the systems analysis
the bell labs telephone systems
that was of course where joe shea came from
joe shea came from the bell labs at the time
nasa military systems and these are mil standards
and the army
and then systems engineering management guide for belvoir defense systems management college
there were a lot of studies done for systems engineering
and we in apollo were trying to do systems engineering in the one thousand nine hundred sixty s for apollo is when we tried to start to do it
by the way these charts are not on the web but i will give these to jeff and they will be on the web
trans highlighting the need for increased systems engineering there is a need to manage the total picture in the area of increasing system size and cost but even a small project has systems engineering
if you can think of how you design a bicycle how you design an automobile i mean these are very complex problems
they are not simple
they are really systems engineering problems
but the increasing technological growth and specialization increasing systems complexity you know the pc is a fantastic systems engineering problem
and i guess bill gates saw the need for a true systems engineering job and made a lot of money on it in terms of what he did understanding systems engineering
increasing sensitivity to environmental factors and increasing costs of life cycle
all those things make the trend in systems engineering important
and as i look at your reports wherever you got it i think you have a pretty good knowledge of what systems engineering is
so i am not sure this lecture is going to help you that much because i think you do look at it from a systems engineering standpoint
by the way my last topic is going to be cost analysis
i'm sure you're waiting to hear that because cost analysis is very hard for you to come to grips with
and i am going to talk a little bit about how you would go about doing a cost analysis which may not dot all the is and cross all the ts for you
but i am going to try to do that
we're going to take a break at about eleven point zero and then i will have some time to go through cost analysis
well what is systems engineering
i don't know
you may not agree with this but systems engineering is the application of scientific and engineering to transfer an operational need into a description of system performance parameters and of systems configuration through an iterative process
now let me give you a needs statement
when president kennedy said we are going to send men to the moon and return them safety within a decade that is a perfect needs statement
it doesn't tell you how to do it he didn't put a cost constraint on it he did put a time constraint on it and he told you what you had to do but didn't tell you anything about how to do it
that is a very good needs statement
i don't know if he did that for that reason but he gave the public and nasa a very good needs statement
now our job was to transform an operational need into a description of system performance parameters and the system configuration through an iterative process
and that is an exercise left to the student
that is not easy to do but that is really what you need to do
now to integrate technical parameters and insure capability of all interfaces that is what i talked about
you talked about physical functional and program interfaces
they call them different things but basically interfaces become a very important part of the systems engineering process
and the other factors into the total engineering are to meet cost schedule and technical performance
what is that
i think professor hoffman talked about that
that is the three legged stool
it is schedule performance and cost
it is a continuous tradeoff because you are going to have a criteria
whereas president kennedy didn't give us a cost he did give us a schedule and to a certain extent performance
but he didn't give us a cost
now as it turns out cost always becomes a factor
it always becomes a factor
but those were the things that really comprised you might say in simple minded terms systems engineering
i cannot emphasize those enough
now i don't know if that is how you visualize systems engineering or how everybody in the room visualizes systems engineering but that and the design process is really what systems engineering and design is all about
now whether we utilize that always in design of our projects i cannot say
i think we could have done a better upfront job in systems engineering on the shuttle
i really think we could have
i see things we could have done differently on the shuttle today if we really practiced a true systems engineering process
it is very difficult to do because you can stay in this systems engineering loop a long time and not get anything done
there is an old adage if you never get out of this loop you could do something do something and do something and never get anything done so you've got to be very careful with that
what is the role of systems engineering
technical customer interface requirements definition
requirements definition sound very very simple but requirements definition is probably one of the hardest things you have to do is to find out what the true requirements are
and unfortunately requirements do change as a function of time as you go through the phase of the program
but requirements definition is very very difficult to do and very important to come to grips with
as jr thompson talked to you i don't know if you recall jr's review of the shuttle main engine ssme
he said had they widened the throat a little bit they would have reduced the complexity of the design and development of the main engine
made it much more reliable but you would give up some performance
now why didn't we do that
because there was a requirement to advance technology
and i think jr made a very very important point there that those are things you need to look at early in the program
so requirements definition are very important extremely important
and it is very difficult to get to the bottom of it
requirements definition is a task in itself
and then of course there is a requirements management analysis and flow down audit
and then again you get interface management
risk management is becoming a big item today
you heard bob siemens talk and i didn't mention bob siemens
he is another very very important man in this whole era of apollo and down to shuttle
his role cannot be stated too highly
he did a fantastic job
his risk management was very interesting
i heard him talk not too long ago
and he said that the risk management in terms of cost and in terms of human life for the apollo program was accepted not only by the executive branch the legislative branch but the public
so risk management needs to be accepted
and that is one thing that is very very important
understand what the risk management is in terms of life in terms of cost and in terms of what it is going to do for you
so risk management is very important
and it is the function of the systems engineer to bring that to bear
performance management design process so forth and so on
technology need identifier
i had the reputation of not wanting to advance technology mainly because of budget constraints and i wanted to go with given technology
is that right
i don't know if that is right or not but the point being is that technology can drive a program
the fact that you have to develop the technology can drive the program
these are what the role of a systems engineering needs to do to figure out how they are going to handle technology if they are going to advance technology or not
what is a system
a system is a complete solution to a defined need in its full environment over the prescribed life
the system includes hardware software documentation human resources nonhuman resources esoteric factors
it includes almost everything you can think about
software turns out to be a big driver today
software in the system turns out to be one of the largest drivers
some of you asked me and i hope it helped what was the cost of the shuttle guidance and navigation system
i don't know who asked me for that
somebody asked me
was that helpful to you the number we gave you
the shuttle
they wanted to know the shuttle
but the fact is it didn't separate the cost of the software and the hardware
and the hardware came on pretty much on cost but the software was a lot higher
it was exponentially growing
software turns out to be i don't know jerry do you want to say a word on software
well the problems of software were the issues of validation verifying tests and retests
and then every once in a while somebody would come along and say well but we really ought to add this
and adding on was a killer
well as bill tenel used to say it is sort of the garbage dump for things you couldn't do in the hardware
the number that i remember is at some point when you wanted to change one line of code
ibm wanted dollars one million
each time for one line of code because they had to change the whole software so that is why they have the software control mode
that's right
i remember when i retired dave leestma who was head of the astronaut office at the time said that he thought he could get a change through
i forgot
it was something to do with return to launch site
i don't remember what it was but it was some kind of program he wanted to put in
he talked to everybody and they all approved it and it came to me and i turned it down
and he said at my retirement party now aaron is leaving maybe we can get it approved
but software changes do increase the cost of the program
a simple system example
space shuttle
your house
electronic calculator
freeway
the golden gate bridge
rapid transit
computers
a system really involves everything
almost everything you can think of is a system
the other thing that is interesting is this chart right here
you may have seen this charge before you've seen it different ways but the importance of systems engineering the systems engineering is doing the right thing right
as system increase in complexity and value early system decisions become increasingly important
it shows that actually in the impact of program funding when ten percents of the program funding is accomplished you have actually committed ninety percents of your dollars systems engineering systems have actually committed ninety percents of your dollars so that means early decision making on systems engineering
and whether you were going to make the engine throat wide or not actually impacts the program very heavily earlier
that is why systems engineering is so important
systems engineering is requirements in solution management
understanding analysis allocations so forth and so on which really affect performance cost and schedule
and there is the three legged stool again
this really says that if you remember certain parameters the continued tradeoff between cost schedule and performance is really one of the most important things you can understand that is really a systems engineering job
one thing i would like to talk about is the attributes of a systems engineering
systems engineers are very hard to come by
they really are very hard to come by and it is almost hard to tell you how to become one
i mean there are courses you can take but one thing i would suggest you do if you really want to be a systems engineer is you specialize in one technical area
whether it be structures whether it be thermodynamics heat transfer guidance and control control systems specialize in one area
that is the first step
you need to be competent and show your competency in one area but then you need to broaden out a little bit and look at how people actually operate
good judgment of technical competence in others
ability to build trust of team customer management
and this is what this course is about to work as a team and to have relationships with each other
i don't know if it was true at mit but many years ago in universities it was very bad to work as a team because you tended to rely on each other
and they wanted to have independent research independent development so students were not really encouraged to work as teams
i don't know if that is true at mit but it was certainly true at some universities i knew
i don't know
was it true
well we've gone through a major shift
and i think the rest of the country is as well from individual to team effort
yeah team effort
particularly in engineering
that's right
when i first went to a and m they thought it was terrible
some of the professors thought it was terrible working as teams
the difficult that all the top universities have is you guys are all admitted on the basis of your high school or i guess in graduate school your college grads so those are individual efforts that got you here
now we're saying put the emphasis on team activity
the japanese have traditionally done that far better than we have
that's right
i just wanted to strengthen what you said because a lot of people think that a systems engineer should be a jack of all trades and should know a little bit about everything
absolutely not true
you have to be very good in one specific area and that is your baseline
that's right
the most difficult thing in engineering as a manager is to make a decision when the guy who comes to you knows about the subject more than you because he is the expert
and the only way you can do it is by knowing how an expert behaves
and in your area of expertise you can make that judgment
some people are confused on this but i think that i one hundred percents agree with you
you have to be an expert in one field otherwise it won't work
i should say there have been a lot of discussions among the faculty in the aero astro department and perhaps in other departments as well as to when systems engineering should be taught
should it be taught at the undergraduate level
and right now the guiding philosophy in the aero astro department is to devote undergraduate time really to building up expertise in the individual subject matter as elliot said
the idea being that wait until you really have a good grounding as an engineer in one or more specific subjects and then at the graduate level that is time enough to actually look at systems engineering as a discipline so that you can draw on the expertise that you have built up
that is not a universally held decision
and there are people who make a good pedagogical case that you can actually start teaching principles of systems engineering right from the freshman level
and in the whole cdio philosophy that our department tries to follow we try to develop these principles which we think will then be useful as you get into more technical aspects of systems engineering levels
we always try to balance the technical expertise with the systems level thinking
yes jerry
i would like to point out that in the organizing teams a key important feature of that is to have that systems engineer who is organizing the team and setting up the meetings to know why and who should be attending
i attended a number of space station meetings when i had these product teams where every company in the world was there
and you had fifty people sitting around and there were only four who were real contributors and the others i could swear were falling asleep
you fundamentally have to have good management in team setups
well you're absolutely right
of course one of the problems with space station in all honesty if you had tried to devise a management system that was complex the space station system would have won because it is probably the most complex management system
in fact i tried to explain it to the bob gilruth one time who is another man i should have mentioned
he was the director of the johnson space center
and he came to see me and his eyes just rolled back in his head
he couldn't figure out what i was talking about
so you're right
but you know the other person that agrees with you elliot is chris kraft
chris kraft feels very strongly about becoming an expert in one field before you tackle something
self motivated
able to motivate others
in matrix management that becomes a good systems engineer if you're able to motivate others
methodical
analytical
intuitive
questioning
open minded
i think that is one of the key points being open minded
if you make a mistake be ready to accept the mistake and correct it and make a change to it
that is very important in systems engineering especially if you have to make some important decisions
confident
a good communicator
high level of integrity
so that is really some of my background on systems engineering
now let's talk a little bit about more how you go about doing it
thank you elliot
a system is generally considered a conglomeration of objects that perform a specific function
and you can think of those
i mean you can think of all those in the laptop computers you have many things like that which we talked about
and i mentioned this before
this is what i say
it is a postulate or whatever you want to call it
what is important for the whole system is nearly identical to what would be the best in the long run for each of its components
however what is best for each individual constituent may not be the best for the whole system
and so that really is something you need to keep in mind
that is really the postulate of systems engineering
it may be the right thing for the system but it may not be the right thing for the total configuration
and the systems engineering process is the customer user need analysis mission requirements functional analysis system concept development tradeoffs design
now this is systems engineering as it pertains to design
now there is systems engineering as it pertains to operations but this is systems engineering as it pertains to design
design optimization requirements flow down telecommunication design insurance verification audit and then you go through this iteration process
in fact this is what you do in your mind
i am sure you do that
when i taught this when i spoke about this to several professors my friends at texas a and m they say well there is nothing in this
they said it is all commonsense
and to a greater extent it is commonsense
but the problem is do you really practice it
do you really have a process in place and do you really practice it
and we find that we don't really practice it too well
and we say this over and over again
but the three factors of systems engineering will be the cost schedule and performance
and that is the famous three legged stool that we talked about many times
but that really is the essence
and you as an engineer going to work and getting paid that is what you're going to be paid for getting a product out the door that essentially meets the cost schedule and performance
you look quizzical
excuse me
no go ahead
the statistic that you gave
after ten percents of the project funding then you have ninety percents of your requirements defined do you think that function there might change today now that we have faster prototyping tools
it could change yes
this was done some time ago
technology is changing
rapid prototype is changing
cad design
a lot of things are changing
it might be not quite as dramatic you might say but it is still going to be there
a lot of your system engineering decisions are going to affect your end product very early in the game
and one reason why that ninety percents gets locked in is because of the difficulty of making changes once you've got all the plans drawn
that's right
and so to the extent that cad systems make it easier to change drawings and propagate changes throughout the system it may be that making certain changes are less expensive than they might have been
as jerry said about software you start changing your software around you've got to do re verification and so on
certainly to the degree that modern techniques might make things more flexible that number might get pushed down a little bit
but generally once you've gone through preliminary design review you have basically set the parameters of your project and things have a momentum and it really does get harder to change
and of course once you've gotten to the critical design review that's right
at that point you're starting to cut metal
and then once you've actually started to build something the price of changes goes up astronomically
when we did the apollo program we started in sixty one
it is my guess that by sixty four and not too far into sixty four i remember june of sixty four we had the implementation meetings with apollo
by that time all the hardware definition was in place
that's right
the program went on after that
and the only thing that kept growing or changing was software but the basic hardware picture was pretty much the nail was in in one thousand nine hundred sixty four three years into the program
well as jeff said once you start cutting chips and start cutting hardware it is pretty hard to make changes
if i could clarify
what exactly is it that is being locked in
well usually your requirements
primarily what your requirements are is the big driver
and then once your requirements are defined you can actually start your iterative process of design
once you get your functional performance requirements defined you then start your design iteration and you start locking into things and pretty quick you start cutting hardware and software
hopefully you have gotten a sense from all of the lectures on the subsystems of the shuttle the degree to which they interact with one another
that's a good point
i mean imagine if halfway down the road there had been a major change to the thermal protection system which had bumped the weight up by say twenty percents
imagine the ripples that that would have affected
or if somebody wanted to change the requirements for cross range after you had done the basic design of the system
let me give you a very real example in that
we had the wing basically designed
and you know that the landing gear comes up in the wing box
well we came to the conclusion that if you blew one tire on touchdown you could blow all the tires
and so what they wanted to do is increase the number of tires that went into the wheel well
and that was pretty late in the program
i mean we had already decided from the systems engineering point of view we were going to have the number of wheels we had and go up into the wheel well
but then came along a study that showed well if you blew one tire you're liable to lose the vehicle on touchdown
they wanted to go put more tires into that wheel well
well can you imagine what that would do
that would be redesigning the whole wing when the wing was built so we lived with that
we lived with that with some risk but you didn't make the change to it
that's the type of thing that gets into it
and i'm sure there are a number of items i could talk about that would cause that problem to occur
sometimes if you come up with a problem that really would be fatal you've got to change it
you've got to stop yeah
and one of the examples being the o ring seal on the solid booster
in retrospect people have said we should have changed that at the beginning
now who knows
if on one of the shuttle flights a tire had blown and we had lost the entire vehicle there would have been an accident investigation board
and they would have gone back and said we were flying with an untenable system
and we should have made that change
and that is where the engineer who has become a manager is really faced with a tough potentially life or death decision
and there is always an element of risk but if you try to take out all the elements of risk you will never fly
well that's absolutely right
and so how do you make that judgment
as i said that is why they pay you such a big salary
well the interesting part about that is after the challenger accident my deputy who became a very good friend of yours paul whites who was an astronaut a navy fighter pilot
and our job was to get the shuttle flying again after the challenger accident
i thought i brought it with me
we found this picture of a ship on a very ominous sea
it said a ship in the harbor is safe but that is not what ships are built for
you could make it so safe that you could never fly or you could never fly cross country or you could never take a train
you've got to use some judgment
and of course that risk today that risk level today is not very well accepted
a point i was trying to make is that during the apollo program it was accepted
we knew we had to take risk
tell me when you want to break jeff
do you want to break now
this is probably a good time
ok
we will take about a five minute break
i want to get to cost but i have got a few more things to say
let me talk about process
we had a contract with ford motor company and i showed this to ford motor company of a design process i would go through
and they said that is very interesting we studied for a long time and this is exactly what we use to understand the need
and the need was not the ford edsel
that was not a good needs statement
but you need a need you need a need analysis
well i tell you
you need to talk to henry pohl
henry pohl who heard lecture still has an edsel
henry is probably one of the few people that still has an edsel in his garage
henry has a lot of things like that but henry still has an edsel
but you need to do a need analysis understand what the need means
you need a function structure
and actually in some of your reports i saw very good examples of all these
now maybe not in all the reports but i saw somebody talking about the needs somebody talking about needs analysis somebody talking about function structure requirements
the hardest thing for engineers to do especially young engineers to do is to make some assumptions and constraints and do some preliminary calculations
it is very difficult for them to do that
they like to see f ma
and i once mentioned that to joe shea and he said i am glad you were still on your formula when i talked about f ma
you need some calculations and then you need to do some conceptual designs
and that really is you might say the design process
and you can use various forms of it but that is probably the best form of it you can think about
systems engineering
interdisciplinary activities
customer need
functional identification requirements
iterative design process with reviews at various stages
conceptual preliminary and final designs
and that is what professor hoffman was talking about
as you go downstream very quickly on that it becomes harder and harder and harder to make changes
let me now stop with systems engineering not that i couldn't go longer
but let me stop with systems engineering and talk to you about a subject you're probably having more problems with than anything and that is how you do a cost analysis
and unfortunately i am not going to give you a closed form solution for it
there is none
not only that i did the ninety day study when president bush was president
i stood on the steps of the smithsonian
dick truly appointed me to do it
and that study was really paned by everything
because they said give us a cost analysis
and i really thought they wanted to know what it was going to cost so i told them
well they didn't like it
and in all honesty i really wasn't that high because it was a thirty year project
i gave them the cost for a thirty year project actually building launch vehicles technology
but nevertheless i had my day in the barrel on cost analysis
let me talk a little bit about cost estimation techniques
it turns out some of you were trying to use it
here are the cost estimating techniques
expert interview
you talk to an expert in the field if you can find one
parametric analysis
i am going to spend most of my time talking about parametric cost analysis because i think that is the one that pertains to an engineering design course
parametrics
because it is in terms that you understand weight performance that type of thing
i am going to talk about that
analogies
and then the engineering which is really you might say the grassroots or the buildup of what it is going to cost for engineering hours manufacturing hours and that type of thing which is pretty hard to do
i am going to go through those
now some of you have tried to do some of these
some of you have tried to call contractors to find out what a particular thing was going to cost
some of you have tried to find out what the shuttle guidance and navigation system cost
you were trying to do it but it's not easy to come by
you call a vendor and he says well he will quote you but he wants to know what you're going to use it for
it is hard to do
i know it is very very hard to do
and they want to know how many hundred you are going to buy
i don't minimize the job you have in trying to do a cost estimate but you've got to recognize that as an engineer and you go out and start to work they are going to want to know what this thing is going to cost you and what allies you have to make
now these are the cost estimating techniques over the project cycles
you can see as the project goes along you have this so called parametric method analogies judgments system level cers cost estimate relationships
and that is a very key thing cost estimate relationships
i am going to talk more about that but let me tell you what a cost estimate relationship in a very simple minded approach is
let's say you're going to go buy a house
what is the first thing you want to know about buying a house
how many square feet do you have right
you take how many square feet you're going to have and you usually know about what it cost per square foot in the area you want to buy a house in
you multiply that and you get a rough estimate of the house
now there is another factor that goes into that
there is the culture
where you are going to build this house is going to affect the cost per square foot
if you build it in a very expensive neighborhood i always give the relationship in houston because i know houston
if you're going to build it in clear lake where nasa is it is one culture
if you build it in river oaks where the very wealth oil people it is another culture
the cost per square foot in clear lake is much lower than the cost per square foot in clear lake
you can get a rough estimate but that is a very simple minded cer
it is a cost estimate relationship
they become very very complicated when you talk about past history when you talk about weight of spacecraft and so forth and so on
i will develop a little bit of that
general subsystem cers and calibrated system cers
but these are the parametric methods
and you can see where they are used analogies and judgment
and they are used for a certain period of time
then when you get to the phase b or cd you talk about component buildup estimates detailed estimates and vendor quotes
that is sort of the schedule
and this was provided by the cost technology over the project cycles by the lunar and mars exploration office
that goes way back
it has abolished and now restored again
so that is the cycle you go through
and of course you're in really the phase a so it is going to be pretty hard for you to do the direct methods
even though you might try it is going to be pretty hard for you to do that
you almost have to use some type of a parametrics
and i am going to talk about how you do a parametric
i am going to talk to you about how you do both of them
and this can get you into more trouble
cost estimates get you in a lot of trouble
how many in here are familiar with what we call a work breakdown structure
ok good
work breakdown structure is really the management tool that is needed in doing a project
whenever you get a project you form a work breakdown structure which is a hierarchical breakdown the work necessary to complete a project
work breakdown structure elements should be identified by title by numbering system that performs the following functions
it identifies the level of the breakdown structure element it identifies the higher level to which the breakdown structure would be integrated and shows the cost
that is the key thing
it shows the cost account number of the element and how much it costs how much labor hours is going to take
that is a very very important tool
in fact when you go out and work in industry actually if you become a member of a work breakdown structure you're graded on how well you perform under this work breakdown structure
that is the tool they grade you on
we will put these charts on the internet
roll of the work breakdown structure
project and technical planning and scheduling
cost estimating and budget formulation
project status reporting and plans such as specifications and drawings
now those that raised their hands where did you learn to do work breakdown structure
can anybody answer me
where did you learn to do that those that said you were familiar with it
yes sir
i learned it here at mit
did you
very good
they taught you
that's very good
what course was it
it is not a course
it is my research
oh your research
did you find it hard to do
i found it initially difficult but once i realized how to work it i definitely saw the benefits of that approach
very good
well it is an important tool that you need to do
and that is why it is probably a little hard for you to do cost estimation because you are not used to some of these things you need to do to get the cost done
well some of the basic elements of cost estimation is understand the product develop a detailed work breakdown structure
did you do that for this project
no
that is ok
i didn't mean to put you under the gun
understand the development of the culture
understand the culture
it turns out the nasa culture is pretty high level because it does involve risk
and i will give you a little story about
somebody asked von braun one time why nasa had to gold plate everything
he said because you made it out of pure gold it would cost too much
it is not that they gold plate everything but it is that you really have a life concern in a very hostile environment
you have to understand the development culture
gather data from close analogs develop the cost estimate relationships
there are textbooks that show you how to develop cers
there is a large society called parametric cost analysis
and in that you can get how to develop cers
i am not suggesting you necessarily do that because it is very very time consuming but just know that they do exist
there are by the way very sophisticated computer programs which i want to talk about that develop the cers for you based on inputs you give them
these programs are very expensive
one is called price
i will show you what the other one is
and it was actually developed by rca
it now is owned by the martin company
or was owned by the martin company
group cers according to the work breakdown structure
and you need to quantify the risk and the method
estimate the cost spread the cost and do a reality check
those are some of the things you need to do
now understanding the costing and the analysis process as i said you need to understand the project participate in the design team activities
scoping inheritance and complexity
identification of content schedule and goals
collecting cost estimating inputs by weight statements technical characteristics preparing the estimates cers translating labor hours and dollar hours
and this is a lot of details that you are not going to have time to do but you do need to understand the complexity that doing cost analysis entails
it is very very difficult and very hard to do
and you have groups set up to do that
but on the other hand engineers working on a project are going to be called upon to do it because you are the best source of information that they have to do it
here is the basic building block of the parametric cost estimating is the relationship of the cost estimating relationship
and the dependent value variable is cost
the independent variable is something that you can understand
it is weight power isp and so forth
they are specific engineering terms
and there is some relationship between weight certainly for structures there is certainly a value based on historical data points of weight of the structure the type of materials and so forth on the cer the cost relationship
so that is how it is developed
a lot of students had a very difficult time using this program because they didn't know how the cers were developed
it frustrated them because here was this magic program that calculated the cers for them
right josh
josh is one of my students
and they had a very difficult time trying to understand how to use the program because they couldn't understand how to do the cers
but there is a methodology in it
and there are many books that explain it
the other thing that is important as i pointed out is the cultural variable
the cultural variable is this
see this is one unit dry weight
and it can show us the total cost but it can show that for aircraft you're on one culture plane on an unmanned spacecraft you're on another cultural plane on manned spacecraft you're on another cultural plane and on a planetary spacecraft you're on another cultural plane
that is a very big issue
one of the issues with nasa they say to get the cost down for nasa is you need to change the cultural plane
of course if you change the cultural plane you probably have to give up something
you probably would give up some risk in terms of safety or margin
so you have got to recognize that the cultural variable is a very strong indicator
are you happy to note that the aircraft is so low and everybody flies on an airplane but that is the cultural variable that it shows
for a structure you can see how the structure varies based on the cultural plane
when you were talking about like using square footage as a rough estimate for a house and in the space business we do use weight as kind of a substitute
you can translate from weight into cost
and yet people always point out well yeah but a kilogram of aluminum structure costs a lot less than a kilogram of computer chips
but nevertheless when you put everything down when you're designing a planetary spacecraft they do have these estimated relationships
if you're going to have a project which lands one hundred fifty kilograms on mars compared to a ton on mars we do have these relationships
because in general we figure that the ratio of hardware and software and computer chips to aluminum and all that is roughly similar
but if you are going to try to build something that is fundamentally new which involves a lot of new technology then of course you can go way off of these rough estimates
to get a good understanding you might say a very quick understanding you might go to the nasa website and get parametric cost analysis
it will give you a very good understanding of what you can get
and you can get some of these programs off the internet today
they are not very sophisticated but they do have some cer relationships as jeff was talking about
it might be a little bit more difficult for some of the items
structures would be an easy item to do but unfortunately i don't think anybody is doing that
but it would even be good for the avionics system i think in life support
yes
are these software packages basically just a large database
they are basically a large database that you put in the data
in fact they are so sophisticated now you can put in the software the type of software you are using the number of lines of code and based on the cer for that particular subject it can tell you how much it is going to cost per line of code
it is very very sophisticated
and nasa uses it quite a bit
yes
with this software you must have to update it very very frequently because of technology changes
they update it very frequently
that's right
and that is why they are so expensive
they are very expensive but they update them
for example i started using it at a and m and they didn't have even a software package in there for composites
now they have one for composites
and there are a lot of these which are proprietary and you cannot even get access to them
i mean the aerospace corporation has compiled a huge database of costs of a lot of components historical to how much it was estimated how much it actually cost
and so nasa and the dod often go to aerospace to do cost analysis for them
and of course aerospace charges
and they don't release their database because it is proprietary
knowledge is power and money in this situation
they put a lot of work into putting the database together
yes
were you able to try to use it
did you try to check it out
and of course it may not have the update as this gentleman was talking about but it has a certain amount
you could do a pretty quick analysis
i would suggest you try to do that because i know that i had looked at it and there are ways to do it
now you've got to be careful of the results because sometimes the results become pretty high
but you've got to be careful of the results and look at it pretty carefully
this is another development of cost scaling law
this happens to be weight versus you can see the two different cultural planes known cost and weight unknown cost from a given weight
this is basically how they generate the cers
it is a process
it isn't an analytical process but there also is a lot of empirical data that goes with it
and as jeff said it is based on a large database
now cost estimation i am telling you hard it is to do and you probably already know it
but for a cost estimation now this is after you get over the errors of parametric cost analysis
now we're talking about how you do a cost analysis when you're really trying to figure how you go forward to ask for a budget
you need fairly detailed information
it is unrealistic for designers to give cost information for conceptualist designs but designers must be able to make rough cost estimates
that is what i am saying that you do need to be able to make rough cost estimates
now if you are trying to make a detailed cost estimate and that goes back to the work breakdown structure you need the number of labor hours and number of people on the project
i mean people is probably going to be the most expensive
you need the number of labor hours the number of people on the project
during the shuttle program orbiter project manager i used to call my counterpart at rockwell every saturday morning
and we would go through how many people we had on each work breakdown structure for each contractor
we would talk about it to be sure we had the budget to cover it
and then of course we had to be sure we got the product out the door
but the number of labor hours the number of people on the project the length of time these people are going to be on it the overhead rates office space computer benefits cost per hour of a person basically is what you are looking for that is how you really do a cost estimate
and of course it is going to vary depending on the locale of the contractor
what are the cost drivers
now here is where the cost comes out some of the things that doctor hoffman was talking about
the errors in the design
change in requirements
core interface definition
technology development
poor communication
poor teamwork
these are all elements of systems engineering that have gone awry that have not gone in the right direction
but this is what caused the cost to go up
in my experience the biggest problem in cost estimates have been the changes in requirements
that is really the thing that has caused most of the problems
that is why you need really good definition requirements and not change it
technology development that can cost you a lot of money and sometimes you have to go forward with it
now this is old data
this is one thousand nine hundred ninety three data but i got this from a contractor a long time ago
first of all what you need to do and of course it is a lot different i don't know if it is higher or lower today with cad systems this was before they really used cad systems but this the average cost of an engineering drawing
and it goes through how you do it
it is probably the labor rates are higher today
the average hours per drawing are probably lower
but this says in one thousand nine hundred ninety three the rate is an estimate for one thousand nine hundred ninety three government year of about dollars three point zero in average drawing so you have to figure out how many drawings you need
i mean that is a good way to understand the cost estimate of what it is going to be
you need to know how many drawings you need and you need an understanding of the cost settlement
the elements of cost during manufacturing then are the number and complexity of the drawings cost of a drawing number and complexity of machine and fabricated parts and what the parts are made out of
aluminum steel titanium nickel inconel and so forth because some are more complicated to machine than others
but some are used in the space program some are not
titanium was becoming more and more important
other things of manufacturing are tolerance of parts
it turns out engineers tend to you might say put extra tolerances on parts that they don't need
and that can cause parts to be very very expensive
the finish of parts the quality of parts assembly complexity and time qualification of checking a test
i remember my first day at work when i worked for rca i was designing a microwave tube magnetron
i was a terrible draftsman as a matter of fact
that was a long time ago
i would probably be better with cad systems
but i sent out this part to the shop
and this guy coming in showing this stogy out in the machine shop
at that time we sat in these big bullpens each person at a desk and i had my name on my desk
he comes in this big room and says where the hell is cohen
that is me
he said this is the dumbest drawing i have ever seen in my life
how do you expect anybody to make this part
so you have to be sure you understand what you are doing
it turns out i learned to work with that guy and became good friends
that never happened again but he wanted to know where the hell was this cohen who put out this dumb drawing
he said there is no way i can make this part
and that was a small part but you need to understand the complexity of the part and what you're putting out to the shop
but today they have checks and balances
and with the cad systems i am not even sure this is accurate anymore
this about brings me to the close of what i wanted to talk to you about but let me just give you one final chart
and then i would like you to ask some questions about anything i talked about or anything anybody else covered that you heard about
i would stress that for you today in your course is to try to use parametric cost analysis
that is what i would think you should do
at least that is what i think you ought to do
and i think you can get information off the internet that will allow you to do something
now it may not pertain to all projects
i am not saying you have to do it but it might be the thing to do
it is going to be very difficult
doing the right thing by creating a work breakdown structure in trying to do that it is going to be very difficult for you to do it in this course
but the parametric approach to cost hardware costs are not produced from parts less than labor tables so you don't need that
they are produced from general measures of the impact of such items costs and in preparing inexpensive and more realistic and manageable costs based on cost estimating relationships
you might want to do some reading on cost estimating relationships and there are a lot of references to that just to be sure you understand what i am talking about and what they are so it is not a complete mystery to you so you get a better feel for what it is
a lot of textbooks have cost estimating relationships
cers make use of characteristics that can be readily quantifiable such as weight size and to estimate variables that are difficult to quantify such as cost and production schedules
as i said parametric models can range from a simple arithmetical relationship to a sophisticated computerized model so they can be very very complicated or very simple
and i suggest you try to do that
let me just show you what the programs are not that you will be able to get them but when you get out of industry if i can find them here
well it may not happen
there is certainly a lot of information
here is the price model
that is price h
and you can actually do structural weight material types tolerances
you can actually do electronics digital analog technology
so you do have quite a bit of latitude of what you do
now you're probably not going to get that program here because it is pretty expensive and pretty hard to do
but when you go out in industry or government there is a very high probability you will be using some of these programs
and johnson space center uses this one and the marshall space flight center uses this one crh
there are two programs that are used by nasa i know and they are becoming more and more important as we go ahead
aaron one thing you haven't discussed in all this discussion of cost is margin
and as a manager you have to deal with that so maybe you can make a few comments on that
sure
well let me start off this way
what professor hoffman is alluding to is that when you create a budget you want to have some type of reserve or margin over and above your cost estimate
and that takes care of several things
it takes care of changes it takes care of i forgots and it takes care of inefficiencies
studies have found that in a high technology program for the first time you are about thirty percents inefficient so you are only about seventy percents efficient
now this was data that was taken some time ago
you are seventy percents efficient so you need to allow some type of margin in that for your inefficiencies
if you do that and you talk about changes and you talk about i forgots your reserve becomes very high
and normally your boss the guy that is over you is not going to let you have that much money
one of the investigations we had on me during the shuttle program because my cost was growing a very famous man came in to be head of the program named general abrahamson
many of you may have heard of general abrahamson
while he did the investigation he said aaron you need a large reserve
he didn't know he was going to become manager of the program
when he became manager of the program i had this large reserve in there he was reviewing and said you cannot have that much reserve so he wacked it down
but you do need a reserve because you're not going to make it without a reserve
and i don't know if you noticed or not but in the papers i gave you on the cost of the shuttle system it had about a thirty percents reserve in there
when i did the study for the ninety day study i had a fifty percents reserve in there because i felt that was a pretty far out program and you needed a reserve
you need to fight for your reserve but i guaranty you're not going to get everything you think you need
yes sir
for something like aerospace every time you do a cost estimate they talk about it look at it and say well let's increase that by fifty percents or double it
and often even once you've done that you still don't come under budget
i mean look at the iss or the airbus three hundred eighty that is going out
why
well again it is really because first of all it is primarily for the inefficiencies
you just cannot do a high tech program
look at what it cost to do the big dig to drive it home
it is very difficult to do a good cost estimate but that is the problem that congress sees with government programs today both the department of defense and nasa that they cannot do a good cost estimate
the current program says they are going to do the ceving and go to the moon for dollars one hundred four billion which is fifty five percents of what it cost to do the apollo program in current year dollars
and that is going to be interesting to see if they can do it
it is tough to do
but really i think the biggest problem is your inefficiencies
of course there are changes and i forgots
interesting enough though you may or may not believe this and you probably won't but i will say it anyway it turns out that the studies done for the shuttle program for the orbiter actually in real year dollars met the cost if we would have gotten the inflation rate
we lost the inflation for two years which dale myers fought for vigorously with omb
if we would have gotten the inflation for those two years we would have met cost for the development cost
not for the operational cost but for the development cost we would have come pretty close to it
we didn't really miss it that far
in apollo i'm not sure you would need to ask doctor siemens but the story goes is that nasa came in with an estimate
and at that time the administrator webb looked at it and said that is fine and he doubled it and so apollo did very well
i think bob siemens has told that
the story we heard was it was on their way over to the white house that he said our final estimate we've put all the factors and everything in is dollars ten billion
and webb said ok we will tell the president dollars twenty billion
i am sure bob siemens would know
yes sir
aaron i wanted to ask you about the location of the reserves
not just dollar reserves but my experience as a payload
the model i have been faced with is that the mission manager has a reserve for crew time or for weight of something but down on the project level you would really like to go and have your own
and so there was a tendency for everybody but the lowest level from the individual experiment up to say well i am going to put in a little bit of pad rather than count on the fact that i can go up to the mission manager and ask him for some reserve later
well that is the danger with that
you are absolutely right
everybody would like to put their own reserve in
of course being a project manager i thought the reserve ought to be at my level
but actually john yardley was my boss in washington and he thought he should handle the reserve
and the subsystems managers wanted their reserve right
wanted their reserve
and john yardley was another person i should have mentioned
john actually basically pulled the reserve up and handled it in washington
there is a certain efficiency i assume in having all the reserves centralized so that there is not a lot of waste down to lower levels but you have to have the confidence that you are going to be able to draw on it
right
and with that john would partial out some
what he would do is be sure that you weren't double reserving him or triple reserving him
and then he would allocate it to me
i know he had a rule of thumb
when jr thompson went up you heard jr talk he always asked for more than he needed so john would give him less
when i went up i always asked for less than i needed so he would give me more
he had a good feel for his managers
that is what he told jr one day
normally you wind up handling it
if you have a good program manager at the top you normally wind up handling it there and he parcels it out based on the fact there is no double bookkeeping
yes
my experience at draper is typically there are two different ways of estimating
one was called top down and the other was bottoms up
and traditionally bottoms up would always stick their reserve in some way and top down would always say i want to know what your reserves are because i want to bring it up to the top
and that was a constant argument
then when you got to submitting your proposal often the customer didn't want to know about this extra money and then you would have to shove it back in and hide it in a sense by padding things
handling costing in reserves is to some extent at least in my experience a psychological thing dealing with customers and your management
and it has always been one where you shuffle that reserve around
but this gentleman asked the question about why does it appear that nasa never can stay on their budget
that is really a tough question to answer
i don't know
i mean i have a personal feeling on it but i think the basic problem you have is that it is a high technology program
it is one of a kind and it is a lot of inefficiencies
when you come to work every day you don't know exactly what you are going to do
you have a technology development that costs
you have i forgots
you have changing requirements
changing requirements are something that systems engineering ought to be able to control
i forgots are something systems engineering ought to be able to control
inefficiencies to a certain extent systems engineering ought to be able to control
that is one of the purposes in all honesty that are concentrating on system engineering at such places at mit and other schools to allow the future generation of designers and developers in working that they can have a budget and then stay on the budget
maybe in your generation you will be smarter and able to control it but it is not going to be an easy job
that is one thing i would say
let me just make one other comment
we cannot estimate too much
that you've got to always keep in mind this triangle of cost performance schedule
if you are working on a project where the schedule is fixed like apollo then that better ring the bells to say that i need more reserves
and maybe that is what was going on in jim webb's mind when he said if we really have to get this done by the end of the decade i better make sure that i am not going to be constrained by cost and so i will double it
the other thing that you have to take into account with the performance is how much new technology is this program going to require
because the new technology that is the hardest thing to estimate the cost
that's right
and so if you have a new technology program then your margins better be big enough to accommodate that
that is why for the cev they are really going out of their way to saying to the maximum extent possible we don't want to develop new technology for the cev
we want to use shuttle parts wherever we can apollo heritage
we want to build it out of things that we know and we understand so that we hopefully can keep the cost as low as possible
and we will see how it all works out
yes sir
it seems to me that you often times have the pressure to give a cost estimate on the low end of what you believe it to actual be just so the project might be more appealing
that is certainly another part of the whole political thing
and not just from the political point of view of presenting your estimate when nasa presents the estimate to congress but then you have the contractors who want to get the contract from nasa
and you have certainly had experience with this
how do you deal with the contractor who low balls and then assumes that they will be able to make it up later on
low balling really should not be tolerated
and they try to do that not tolerating it but you are absolutely right
when i did this ninety day study i really felt they wanted to know what it was going to cost
so i had a fifty five percents reserve in there because i really felt that there were so many unknowns with it
and of course that didn't go over very well
they said my study actually killed the projects
but i told them what it was going to cost
and then this is a subject for another lecture entirely which i am not sure that we are going to do in this course but there are many different ways to let out contracts fixed price contracts cost plus contracts award contracts
and all of those can have an impact on the ultimate cost of your project
and they all have their utility depending on how well the technology is known and what is the time pressure
again cost performance schedule
and you asked about airbus
i don't know the specifics of airbus contracting but i am familiar with esa
and because of some of the peculiarities of the european system they tend to use fixed price contracts a lot more than we do here
and sometimes it works but sometimes you get really burned on it because contractors are not going to go into bankruptcy because they cannot deliver on their fixed price contracts
you try to go fixed price on the cev and it would cost you a fortune
those are very good questions
unfortunately we don't give you very firm answers on cost
but at least you are thinking and i appreciate your thought process
it is very encouraging to hear you ask those types of questions
have a good weekend
welcome everyone to sixteen point eight hundred eighty five
and i guess this is esd thirty five as well
i think
i cannot keep track of the number
formally the title is aircraft systems engineering
i never thought i would actually be teaching a course with aircraft in the title of it since i am not an airplane person i am a space person
but as you all know we have decided to devote the course this year to a study of the space shuttle
very briefly what the course has been historically it was taught for quite a few years by professors murman and hansman in the aero astro department
it is a course in systems engineering devoted to aircraft systems
and what they typically would do would be to have a series of lectures about principles of systems engineering and also about various systems general systems in aviation
and then as a class assignment the students would work in teams and choose an aircraft and do a systems analysis study of that aircraft
well a couple of years ago we were just sort of sitting down and chatting
and someone brought up the idea that well you know the space shuttle kind of is like an airplane
maybe it would be interesting to devote the course one year to a special study of the space shuttle
and that was actually the origin of what we are doing this year
following that professor aaron cohen who is sitting over here and i will introduce him in more detail in a minute visited mit i think it was early last year and gave a few lectures on systems engineering and the development of the space shuttle
and we started talking about putting together a course on the shuttle
and we were very fortunate now that this fall professor cohen is here as a visiting professor
and he will be here at mit roughly about half the time
and he and i have put this course together
and the way we are going to organize it is that we're going to emphasize two main areas
first of all to get to an understanding of the space shuttle as a flying machine as a spacecraft and also to study systems engineering as an engineering discipline
we have put together a list of speakers and i am going to pass out here copies of the syllabus
if you will pass these around
i have also established a stellar class website and once you are all enrolled in the course you will all have access to the website
if any of you are here as listeners or for some other reason don't get formally registered to get course access contact me independently and we can set you up for a special access so that you can look on the website
if you look through here you will see that most of the class periods are devoted to guest lecturers
and thanks in large part to professor cohen we have actually been able to invite people who played pivotal roles in the very early stages of the design of the space shuttle
and also people who played pivotal roles in the testing and eventual operation of the shuttle
so we have people who are active in the design and also some people who were critical in mission control and in the test flights of the shuttle
it is i think a really unique collection of speakers
and because i don't think there has ever been a time where this sort of a collection of people has actually come together to share their experiences on the shuttle
and because we thought that it would have historical significance and people would be interested in being able to look at that in the future we are having the lecture series taped for eventual inclusion on mit's opencourseware
so that is why you see the television camera in the back
no need for all of you to dress up for it but just so that you know
the way we plan to run the course is as follows
the lectures will run roughly about an hour we will take a little break at the end of an hour and then there will be an opportunity basically for close interaction between you in the class and the lecturer
it is kind of free form because we have lots of different lectures
of course there will be some variability in the way lecturers go about presenting the material
professor cohen and i will attempt to make sure that in each case we do emphasize some of the basic systems engineering aspects of the presentation
we want you to understand the principles of how some of the different subsystems were designed basically how they were influenced by external requirements to make sure that we understand what the requirements were how the systems were constructed and tested and how they were operated
what we will be asking from you in terms of your deliverables first of all we would like you to take notes on the lectures
we will post the lecture notes on the website
if you look through the schedule that i have given you here you will see that i list the deliverables and i am going to have to adjust the timing on that
two times in the course we will ask to see the lecture journals
what we are looking for is to make sure that we are presenting and that you are getting out of this the basic systems engineering principles for each of the subsystems that are presented
and we will talk a little bit about journal notes in the future
the main deliverable from you will be a little bit different from in the normal aircraft systems engineering course where groups of students basically chose and airplane and then looked at the design of that particular airplane
we are only dealing with one vehicle the shuttle so what we will be asking you to do is choose one of the subsystems on the shuttle
and as you look through the notes you see we will have information presented on a lot of the different subsystems
i have a lot of material available and i will go over that a little bit later both in digital form and in books which we will have on reserve at the library which go into great detail on all the different subsystems
so we have lots of information as well as experts that you can talk with
we will ask you to form up into teams roughly four people on a team more or less
choose a subsystem
and then basically write a paper on how you would design that subsystem if you were doing it today using twenty one st century technology
it gives you an opportunity to understand the subsystem as it was designed for the shuttle and then to take a look at current technology in that subsystem
i know there are some people here from engineering systems as well as from aero astro
people may have some other ideas
if you have some ideas about writing about systems from a systems engineering and integration point of view or any other particular personal ideas of what you would like to do as a project which is slightly different from specifically working with a subsystem come see me and we will talk about it
the main thing is to make sure that you have a chance to explore some aspect of the systems engineering of the shuttle in greater depth
that is all i am going to say right now
go to the website
i will be posting more information because i want to give as much time as possible to our two speakers
i by the way will be posting bios of all the speakers on the website so you will be able to look ahead of time and get an idea of who it is who will be speaking to us and what their roles were in the development or testing or operation of the shuttle
so i would like to present now professor aaron cohen who was born in texas and has had a very distinguished career at nasa
just very briefly he was the project manager i guess first in apollo he was the command and service module project manager
and then he was the project manager for the space shuttle and eventually became the center director of the johnson space center in houston
when he retired in the early ninety s he took a teaching position at texas a and m in the mechanical engineering department where he is now professor emeritus
and we are extremely fortunate to have him here co teaching the course with me
so aaron i will turn it over
thank you very much
and it is a pleasure to be here with you
i have a few things i would like to talk to you about very briefly and then i will turn it over to our guest speaker today
i would like to let you know what you can expect for the next several lectures
i am going to provide you with the overall shuttle how the shuttle works the requirements of the shuttle the design and the development of the subsystems to a certain extent to give you an overall view of the shuttle so you will have a background of information when you later start to hear the detailed lectures of the subsystems in some degree
as you listen to these various technical lectures you should be prepared to figure out what system you are really interested in and what system you would like to move forward with in your future talks
and so you will see that
so that is what i will do in the next two lectures tuesday and thursday
in trying to figure out how we start the course i went back in my memory to figure out a man who was there at the very beginning in washington
and this man mister dale myers who is going to talk today is what you might say is a true aerospace engineer
he had a very distinguished career in both industry and government in aircraft and space
dale or mister myers who was deputy administrator at nasa from october one thousand nine hundred eighty six to one thousand nine hundred eighty nine and that was when president regan called dale myers back to be deputy administrator after the challenger accident
mister myers was corporate vice president of rockwell international president of the north american aircraft group where he was responsible for the b one and various military and commercial aircraft
in one thousand nine hundred seventy he has been an associate with rockwell international and vice president and manager for the apollo command and service module
so he was apollo and shuttle
the key thing that mister myers is going to talk to you about today he was the nasa associate administrator for manned space flight in one thousand nine hundred seventy when the space shuttle began
and mister myers is going to talk to you about the beginning of the space shuttle and how the external environment helped create or generate requirements that really forced you might say the configuration of the shuttle
and i think it is very important for you to understand that because many times when you get out and start to work go to work the requirements become generated by external environments
so without further ado let me turn the speaker over to dale myers to give you his lecture
well thanks for the opportunity to talk to you guys about a very interesting historical element
i was asked to talk about the origin of the shuttle
and i was there in one thousand nine hundred seventy
and i think once we get this thing working where i can run the slides the joy of electronics
when i first went to work for north american aviation we used marchant calculators where you put in your numbers and pull a lever and actually move it to the next position
and we did a lot of dynamic analysis
and it took weeks to do a total dynamic flight analysis of an aircraft with a marchant calculator
now we have the wonders of the computer
the first airplane i worked on was a p fifty one mustang a fighter in world war ii and that had some interesting system engineering issues in it too
they used the inlet it had a liquid cooled engine and we had a radiator that was in a duct
and the air came through the radiator cooled the liquid and heated up the air that was then properly adjusted with a flap at the back of the radiator that gave it thrust out of the heat that was involved coming through the radiator
that is the reason why the mustang is about fifteen miles an hour faster than the german's me one hundred nine
that is one of the prettiest pictures i have ever seen of the shuttle
that is a picture of the additional photography that they brought into the system after the columbia accident and this was used on this last flight
the first time i had ever seen the rearview of all the connections for the transfer of fuel from the tank into the shuttle the connections to the tank the forward bipod where the foam was that came off on the columbia accident just a terrific picture of all the tiles up under the wing that aaron was so involved with
but what i want to talk about oh here is another one that is really a first for me
this is the mach one shock on the shuttle about twenty thousand feet altitude mach one point one
that big envelope of condensation not as pretty as it looks on an f eighteen or some really slick airplane but it is there
i am going to talk about what happened leading up to the shuttle
and it is interesting because it involves the specific interests and personalities of the people who were involved
jim webb was the administrator of nasa from one thousand nine hundred sixty one to one thousand nine hundred sixty eight and he was a terrific interactor with the rest of the administration and with the president directly
and did a great job of administrating nasa through the apollo program up through one thousand nine hundred sixty eight
it turned out in one thousand nine hundred sixty eight things were kind of going sour for president johnson
webb's big tie was with president johnson and he ended up leaving in one thousand nine hundred sixty eight after he suggested to president johnson that he might want to leave some time soon
i think he was thinking he was going to stay through the lunar landing but johnson said why don't you leave now
and i don't really understand the interaction that was involved there but webb did not want to make future plans
he really never paid much attention to the work that was being done inside the system on new ideas new things beyond apollo
of course the apollo was an immense program four hundred thousand people
well three hundred thousand on the apollo another one hundred thousand on other activities in nasa like the aeronautics program and the science programs
but webb didn't want to talk about things that were going to happen beyond that time period
in the meantime in the back rooms a lot of people were doing a lot of thinking about where does nasa go after the apollo program
apollo at that time that webb was there had planned to go through apollo twenty i think
and so it was going to go on until one thousand nine hundred seventy three or so
and so i think webb took the attitude that we don't need to think about the future yet
well when he left in one thousand nine hundred sixty eight they brought in a fellow named tom paine who had been at general electric company doing advanced planning for general electric a very bright very aggressively forward thinking guy
a guy that i always felt never saw a future plan he didn't like
and nasa was doing a fantastic amount of future planning at that time because in the one thousand nine hundred sixty eight time period we had just done the apollo seven gotten it back into flight again
at the end of sixty eight we did the apollo eight which went around the moon and nasa could do no wrong at that time
they were just on a step
and with tom coming in in early sixty nine all the work that was being done by nasa at that time the idea was that the nasa programs were going to continue to grow and that you could really begin to do some expansive thinking about going out into space
there had been work going on since one thousand nine hundred sixty four on lifting bodies and on different configurations that people imagined could be used for traveling in space and returning to the ground in a more sophisticated manner than coming down on parachutes in the water
water landings were extremely expensive having the whole navy out there to support them and so people were beginning to think about land landing
and by one thousand nine hundred sixty nine enough pressure came on the administration that nixon appointed his vice president spiro agnew to run a program reviewing the future of nasa
and he got a really good group of people together
he got bob seamans i am sure you all know
tom paine the administrator of nasa lee dubridge had been head of caltech and was the science advisor to the president
they had a guy that was the head of the atomic energy commission and the head of the bureau of the budget
they did about a six month study supported by nasa
and nasa's dreams were that there should be a space transportation system that would include the moon and finally mars
and it started with a thirty foot diameter twelve man space station two of them in earth orbit possibly reaching one hundred people in earth orbit
another space station the same size around the moon with twelve men
a lunar base
a nuclear stage to transfer resources from earth orbit space stations to the lunar orbit space station
a two stage fully recoverable shuttle with one hundred to one hundred fifty flights a year because of this massive program that was being developed
a skylab with five visits by the command module
this by the way was a second skylab
skylab was in our program and a second skylab was under construction at that time in this time period
and of course to do all this we would continue the saturn one b and the saturn v production
those were the big rockets involved in the apollo program
and space tug to go to higher than low earth orbit to geosynchronous
and as i mentioned the nuclear stage
and a mars program by one thousand nine hundred eighty three
that was all presented to this group and they ended up setting up three different programs
one was this massive all inclusive program
a second one was a program where the space shuttle would be built and the plans to go to mars
i never found the report so i don't know exactly how to describe that
but to go to mars the nasa program said you have to have a space station to first develop medical information about man's long duration in space in other words how long a guy could last in space to go out to mars and it became a fuel transfer operation where low earth orbit rendezvous and docking and transfer of fuel would be made for a device to go onto mars
so that second case the one of build the shuttle and go to mars was the one that agnew and paine recommended
paine in his mind said there has got to be a space station with that
and so he left in place the studies that nasa had out with industry on building a space station
and nasa then started a program on a fully recoverable two stage shuttle
there have been a lot of studies on how to do that and we are going to get into some of the system dynamics that we were involved in that program as we go along here
meanwhile the budget crashed
nasa had a budget of about dollars six billion in one thousand nine hundred sixty eight
and by one thousand nine hundred seventy it was down to about dollars three point seven billion
actually at the same time the manned space flight budget had gone from about dollars three billion down to dollars one point seven billion
so it got hit even harder than the rest of nasa during this time period
and the reasons well we were in the middle of the vietnam war the budget deficit was going up dramatically president johnson who started the great society program for the poor in the country and that was a big load on the budget
and nixon just wasn't a big supporter of the space program and so the budget was going down
the question was is there going to be a human space flight program at all
and that was a really big question because in a time period about a year after this period one of the senators put a bill before the senate to cancel the shuttle
the shuttle phase b program was underway by that time
we did studies
phase a a small amount of money to industry
phase b was enough to get a definition to where you could decide that you were ready to go into detailed design
and phase cd was actually the design and development and testing
so we were into phase b on the shuttle at that time
he brought forward to the senate let's cancel the shuttle and the vote was fifty point fifty
so the vice president had to go in and vote to keep the shuttle program going
that is how close to cancellation it was
now a really important guy in all this was a guy named george miller
he had been head of the manned space flight program
he had been the stimulus within nasa for this broad systems study of going out to lunar bases and then to mars
and he left in late one thousand nine hundred sixty nine
he had done his job
he got man to the moon and home safely and he saw this cut in budgets going on
i don't know whether that really influenced him to leave but i think his general pattern had been that whatever he wanted to do he wanted to complete it successfully and then he would move on
and he did that with the apollo program so he moved on
george was a guy that really supported this tremendous set of future dreams for nasa
tom paine left in late one thousand nine hundred seventy
and the reason he left was he kept pushing for a space station
and the people in the administration had kind of seen the studies that had been done by this space task group where agnew had said let's do the shuttle and then let's go to mars
paine knowing in his few that you had to have a space station to be able to go to mars
kept pushing the twelve man space station that would require a saturn v for a launch so it was a big expense
and it was a program that really called for nasa's budget to go up instead of down
he accepted the idea that it had been pushed down to the dollars three point seven billion level but he expected it to be dollars six billion or dollars eight billion by one thousand nine hundred seventy four
and nobody in the administration was buying that so he left in one thousand nine hundred seventy
and i think he was sort of asked to leave
i don't know that for a fact but all the evidence would seem to be that he wasn't really making it with the administration
and i think this by the way turns out to be kind of an important part here because when tom paine left there was kind of a bad taste in the administration about nasa being too aggressive and wanting more and more big programs
paine left in one thousand nine hundred seventy
george low became the acting administrator and he became a very important part of the shuttle system background
his background by the way started way early in nasa
and he had been the program manager for the command and service module for a period of time before he went up to nasa headquarters
and i guess aaron you became the program manager after george left
and so i came in in january of one thousand nine hundred seventy
i had been in charge of the command and service module at rockwell
and george low asked me to come back
and i had worked so closely with george that i felt kind of a commitment to help in that area
so i went back in one thousand nine hundred seventy jim fletcher came in in april of one thousand nine hundred seventy one and we saw where we stood as far as the budget was concerned
so one thousand nine hundred seventy with this new cast of characters we kind of accepted the idea that we were in trouble to the place where we could lose manned space flight completely
and our real strategy had to be to get something that would be important to the future of nasa with respect to the programs
and our view was the most important part of the game was to build a shuttle that would reduce the cost of getting into orbit
and that was the whole idea of the shuttle
there was a general consensus that if you had a shuttle that would be recoverable and reusable it would reduce the cost of the operations
as they used to say in those days i think i have it on another chart you wouldn't think of flying from san diego to boston on an airplane and then throwing away the airplane
which was of course what we were doing with the ballistic systems
but we thought if we could get a low cost transportation system to a low earth orbit the rest of the systems would then follow naturally
but because of the budget picture and because of where we stood with the shuttle in phase b recognizing it was going to be an expensive program things started to fall out of the program
they cancelled the apollo eighteen and nineteen
i guess twenty had already been cancelled
and they cancelled saturn one b and the saturn v which were our big heavy lift capabilities
cancelled the second skylab that was already essentially complete
that is the one that is in the smithsonian museum in washington
cancelled the command and service modules
cancelled the thirty foot diameter space stations
and that was a big hit against the group because we were in phase b there getting ready to go into detailed design on a thirty foot diameter space station
we didn't start the space tug we didn't start the nuclear stage and we cancelled the mars program
no excuse me we deferred the mars program
industry went down from four hundred thousand people working for all the nasa programs down to about one hundred fifty point zero
i have seen numbers lower than that
now concept for the shuttle reusability equals low cost
that was fundamental
everybody believed that
we had studies done by all sorts of outside groups
ida the aerospace corporation and others did studies that essentially agreed with us that there would be a terrific reduction in the cost of getting stuff into orbit if we would build a recoverable vehicle
now it was clear that since the r and d already t and e costs are higher but you need a whole bunch of flights
if you had a few flights the extra r and d on the shuttle wouldn't pay off because you could build cheap ballistic launch vehicles that would pay off before the shuttle
so you need a lot of flights for a recoverable vehicle to be economical
the lower the r and d the less flights needed to be better than the ballistic launch vehicles
and if you got a lot of flights because the flight costs are so low then a two stage fully recoverable system would be the right way to go
that was our concepts of what we were dealing with on the shuttle
there has been a lot of technology
i don't know how many of you know that the early lifting body was done by a guy named burnelli
not bernoulli but burnelli
burnelli was in long island and he built the first lifting body
that is an airfoil section and that is a broad piece of fuselage wide enough that the two engines could be involved in it
big windows for transport
it was really quite an interesting beginning of a cargo airplane in one thousand nine hundred twenty one
he built one of them and that was the end of that but there were a lot of other things going on
after sputnik the united states just kind of went wild with ideas for a while and then settled down on having nasa put in place deciding that the military dinosaurs and mold programs wouldn't be done that nasa would take over that kind of activity
but we got some really interesting stuff going
hl ten lifting body
x twenty four a lifting body
x fifteen although that was not considered a space device by the time they put external tanks on it it got up to mach six and three hundred thousand feet
really some terrific performance out of that airplane
and then i added the navaho which i worked on for many years because it had a parallel tank separation at mach three
the booster was under the vehicle
the vehicle was a ramjet vehicle and it separated at mach three at about forty thousand feet
it was a high dynamic pressure separation but it showed us that parallel separation would work
and that gets into this picture later
next step was in that sixty nine to seventy one time period this guy named max faget who is really important almost a genius in my mind in design that did the original mercury and gemini capsules physically designed the shape of the apollo command module and then came up with this first sort of practical view of a two stage fully recoverable system
it had straight wings like an x fifteen
in fact if you looked at the plan form it looked quite a lot like an x fifteen
but it had two of them
it had pilots in each of the two stages
it had internal fuel
it had metal shingles what i used to call unobtanium but it was like molybdenum and rene forty one and some really interesting materials which were really difficult to handle
stress corrosion problems and all kinds of things that were tough to handle
that is why i talked about unobtanium or some ablative
and max expected to have to use ablative on the leading edge of the wings
and it had varying payloads
the highest one i saw in any of the history was twenty thousand pounds
but fourteen point zero twenty point zero that kind of thing
a payload bay of about twelve point forty and four hundred miles max crossrange
this gets important in requirements
and at that time because we were going to have all these space stations and go to the moon and all that sort of stuff we were going to have one hundred to one hundred fifty flights a year
and if you have a lot of flights it overcomes the base cost of the rdt and e
and he was getting down into the dollars five million a flight in his estimates
but meanwhile because we had lost the space station we had lost the lunar base all this grand plan had disappeared we needed more payloads
we needed to get up to the forty to fifty payloads a year to be able to make the shuttle look economic at the levels of cost effectiveness that the office of management and budget was demanding of us
after this vote in the senate george low decided that we had to be responsive to the omb so we had to get some more flights
and this is where our requirements began to come into the picture
we spent about a year working with the military where they finally agreed they would put all their payloads and i mean all their payloads on the shuttle if we could meet the cost estimates that we had
the commercial people were eager to get on the shuttle if our costs would be this low because they were beginning to see launch costs equal to or more than the cost of the satellites that we were putting up
and the science people bought into the idea of space servicing
this really got important because they agreed to design the hubble space telescope so that it could be serviced in space
and that turned out to be of course the key to the hubble because of the mistake that was made in the mirror
the re servicing of the hubble space telescope is what by bringing another optics in front of this distorted mirror brought the hubble back to the fantastic performance that it has today
in your opinion was the science community really anxious to have this servicing or was it something that was really forced upon them to increase the constituency
i think originally they thought they were being forced
but as they thought it through they could see that they could later change sensors and add additional stuff
at least i know that the head of the science group i cannot think of his name now enthusiastically supported that and got the system out there to support that idea
and they worked very closely with us on how to design it so that you could get access to the thing in space
with all the difficulty we had with gloves and so on they worked to help us understand how to remove and replace systems
was there at that time if you recall an opposition from the space science community to the size of the nasa budget that was being spent on the shuttle in the manned program
oh absolutely
yeah there was
but on the other hand some of the committees like the town committee supported the shuttle because they could see other science opportunities that were involved
so they didn't gang on us
they were shooting arrows at us here and there
and let me go on with the requirements
because of the military requirements we had to change our specifications
and this became another one of the elements that drove the final design
the military wanted a sixty foot long payload bay
it had been forty in the designs that we had been doing so far
they wanted forty thousand pounds polar and that made our due east payload up to about sixty five point zero
that was a big change from twenty thousand to sixty five point zero
and they needed one thousand five hundred crossrange
they wanted to be able to go around the earth while the earth turned and land at the same spot
so they had to have one thousand five hundred miles of crossrange
now you can do it a lot of different ways
you could carry turbojets when you came back in and fly it back the one thousand five hundred miles or you could do it without turbojets which means you have to have aerodynamic crossrange while you are coming in
payload bay increased to fifteen point sixty
fifteen was an increase by nasa because they saw that they didn't have a saturn v anymore to do space station so the best they could do was increase the diameter of the shuttle to where they have a fifteen foot diameter to where they could carry the sections of the space station that we now have in the program
we thought anything less than that was just too cramped for the guys
we decided that we would find a non ablative reusable thermal protection system
technology had moved far enough by that time that we were beginning to see these ceramic tiles develop to the place where they looked feasible
they had been able to find a hardening for the surface that made them less penetratable than they had been
and carbon carbon came in that we could use for the leading edge for three thousand degree leading edge temperatures
we followed the tradition that said if it is fully recoverable it is going to be cheaper so let's go for a two stage fully recoverable system
and of course all the other things that we were developing at that time to reduce the cost of operations with automatic checkout and so on
well that's a bad picture
i am not an expert at this stuff so i wasn't able to get that slide down far enough to show where the saturn v was but saturn v is only about fifty percents longer than that upper stage there
so this thing had gotten big
and the booster was larger than a seven hundred forty seven
it had to operate up to about mach six
the orbiter was about the size of an md eighty md ninety twin engine small transport
and so they were big
and these things had twelve big high pressure engines in them
and we in management and i think the guys in design were getting pretty worried about whether an airplane that large at that mach number was going to be a practical thing in terms of a system
and that's not a system engineering approach
that's sort of a gut feeling that you get after being in the airplane business for a lot of years and watching the development problems that were involved on the x fifteen for example
how long it took the x fifteen to get to where it could go to mach six
but that was the direction we were going in
by the way one of the companies had the wings on the orbiter turned up
i don't know why but they had them turned up
and by the way the reason you see two different configurations here is in our phase b studies to the industry we said design us one that only has four hundred miles crossrange and design us one that has one thousand five hundred miles crossrange
the upper ones have one thousand five hundred miles crossrange
and the delta wing will do that the straight wings won't
so as we developed these requirements it became clear that we were not going to go with a straight wing system
these phase b studies that we had showed that we were going to have a development cost of some place between dollars twelve billion and dollars fifteen billion for r and d
and about that time nixon had a meeting with fletcher and said you can build any kind of shuttle you want as long as it only costs dollars five billion
well that was a big shock to the system
and having heard that omb said make it cost effective
and that was a real tremendous driver in the system because we had never been asked to do that before
and we had a whole new set of requirements to try to deal with
so we had had this phase b program it was almost complete we had all these big beautiful configuration studies and we had to look again
so we went out and said let's get imaginative guys
let's see if there is any way that we can reduce the cost
there had been enough going on where one of the companies had been looking at the possibility of putting external tanks like drop tanks on the top of the wing on each side two of them one on each side of the orbiter
and it made the orbiter itself of course much smaller
remember we were carrying hydrogen and oxygen and we were doing it inside the vehicles
it is in those studies you saw in phase b
and so it grew the outside dimensions tremendously
and by going externally with the fuels it really shrank down the system to where the diameter of a payload compartment was essentially the diameter of the orbiter
and so people began to look at other ways to do it
we had guys coming in talking about single staged orbit
and that was one that i rejected without study because i knew that the mass fractions required for that were just out of the world of reality
there was a thing called a trinese where the theory was you had three vehicles
they were deltas and fit together in a nice little teepee
and two of them would be used for boosters going up and the third one would go on into orbit
and that was kind of a dumb idea
because it turns out boosters and orbiters have entirely different requirements
and so they might look the same on paper but they would not be the same when you build them
lockheed came in with an x twenty four b which had tanks mounted up forward of the delta wing
and the idea would be that they would peel off after fuel was fed to the main engines in the orbiter itself
and then we began to see these external orbiter tank studies
and when the tanks began to look good externally then the question is do you boost from under the tank or do you boost with two boosters parallel to the tank itself
when the tanks went external it finally ended up obvious that it would want one tank instead of two
so the one tank went underneath the orbiter
then the question is do you boost through the tank or do you boost in parallel to the tank with two attached boosters
so we had all these different studies
and what was happening in the administration was they were kind of locked up with reducing manned space flight budget down to like dollars one point five to dollars one point seven billion
and we needed to do this cost effectiveness study for omb
we hired an outfit called mathematica which had a senior well known economist named morgenstern and a bright young guy named klaus heiss who did a study for us on the cost effectiveness of the shuttle
and to make a very long story short the results were that the present configuration that we have for the shuttle today is the one that looked the best
present configuration being an orbiter with a tank under it with the hydrogen and oxygen in that tank fed separately into the orbiter and to the main engines which were so expensive that we wanted to recover them
and boosters being solid rockets attached to the tank so that the total vehicle was a little shorter
oh an important point
at that time the solids were recoverable
their wall thickness was enough that you could use the solid rockets drop them off by parachute into the ocean pick them up bring them back clean them out and use them again
and that was going to be a cost saving in the program
and by doing all this we had liftoff thrust augmentation of the engines in the orbiter
these engines by the way were twelve thousand pounds per square inch internal pressure engines stage combustion
the most advanced technology you could imagine
and they were started a year before the shuttle was started to give them more time to develop
they almost became the long pole of the tent but i think maybe when it finally boiled down the thermal protection was the longest pole
he was down there trying to fix them
i think he was almost down there gluing them on
down at the cape when we were getting ready to launch we were still having trouble getting the thermal protection system working right
well the result of all this and there were a lot of other things that happened at the time in one thousand nine hundred seventy one i don't remember when the supersonic transport was cancelled
and that was a big technology blow to this country
in other words there was a major program that would have absorbed a lot of the high tech engineers that were involved in the apollo program
and i think some of the administration thought the supersonic transport is a better place to have our technology capability than would be a shuttle
but supersonic transport was cancelled by boeing
and i think that probably helped the atmosphere that was involved
but the other thing that happened is that congress and the administration finally got the idea that we really weren't going to build a space station immediately
that we were just interested in getting the shuttle started
and so we didn't have this massive budget increase that tom paine kept wanting
and fletcher kept working on trying to get budgets spread so that it wouldn't be a major peak in budgets close in
and he did that by starting the main engine early starting the tanks late starting with solids late and putting an obvious emphasis on the orbiter itself
so that spread the budget out and helped a lot in giving the administration the feeling that we weren't going to kill them with budget requirements
so nixon started the program january of one thousand nine hundred seventy two
george low and jim fletcher went over and had about a forty minute talk with president nixon and he announced the same day we were going to start building the shuttle
it was going to be a reusable orbiter the engines in the orbiter reusable solid cases an extendable fuel tank forty to fifty flights a year dollars ten million to dollars fifteen million a flight
our internal calculations were more like dollars ten million but we wanted to have some pad in it
and dollars five point two billion plus a twenty percents reserve for the administrator for what we call unk unks unknown unknowns things you get into trouble during a development program where you need some more money to do some more testing
and nixon agreed to that
the bureau of the budget was in the meeting with him
and as soon as nixon left office the office of management budget forgot the twenty percents
so then it was now dollars five point two billion of one thousand nine hundred seventy dollars
to make it worse the nasa comptroller pressed i'm sure by omb didn't agree that we would use one thousand nine hundred seventy as the base
he took the dollars five point two billion in one thousand nine hundred seventy two
we lost two years of inflation
well it may not sound like a lot to you but boy it sounded like a lot to the guys working on the program because it was clear that we were going to have a tough time meeting that budget
here i am explaining to the press i think it was about two days after nixon's announcement one of the studies was to use the first stage of the saturn v the s one c
this one apparently i think this is the winged version because all the engines at their back center gradually all the way back here some place
and we were using in this design using the first stage of saturn v boosting directly into the tank which was attached to the orbiter
this one was parallel
i guess that was liquids
they look like they have bigger diameter
and i didn't talk about that but a lot of people were pushing a pressure fed liquid engine so that you'd be sure you had the capability to cut them off
and the idea was that because they were pressure fed that the thickness of the walls was enough that they too could be recovered in the ocean and brought back
and the final decision by the people that were in the propulsion business in nasa was that the technology looked tough
it was new
we didn't have a background of pressure fed boosters
and the solids as we will get to later looked like they were a better deal
so the design issues as i saw them as the head of manned space flight were that the delta wing was required for crossrange
external tanks were much lighter the system got to be about half the weight because of all the reduction in external configuration when you took all the fuel out and put it separately in the tank
thermal insulation we bought off on the ceramic tile the carbon carbon and fiber blankets the same as we have today solid or liquid boosters
the solids looked more reliable at that time
there had been a history of solids on many of the large military boosters and they looked better
and at that time i thought we were going to have a way to terminate the thrust of the solids
engine location and type started on the ground for safer better performance and the stage combustion for better performance
we had under our study retractable turbojets
once you got into the atmosphere you would pop these turbojets out and flew home
and we decided we couldn't handle it
thank god we had had all this lifting body experience where the guys that landed these very low elevatory devices
actually the orbiter had a little better elevatory than some of the hl ten s and x twenty four s so we dropped the turbojets out of the system
series versus parallel boosters series was heavier and had less performance with a lot more bending loads in the system
when we go up we go max q
and with crosswinds we get big loads on that wing
and so this turned out to be a heavier way to do it
well a little more on solids versus liquids
i always like to tell this story about solids could be shipped by rail
i can say it another way
the diameter of the solids was set by rail shipment
and there is a story which i am sure some of you have heard that the rails of the american rails were set first by the british who brought the british rail system to the united states
the british rail system was set by the width of the wheels on the carts that they used to have
and the cart's width was set by the roman chariots that used to be on the roads because they made grooves in the tiles
so that set the diameter of the shuttle
and the roman chariot's wheel width was set by two horses in front of them
so there are some who say that the diameter of the shuttle rocket engines was designed by two horses' asses
those were the guys that wanted to use liquid
they can be shipped by rail
they had a better reliability record at the time
solids could be recovered
industry studied pressure fed to recover them too but we didn't buy that
the designers thought they could turn off the solids but later found out they couldn't turn them off uniformly and that the thrust variance that would be involved between the two would be totally beyond the capability of the vehicle to sustain it
so we dropped it
thermal insulation we talked about it
they were all new developments that had been experimentally tested they looked like they were going to work but we had a lot of work to do
and the ceramic tiles really turned out to be one of the toughest new technologies that we got into
high pressure stage combustion engine we knew that was a big new development
and so as i said that was started early
and design crew escape well the idea was we were going to be able to terminate the thrust on the rocket engines
and we looked at these rockets to pull away the cabin we looked at all that stuff and none of them had a broad application
you had the question of safety
if you took it off at the launch site if you took the whole front end off the vehicle at the launch site it had big questions of the reliability of the system
we went through a lot of studies to try to find a way to capture the crew in case of a problem and never found a system that fit into the program
so we ended up with crew escape only with a complete structure
and that of course was the problem in challenger
we ended up wrecking the structure to where we did not have a recovery capability but we put in a system where if the vehicle were complete and structurally sound and was gliding the guys could get out
but that was the only escape system that we had
i wanted to touch operation costs a little bit
we had built enormous confidence from the apollo program
in spite of the apollo thirteen problem the rest of the vehicles had worked beautifully
i used to say that every flight always had man in the loop some place during the flight that was important to the success of the program
many times it was a minor thing
like when apollo twelve got struck by lightning when it was launched the guys were able to reconfigure switches to get the power back on get everything back to normal and had a nice flight to the moon and hit a few golf balls
every flight had man involved but every flight was a tremendous success except apollo thirteen
and at the time we were dealing here in the one thousand nine hundred seventy time period
well april of one thousand nine hundred seventy was when we launched apollo thirteen
anyway we had tremendous confidence
and we thought we had tremendous support from the industry and we thought we had tremendous support from the public but we still were concerned about the operational costs so we hired american airlines for one to work with us on what the costs would be and how would you design the system to give you the least operational costs
the military because they were committing to put their payloads on the shuttle had studies done by the aerospace corporation about the operation costs
there was a study done by ida institute of defense analysis
all three of them agreed that we were going to have tremendous reductions in the cost of operations
they didn't quite come down to the same levels that nasa had estimated but they were close
it was kind of interesting that we all thought it could be done
we all thought there could be be enormous reductions in the cost of operations with the shuttle
we thought we had enough space based hardware that we could do quick turnarounds and handle it more like an airplane
but nasa and these groups didn't really properly account for the costs associated with post flight maintenance the rocket engine
when ida and aerospace did the studies we told them the rocket engine was going to be reusable for at least twenty flights
well it turned out it wasn't
and it was such an enormous new development that in the early flights of the shuttle it took a lot of time and a lot of effort to replace engines and refurbish engines
assuring the safety of flight in a hostile environment and space is hostile and we are dealing here with what amounts to a short amount of r and d development testing when you get into these flights
difficult cutting edge technologies
the engine in the thermal program the tiles worked but they often got chips outs of the tiles so we had to replace tiles between flights
and this is fail operation fail operation fail safe
the airplanes have fail operation fail safe
they took the attitude that if you had three computers that was plenty and if one went bad during a checkout you launched anyway
you don't know that but that is what is happening to you on commercial airplanes today
we went one more
we went fail operation fail operation fail safe
we have four computers in the shuttle but we cannot fly without all four in perfect condition
so those things add cost when you do that
and then cost tradeoffs between r and d and operations people have argued with me many times that our decision to put the tank externally was a bad deal
it turns out that it was certainly a bad deal on columbia
the foam on that tank came off and hit the carbon carbon leading edge of the wing and broke a hole in it and caused thermal excesses in the re entry
so you could argue yeah we should have had a two stage fully recoverable system
but those were the cost tradeoffs that were involved in getting a system that would be accepted and bought off on by the administration
i want to talk a little bit about operation costs
that has been the big miss that we made in this program
as i said cost of operations never got down to what it should have been
well it never got down there for a couple of reasons
we were never able to get up to a flight rate that would favor a reusable vehicle
i think we got up to twenty six flights in one year but most of them were down around eight or ten
and so we weren't up far enough to offset the cost of the research and development costs to get the operational costs down low
but i have an interesting little summary
it is not an exact thing at all but it gives you a little feeling for what i have seen out in this program
in one thousand nine hundred seventy the dollars ten million flight price was based on the same accounting system that we used for the apollo
now when you go down to cape canaveral we had a lot of other things going on besides apollo
and so we had the common support activities like the medical department and the mail system and all that sort of stuff as a common separate accounting
and all the costs for the apollo were those that we called hands on things associated with buying parts bringing in spares putting on spares checking out the vehicle and launching it
so we had two different pieces of money involved in the apollo program and one of them never even was charged to the apollo program
so we used that same system it seemed logical to go ahead with the same accounting system for the shuttle as we did for the apollo
well it turned out that these separate items were a pretty big chunk of money
and i have assumed that it was about dollars four hundred million a year
i am not sure that is right but i wanted to do it just to give you an idea of what happens with inflation
remember we said we would do this job using one thousand nine hundred seventy dollars and we said that the costs would be dollars ten million of one thousand nine hundred seventy dollars
with dollars four hundred million in overhead and inflation according to the consumer's price index which i looked up on google by the way they have a nice little calculator for inflation forty flights a year no overhead in other words like apollo a dollars ten million price in one thousand nine hundred seventy would be dollars twenty three million by first flight and would be dollars fifty million now
same forty flights but including overhead would make the flight cost dollars twenty million in one thousand nine hundred seventy dollars forty five million in one thousand nine hundred eighty one and dollars one hundred one million per flight for forty flights in two thousand five
a huge increased price because of the inflation that occurred in the one thousand nine hundred eighty to one thousand nine hundred eighty two time period
eight flights per year including overhead runs it up to dollars sixty million in one thousand nine hundred seventy dollars
and eight flights per year is sort of what we have been running here recently dollars one hundred thirty five million at time of first flight and dollars three hundred two million a flight in two thousand five
now the cost per flight on the shuttle i don't know
i know that it is up in that dollars four hundred million or dollars five hundred million price
i use this only to give you kind of a rough feeling that although we missed operational costs badly we didn't really just be totally out of the ballpark on them
shuttle performance is great
the shuttle has done everything it was designed to do and probably a few more things we didn't think of at the time
it has put military devices in orbit commercial devices in orbit scientific payloads all to leo with solids we brought along and it has taken stuff to geo geosynchronous orbits
it has retrieved and replaced satellites
it has retrieved satellites and brought them down to the ground and repaired them and brought them back into orbit
it has repaired satellites in orbit and it has launched elements to the space station
in the one thousand nine hundred eighty s the shuttle had only four percents of all the launches in the country but carried forty one percents of the mass launched
shuttle r and d was well within what nixon and fletcher agreed to dollars five point two billion plus twenty percents in one thousand nine hundred seventy dollars
and i mean quite a lot of it
probably the twenty percents only about five percents to ten percents of that was actually used
in that sense they overran what the omb said we were to develop it for where they didn't give us the twenty percents reserve
we overran it by five percents or ten percents
missed two key design issues
call them system engineering issues
cold o rings in the challenger
we had o rings in that vehicle which when they were cold they lost their flexibility
and when they were cold in a design that was opened a little bit when the pressure came on internally that was a disaster waiting to happen
so that was a bad design of the way the o rings were designed into the vehicle
the second one is the foam shedding
we knew that we were going to have ice and or foam on that tank and we really pressed the industry to make sure that that foam was going to stay on
we had foam enough that we didn't get a lot of icing but we had foam that had to stay on
because we know that as it shed we didn't think so much of the carbon carbon as the tiles these brittle tiles that we had on the bottom of the shuttle
so foam shedding was known to be a problem all the way through this arm of the development but just has not been able to solved
and after the columbia accident the martin company i assume worked for two years trying to make that foam stick better
and it did stick better but pieces still came off
so the fleet has been grounded and they got to get that fixed
and of course we missed the operational cost
two stage reusable vehicle would have missed worse i am sure of that because of the size of that first stage booster and the mach numbers it had to go to
i guess i have concluded that spacecraft are not like airplanes
every flight is a structural dive demonstration
you know you develop an airplane and you fly it many times before you fly it to the corner of a vg diagram
and i can only think of one exception
a guy named weese welch one of the greatest test pilots north america every had flew the first flight of the f eighty six which is the fancy new jet that we brought in just before the korean war
and on his first flight it flew so well that he took it into a little dive and the mach meter went up to one
and actually the ground data showed that he probably went to one point four
some say they heard a sonic boom
i am not sure of that
but that was about a month before the x one went supersonic
in those days test pilots were kind of innovative and they did things that they were told not to do
and he did it
but every flight is a structural dive demonstration
we go right up to max q every time we fly
we go through wind shears and take it up to high gs
we go to high gs on the way up we go to high gs on the way down we go max thermal every flight
so we are dealing with a tough set of activities when we do this
no reusable space system ever gets the millions of hours of stressed operation that airplanes get
once an airplane gets through development it starts getting millions of hours of test data or information where if you have a problem you fix it
and you just don't get that in these systems
the space system has decades of evolutionary model development
in other words the airplane business has been so dramatically economical that you could build new airplanes every ten years or so
and each new airplane took advantage of all the things known from the past airplane and designed into it
as i said every reusable system is exposed to enormous environmental variations every time
thermal vibration pressure mach number all these things happen every time
and so i look at the shuttle as being an amazing piece of machinery which is done extremely well in what i consider a continuing r and d environment
we just don't have yet an operational system
so my view of the next program keep it simple
it has sort of been a prime view that i have had of design every since i have been in the airplane business
don't stretch the technology
use really good margins of safety because we are dealing here with as i said maximum conditions on every flight
you better play it safe
keep it small
carry as few passengers as possible
carry people or cargo but not both
keep the requirements to a minimum
use as many past components and systems as have been proven to be reliable
design for operations very important
easy access
one man can replace a black box
you don't have to run a big pickup machine to take something out of it
and keep the design reserved while you are designing it so that when operational issues come up you can design for the operational issue and keep reducing the cost of operations
i don't know what all that means
i think it means that if we had it to do over again it would have been great to be able to contain the requirements within nasa probably build a much smaller system that you could get many more test flights at lower cost but we didn't have that opportunity as you now know
so we have the shuttle disappearing into the distance
decision has been made that the shuttle be phased out in two thousand ten
and it is going to be a tough issue because now the shuttle is down in between flights because we lost foam on the last flight
they grounded the fleet until we can figure out what to do about that foam problem
and then hurricane katrina knocked off the top of the vab which isn't a big deal but it really messed up some of the tank facilities and tank access
and people's lives have been affected with losses of homes
so there is a whole bunch of new issues involved in the shuttle that i read in the paper this morning which may mean another delay in the next launch of the shuttle
and that means a compression of the time between now and two thousand ten when they are trying to use the shuttle to meet the commitments that we have with the europeans and the japanese about putting pieces of the space station up into space
an interesting new problem for the shuttle
ok let's take a one minute stretch break
stand up if you'd like turn around in a few circles and then we will have a half an hour for some questions answers and general comments
the external environment the background what went into the design of the shuttle
and i think what dale alluded to at the end is very much to the point and we will be talking about this with the people when they talk about the individual systems
in terms of the actual performance which we have gotten out of the shuttle despite the fact that we have had two catastrophic accidents which by the way involved not only the design of the shuttle but the way we operated the shuttle
and that is an important thing that we will spend time talking about
had we not made the decision to launch challenger on that cold day who knows what would have happened
and similarly we accepted the fact that foam was continually falling off of the tank even though that was incompatible with the design specifications on the thermal insulation for the shuttle
so we had basically two parts of the shuttle system and we had design incompatibilities but we chose to keep on flying
but as a whole the shuttle has been remarkably successful from a technical point of view in terms of what we have been able to do in near earth space has been i think compared to what you could do working out of an apollo capsule was absolutely phenomenal
and in fact i think in terms of near earth operations the shuttle will be sorely missed when we retire it and there will be a lot of capabilities that we will be giving up
but on the other hand where we really got it wrong by orders of magnitude was in the cost and reusability of the shuttle
now perhaps that goes back to the requirements because again we were trying to do an awful lot of things for the very first time and yet we were being told by the office of management and budget that you said it had to be cost effective
i mean in a sense nasa was being asked to operate the shuttle almost as a commercial enterprise and to make money on it
this is like you build a test vehicle for the first time and you are being asked at the same time to operate it at a profit
and as you know one of the systems engineering principles is you have this triangle
i am sure you have all seen this
performance cost schedule you have all seen the triangle right
and you cannot specify all three
they are not all independent parameters
if you specify the performance and then you're limiting the cost you cannot control the schedule
anyway all three of those we in a sense got specified when we accepted the requirements to build the shuttle
and something has to give
and in the end it was the schedule and the cost
and we will have more to say about this in the next couple of lectures but now let's take advantage of the last twenty minutes and give you a chance to ask some questions about the content of the lecture
and dale can try to answer them
i will say by the way in terms of the schedule of the class when this was given as an aircraft systems course there were two lectures of an hour and a half and then there was a laboratory period scheduled on wednesdays
and the idea i think was that by scheduling a lab everybody would have one period of time at the same time so that it would make it easier for you to work as teams on your project
because we have so many people coming from out of town i thought that it would be better to make sure that they have full time to interact with you
and so we didn't schedule a laboratory period for this course
instead we have two two hour lectures
and i am assuming that all of you once you form teams will be able to work out some times when you can get together
the only other thing i will mention if you look ahead for tuesday september the twenty th that is the first deliverable regarding your term project
and all we want you to do there is just to think about what subsystem you might be interested in studying and write a paragraph about what you think you might want to do with it
and what we will do is we will be taking a spiral approach to this project
so if you look ahead you will see there are various times when we ask for preliminary results
and then we will work with you give you guidance in how to deepen that so that then you can go back
and the next time you hand something in it will be at a deeper level until the end when you're finished with the project
ok let's move into the question and answer period
and there has been a lot of material presented
and this is your chance to ask the guy who was here when it all happened
thanks so much for coming
dale why don't you take center stage now
i was kind of intrigued by your talking about the different phases of development
you called it phase a phase b and c d
and i was kind of wondering when in those phases you kind of developed the high level requirements when you developed kind of low level requirements how much industry was involved in different levels
what percent was industry engineers and what percent was nasa engineers in those studies
and i was just wondering if you could expand on that
yeah
good question
the theory is that you do phase a as conceptual activity and when you have gotten your requirements nailed down you then do a phase b
and that's what we thought we had done
it turned out that military requirements came in after phase b had been started so we actually had to change the contracts with the industry to take into consideration those military requirements
and they were a big change to the requirements
so in that sense we had some inefficiency in phase b
and it was after we began to get the results of phase b that we realized we didn't have a system that was going to meet the requirements
so instead of canceling phase b we finished the phase b because we needed that basic understanding of all of the systems and all of the elements that made up the system
we finished phase b but we started some additional phase as conceptual activities to try to find a solution
and i don't remember how we worked from the recognition of the new configuration back into the phase b guys
oh we had a phase b extension to bring that new configuration
nasa's decision that we would go to an external tank
we modified the phase b studies again with an extension that allowed the industry then to catch up with what was going on
and by the time we finished that phase b extension we all the requirements in place we had all of the design understood well enough to start phase c d
i think it is pretty amazing that a device that was going to do what we wanted to do with the shuttle go into orbit come back in and land the configuration really stayed the same from that point on
it is just amazing that we did that well i think in definition so that when we really started the c and d phase which is the detailed design things stayed in place
and that meant all the aerodynamic work that had been done which was by the way the most aerodynamic work most wind tunnel testing ever done on a new system i think logically because we were working through the mach number range
and all of the other elemental testing that had gone on all allowed us to keep the configuration identical from that point
i know there has been a lot of talk but it seems obvious now in hindsight that the capsule or the orbiter or what have you should be on the top of the launcher to clear it from the debris from the fuel tank or what else
what i'm wondering is at the time in the early stages was there ever any talk about safety issues in putting the orbiter so low on the hull on the side
yeah there was a lot of talk with martin about foam shedding at that time
and during the initial decision process for putting it on the side we had done studies of stacking it in series
and it was a weight problem
it was literally an issue of the structural weight of the orbiter mounted vertically because of the terrific loads that you get separately on that system
and so we recognized that the side mounted tank was going to be a much more economical system
so we had to worry about ice and foam
and so we had a lot of discussion with martin company at that time
i think we did a lot of work down at marshall too
that's a very good question
in fact i will try to develop some of that thought process as we go along
the key point to make is the following
should we have challenged the requirements
making the orbiter so big with the payload base so big it was very difficult to put that on top
if you made it smaller you could
the real question i think and i was going to ask dale this question which is a follow up to yours should nasa once omb and the white house gave a cost constraint and once we had the change in the air force requirements should nasa had said no we don't want to do it
and that is really a very fundamental issue in terms of understanding your requirements because the requirements drove the fourteen day turnaround time the fact that you wanted large payloads you wanted to get to the payloads put the orbiter where it was
the fact that you needed a high performance engine and a lot of payload in orbit said that you needed a liquid oxygen liquid hydrogen engine to get the highest specific impulse to get the engine at highest performance
all that added together the thermal protection system was basically a glass house which was incompatible with material coming off the tank
so there was some you might say incompatibilities and requirements
and the question is should we have challenged those requirements more strongly
that's really the fundamental question
i don't think we should of
but let me ask dale because it would say what you would have done with the orbiter
i did
i challenged the requirements inside nasa
i never challenged it with the military but i challenged it inside nasa with george low and with jim fletcher
and their conclusion was that we would not have a manned space flight program if we challenged the military requirements
and then the rest of it followed
but your question is a very very pertinent question
yeah it sure is
it is a very key question in today's environment
of course you are infinitely smarter after it happens but your point is very well taken
do we have better systems engineering tools now than we did in the seventy s
and so if you used today's tools to design the shuttle then it would be better
i think
well of course
would you have avoided cost overrun and so on
system engineering is better yes
cost estimation i'm not so sure
we had the best guys in the country doing cost estimations on the shuttle but we missed it probably as much as anything else by just not having those people understand the complexities of operating in space
and i think a lot more is known generally now about the cost of operating in space
i think that the next try at a reduction in cost for getting into space will be a much more significant activity but i consider cost estimation a part of system engineering
a lot of it is much better some of it is not i think
well just to follow up a little bit
when we designed the orbiter we didn't have cad cam systems
if you look in the aft end of the orbiter it is sort of like the hardest thing you have ever seen because we didn't have a computer aided design
if we had had that we probably would have done a much easier job in the aft end of the orbiter and in the mid fuselage and in the cockpit
that is systems engineering
you today have much more valuable tools than we had during the apollo program and during the shuttle program but there still is a lot of education you need in systems engineering
and i think doctor hoffman explained the famous triangle cost schedule and performance
and that is a continued work in systems engineering
and i always think of systems engineering as the people who work across the system with everybody in a real communication system
and it is that kind of communication that does good system engineering
tools are not
ok
anything else
could you talk a little bit about the astronaut office and what they thought during these conversations
were they in favor of the recoverable fully piloted booster and what were their input on the risk conversations
yeah
they were aware of it
we kept in touch all the way through the development program including the decisions not to have a launch abort system
and they all recognized there was risk in the program no question about it
aaron you were there
what about it
well you said it right
i think that's right
they were part of the design and development team and the requirements team so they were very much in favor of it
of course the big issue which we will talk more about is escape systems
and we will go into that a little bit
why don't we have an escape system
and i'm sure when chris kraft comes you can ask him a lot of questions about that
i'm sure he will have a lot to say about it but a lot of us will talk about that
i think the astronauts were very much a part of the design the development the requirements in this phase of the program
so they were very much a part of it
they weren't too much in favor of an automatic landing system
that's right
that was my next question
when does it appear clearly that the space shuttle was not a low cost access to space or was it already too late to change the program or requirements
i think the problem was that we never got up to flight rate
there were payloads waiting for us but we never got to flight rate
and if we had gotten to a higher flight rate operational costs would have been lower
not enough lower because no matter what we would do we never would have met our original estimates on operational costs
but as you saw by that inflation story that i had costs today would be enormously higher than that dollars ten million estimate that we had in one thousand nine hundred seventy just because of inflation
but we never got flight rate so we didn't ever get to the lower cost
and in the early days i wasn't there but it appears to me there was a lot of pressure to get that flight rate up so that the cost per flight would come down
and that pressure got to be instilled into the people at nasa and the industry to where the decision made on that cold day in january or whatever it was on the challenger
even though there was evidence that those o links had leaked in previous flights the decision was made to launch
now that is a management policy issue associated with trying to reduce the cost of flight
and so that was a bad decision
anything else
i will say one other thing on cost per flight
you have to realize when you're dealing with a reusable system it is hard to specify exactly what you even mean by the cost of the flight
you can take the total amount of money you spend on the shuttle program every year and divide that by the number of flights
well this year we only had one flight which came to a pretty high cost
and last year the cost was infinite
on the other hand you can look at what is the cost of flying six flights a year versus what is the cost of flying seven flights a year
and that is what you would call in economics the incremental cost of a flight
also you have to realize that in the cost of the flight there are an awful lot of things that are wrapped up
not just the cost of the shuttle itself but all of the mission operations the flight planning that has to be carried out
there was one flight a space lab flight i think back in the eighty s where they launched the space lab mission it was supposed to be a two week mission but they had fuel cell problem so they had to come back after four days
and in order to give the scientists the opportunity to get their flight data they rescheduled the flight for a few months later
so they had the same crew they had the same flight plan so they didn't have all of the expenses the paperwork expenses the training all of the re planning and the experiments were the same
it was the least expensive flight that we possibly could have run
and at the time the estimates were that that actually cost nasa probably about dollars one hundred twenty million
that was kind of the barebones estimate of the incremental cost of a shuttle flight
and then it can go from there all the way up to billions of dollars if you just take one flight a year like we have this year
well the other thought too i remember going up to see dale myers when he was associate administrator for manned space flight and i was the orbiter project manager
as he pointed out we had four computers
the original thought is if one computer went out on the ground we would lift off with three computers
and that's what we talked about
well of course that never happened
i mean not only that we have five computers now
we actually have a fifth computer which is a backup computer
so things change environments change and we were going to do very routine payloads
we were going to take it up launch a payload and come back down just very routine payloads
almost every payload today is different
and it does take that large amount of infrastructure to get that
one of the cost elements in our cost effectiveness study was a reduction in the cost of scientific payloads because we were going to have sort of a boilerplate bus
a heavy rugged bus that had power and communications
and the scientists would bring their experiments to this bus put it on this standard vehicle
take it into orbit launch or keep it depending on what the experiment was then bring it back
and we were going to have this standard bus that was going to be one of the big improvements in cost of the science payloads
so we showed a reduction in the cost of scientific activity in our cost effectiveness studies
that never happened
the science guys never could accept the idea of an independent bus
we could go on talking for a long time but it is the end of the class
let's thank dale myers again
thank you
i enjoyed it
so send me your bios and have a good weekend and see you next tuesday
there were a couple of areas that have been discussed a little bit which i wanted to elaborate on because i think it is significant
one of them relates to intact aborts
the question of a crew escape system and whether that should be automated whether the crew should have control and what is required if you actually have the crew take control
i think chris kraft gave an interesting perspective with the idea that because of the difficulties
or given the requirements really the impossibility of incorporating a capsule escape system for the shuttle the project basically took the point of view that the shuttle itself was the escape pod which means that you have to recover the shuttle intact regardless of any engine failures
now that of course requires one hundred percents reliability of the solid rocket boosters which we never did achieve with challenger
although of course had we operated it within its spec limits it might be another story
but in any case i want to go through some of the details of a return to launch site abort and then i will describe an incident which occurred on our last flight to give you an idea of what is involved in the actual operation of abort modes
the idea is you have the two solid rocket boosters which have to light
and they are going to perform no matter what
if one of those boosters doesn't light and the other does it is a bad day
what can you say
and obviously if one of them fails during flight it is a bad day
and which was more of a design problem if they don't tail off at just the identical rate so that you get asymmetric thrust greater than a certain capability of the shuttle to control you have had a bad day
and because of the requirement to have symmetric thrust i don't think if this was discussed before when the solid rocket boosters are poured they mix a batch of propellant sort of like you mix bread dough
and then they pour the propellant into both the left and the right booster segments at the same time so each booster segment has the identical batch of propellant in it
it may not be the same from the bottom to the top but it is the same from the left to the right
and that is critical
and then they always reserve a certain proportion of the propellant
and they do tests on that to make sure that there are no process control problems
ok
you still need the three main engines to have enough thrust
the boosters each give you about two point five million pounds thrust so that is about five million pounds to get off the ground
these give you about a half a million pound thrust at vacuum four hundred and some odd thousand pounds thrust so still over a million pounds thrust
and of course the problem you have during first stage is you have big gravity losses
the shuttle on the pad weighs about five point five million pounds with all the propellant
if you don't fire your main engines you are barely going to lift off the ground
actually i guess it is a little bit less than five million pounds
but in any case without the three main engines firing you don't have enough thrust to get into orbit
now remember we talked about for deorbit burn normally we fire both oms engines
if one of the oms engines is out you can fire one engine for twice as long
or if they are both out you can fire the four rcs thrusters for twice as long again
because you are in orbit you are weightless you don't have gravity losses so firing half as many engines for twice as long is completely equivalent
when you are taking off against gravity that is not true
i mean if you only have five million pounds of thrust for a five million pound payload you are just going to sit on the pad and burn all your fuel
ok
you need your three engines
and in fact another interesting point the attachment between the external tank and the shuttle that is stressed to assume that you have at least one engine burning
they tell me that if the shuttle took off with just the solid boosters and you didn't have any thrust sort of keeping the shuttle up with the external tank that the structural attachment points would fail
anyway you need your engines
what happens if you lose an engine early on
if you are far enough into the launch you are over the main gravity loss segment usually starting at about three point five to four minutes into launch
if you lose one engine you can make it over the ocean and that is called a trans atlantic abort
and when you do that you are basically flying upside down
you will do a roll maneuver drop your external tank and come in and land
and you are basically going in the same direction which is nice when you are flying a rocket
these things are hard to turn around
but if you are going to do a return to launch site abort that is exactly what you have to do
so this is a procedure that has been analyzed to death in many many computer simulations
the basic procedure is you take off and you lose an engine
now it doesn't matter when you lose an engine in the first two point five minutes
you don't do anything while the solid rocket boosters are firing
they basically have open loop guidance
there is a certain projector programmed in and you cannot readjust that trajectory with a closed loop guidance solution to accommodate for any sort of a malfunction
so you don't even declare an rtls abort
and that by the way is done by the crew punching a button which essentially is a protected button
you punch that
and you can also do it via a computer input if something goes wrong with the button
you declare an rtls abort after srb separation
immediately what happens is your trajectory increases because you want to gain altitude and you will see why in a minute
but what happens now is you've got a pretty hefty downrange velocity already and you have got to turn around and come back
you have also got to worry about the disposal of your external tank
if you turn around and you come back you are still burning your engines you are still riding your tank and you don't want the tank coming down on melbourne or disney world or anything like that
the basic procedure is as follows
you are going out you loft your trajectory a bit once you get far enough out now what you do is you do a powered pitch around
a very sporty maneuver
the external tank is here
now you are flying backwards into your plume and everybody has speculated on what that would actually look like
now you are flying backwards decelerating
and as you decelerate of course gravity is starting to push you down so you've got to increase your pitch velocity until finally you basically have no more horizontal velocity and are just sitting statically on top of your exhaust
and now you gradually pitch forward and you start to fly back
again you have got to plan your trajectory so that when you drop the tank it is going to come down in the ocean
and then if all that goes well now you enter the heading alignment circle
and of course you are a heavy weight vehicle because you also in the process of the rtls
dump your oms tanks and your rcs propellant so that you want to make sure you are as light as possible
plus in case you have any problem with landing you don't want your hypergolic propellant tanks to rupture
if all that goes well now you enter the heading alignment circle and you have hopefully a nominal landing
as i say this has been analyzed in high fidelity dynamic simulations
the crew practices it over and over again
everybody knows the procedures
nobody wants to be the first crew to try this out
before sts one you remember we talked about how there were lots of problems with the tiles falling off
i remember one of the people very high up in nasa i don't remember if it was the administrator or one of the deputies suggested that maybe the safest thing to do would be to do a planned rtls because an rtls of course you don't get up to those high velocities
and so you don't have any thermal problems
and so if a whole bunch of tiles had fallen off on the launch pad you could safely do an rtls
well obviously they did not appreciate the difficulties of doing an rtls and that suggestion was not taken up
we basically decided we were not going to fly until we had confidence that the tiles were going to stay on
cut forward to february of one thousand nine hundred ninety six which was my fifth and final shuttle flight
i was the second flight engineer so i was sitting right behind the pilot who is responsible for the main engine performance
now i should tell you we have had in the course of the one hundred fourteen shuttle flights we have had four pad shutdowns pad aborts
and i think we talked about that briefly
the main engines turn on six seconds before the solids
just reviewing that does two things
it gives the engines time to come up to full thrust and then you can perform checks on them to make sure that they are operating properly before you commit yourself to flight
and of course it gives time because of the asymmetric thrust for what we call the twang that the whole shuttle stack goes forward and then back
and then when you get to the vertical you light the boosters
in fact when they had the first test firing on the pad before sts one one of the reasons that they wanted to do that in addition to just confirming that everything was working right is they really wanted precise timing on the twang
people had calculated it but that is not something you want to get wrong
so they wanted an experimental verification
of the four pad shutdowns two of them were caused by instrumentation and two of them were real engine problems
i remember the first one was the last flight before what would have been my first flight back in one thousand nine hundred eighty four
and the main engine cutoff is called meco
so eight point five minutes into the flight
after they had a pad abort the flight engineer called to mission control we have meco somehow i thought we would be a little bit higher
and of course when that happens now you've got to pull all the engines out take them back to the shop bring in new engines and it is about a two or three week stand down
and the crew has to go back to houston
and of course all of your friends and family are there and they have to go home
it is no fun
i mean nobody complains if it is safe
we're sitting on the pad we're counting down and everything was on schedule
in fact the first of my five flights it had zero problems zero delays
we were going on the day that was predicted on the time
countdown to six seconds
you can feel the engines
everything starts to rumble
the engines start up
there is what we call a steam gage a vertical bar which shows the engine power
center and right engines come up to one hundred percents
the left engine comes up to forty percents
the pilot calls out left engine at forty percents
in times like this your mind is working pretty fast
i remember thinking to myself oh damn we are going to have a pad shutdown we have got to go back to houston and back to the simulators
i mean stupid things to be thinking about at that time but that is sort of the way it works
and all of a sudden kaboom
i feel this big kick in my back
the solids have lit
what in the hell is going on
we were supposed to have a pad abort
now we are going with an engine
and actually when you are going through maximum dynamic pressure max q the engines throttle down to about sixty five percents
and there is a malfunction if one of your engines gets stuck it is called getting stuck in the thrust bucket
if it doesn't come back to full power you are rtls abort
well we were taking off with one engine at forty percents
it sort of dawned on me that we were going to be the first crew to do an rtls so at that point i start going through my checklists
and the pilot calls to the ground we have ignition left engine at forty percents
and so for about the first fifteen seconds or so i just had barely time to get out the rtls checklist and start getting ready to read the procedures
and then it turns out that the ground has more insight than the crew does
and it turns out that there are several sensors one of which feeds that gauge
but in fact that sensor had gone bad
and in fact the left engine was performing nominally and the ground was able to confirm that both by the other sensors and by looking at the acceleration
and so everything was ok i put away the checklist and enjoyed the ride
but first of all it was kind of a scary situation
but it also shows the difficulty
now suppose we as the crew had been responsible for declaring an abort
if you are going to build in a system where this is the crew's responsibility then you better design your instrumentation so that the crew has all the instrumentation required to make that decision correctly
similarly if this were to be an automatic abort you've got to have failure detection identification reconfiguration
the last thing you want is to go into an abort situation when you don't have to because there is no way that an abort is going to be anywhere near as safe as a nominal mission
obviously it's just a good story now
but i think it does have something to inform about how you are going to have to design abort systems
and as both aaron cohen and chris kraft said although the astronauts always felt comfortable with their abort system but i am not sure that all the people in mission control were quite so comfortable knowing the things that might go wrong with it
and in fact as he said they always breathe a sigh of relief after first stage when the abort rocket would detach and fire itself away
yeah
if one of the engines is not working or not working properly i guess the other two engines try to do the work
well they certainly will throttle up to one hundred nine percents if they need to but they cannot make up for the first engine when you're in the first stage and you have lots of gravity losses
in fact when you get like i said to about three point five four minutes then you have enough altitude and downrange velocity to make it across
and then at some point you get to the situation where you basically gained your altitude
and although you are not at orbital velocity yet so you still have some gravity losses
the gravity losses are small enough that if you have a loss of an engine you can still make it to a lower orbit
that is called abort to orbit ato
and you will hear the call press to ato means that you can now make it to a lower orbit which is the safest thing to do with two engines
and then a little bit later on you will hear like single engine tal which means if you lose two engines with only one engine you can make it across the atlantic
and then later on you will hear single engine ato and then finally single engine
then you will also hear press to meco which means at this point if you lose an engine you can make it through your nominal orbit
and usually about the last call a single engine press to meco which means even if you lose two engines you can still make it to meco
what happens then if there is an instrumentation problem
the crew will never declare an abort on their own because it is just realized that the ground has so much more information
the only exception is if you lose comm
if we had lost comm
and we saw our engine at forty percents i mean there were a few other displays which the pilot was starting to call up
and it could be that he would have figured it out perhaps perhaps not but that is the only circumstance under which the crew would make that call
there was abort at some stage
what happened to that
did they manage to make it
i was trying to remember
did i talk about that in class
well all right i will run through that because it was again a very interesting story
the things that you are afraid about is that if things go back in a hurry in an engine that an engine can actually blow up
and it is one thing if an engine gets shutdown
now you are just flying on two engines
but if an engine blows up and takes out your whole rear section you have had a bad day
the instrumentation is biased towards an early shutdown
if you sense that something has gone wrong shut it down
we have got intact aborts
better to err on the side of safety even if that might potentially put you into an abort situation
and i am trying to exactly reconstruct it
the thing is that if you lose one engine now you are abort ato
now if you lose a second engine you might be in a situation where certainly you cannot make it to orbit
and because you have changed your trajectory you might not be able to make it to a good trans atlantic landing site
so at that point if you have lost one engine there is a switch on the center console where you can override the engine shutdown command
what you are now saying is we are in an unsurvivable situation if we only have one engine
and therefore we will take the extra chance of getting an instrumentation caused engine shutdown
we are not going to take that chance so we are going to disable the ability of instrumentation to shut down the engine and we will just take our chances
the ground will continue the calculation
and as soon as you get to the point where you have the capability of doing a single engine tal or a single engine abort to orbit you re enable the instrumentation
what happened is the shuttle launched
it must have been about four or five minutes into launch because they lost an engine it shut down automatically they are now abort to orbit lower orbit but they were abort to orbit
take the switch put it to inhibit
now the main propulsion flight controller was very good
she realized right away that it was an instrumentation problem because sometimes you can see certain trends or you see things change in a way that tells you that this is not the way a real engine behaves that this is more typical of instrumentation
she suspected she had an instrumentation problem
now they get a little further along in the launch where they could have potentially done they were too far to land in the normal tal sites which were in the daytime on the west coast of africa but they could have made a nighttime landing at some emergency airport in the congo i think it was if they had lost another engine
but by the flight rules they take the switch back to enable so that now because you can safely lose a second engine you want to protect yourself against an explosive situation
so now they are enabled
now the flight controller sees that the instrumentation on one of the other two engines is starting to go back the way the first one was
and she realized that in about fifteen seconds that engine was going to shut down so she immediately called the flight director and said flight take the switch back to inhibit
and this is where the discipline becomes very important luckily flight didn't get into a long involved discussion about why do you want to do that what is going on but just said capcom engine switch to inhibit
they took it
and sure enough the instrumentation went bad but the engine was ok
they got to orbit
then they used some of their oms propellant to raise their orbit a little bit
that was a spacelab mission
and they had a good mission
but the flight controller actually won a big award for that because she really saved the day
so yeah that is the closest we ever came to a real intact abort
yeah
two questions
the first one is going back to the return to launch site
do all of the main engine propellant get used up before the tank gets dropped or do you not burn some of the propellant
you know i don't know the answer to that
i don't
and the other one is on the pad with your flight wouldn't the sequencing computer shut down the other engines if it detected that one of them had failed
and so it must have used the good sensor
yeah that is right
and luckily our little gauge was just fed by one
and in retrospect you can say probably that's not a good way to design it but that is the way it was designed
you're right
if the engine controller senses with a majority or however they program it i don't know the details of the guts of the software there
but if it is convinced that one of the engines is not working right it shuts down all three engines which is what happened on four occasions
yeah
when you talked about the forced pitch over in the return to launch site was that just the gambling of the main engines that gives you that
yeah because you are off the solids at that point
and that is the thing
i mean with the solids there is such an enormous thrust and the aerodynamic loads are huge
you don't want to deviate from your planned trajectory because one of the things that they do is program in load relief for the aerodynamic surfaces
they take the day of winds launch
and if you have wind shears or other atmospheric high jet streams that you are going to fly through they actually program the elevons and the body flap to move in such a way as to relieve the aerodynamic loading on the wings
and that is preprogrammed in
it is not a closed loop
it is totally open loop so you don't want to change the trajectory once you've put all that load relief in
how long does that take
it's pretty quick
it's about ten seconds if i remember from the simulator
it is a sporty maneuver i will tell you
no rcs that goes into that
oh the rcs is trivial compared to what you're getting out
you've got five hundred thousand pounds coming out of each engine
the primary rcs is seven hundred fifty pounds
but like i said they do then open up the rcs as you are flying back
and what they do is they open up all the engines so that you have symmetrical thrusts so that you are firing out of both sides
the idea is just to deplete the tanks as much as possible
the second technical area that i had been hoping that al louviere would get into and didn't have a chance to was the payload bay doors which are a fascinating mechanism
and it is also going to be a segue into eva because it was a strange situation
it is kind of relate back to that now when you look at how many successful evas have been done and the hubble repair and the building of space station and all the other things but management at johnson space center was not particularly friendly to eva back in the seventy s
i asked chris kraft about that
at first he denied it
he said well i always liked eva
he said well maybe it was the management of the astronaut office that didn't like eva
he did admit that bob gilruth who was the director of johnson space center at the time this was when chris kraft was head of flight operations definitely did not like eva
he was afraid of it
he didn't think it was safe despite the fact that back in one thousand nine hundred seventy three eva had saved the entire skylab project
hopefully most of you know that story
i know it is ancient history
and clearly we had done a lot of safe evas on the surface of the moon but basically eva was looked at it was expensive it was potentially hazardous
given the things that the shuttle was supposed to do in the original planning mainly launch satellites launch pieces of the space station that went away launch defense department satellites commercial satellites eva was not really part of the big picture in planning
and although they did design an airlock for the shuttle there were real questions of how much preparation do we have to do for eva
do we really even need it
maybe we could save some weight by not having space suits aboard
that is where we finally ended up
that is the hubble telescope
this is the side of the payload bay
i mean obviously eva became a very successful activity
these are the payload bay doors
this is in the orbiter processing facility
and one of the things well i have a picture of closing the door
but the mechanism of these doors is extraordinary
there are two motors one at the front and one at the back of each
each of the motors has two drive units and they work through a differential so that if one of the motors fails the other one can still drive although at half the speed just similar to the way a car works
there is a long torsion rod which runs the length of the shuttle
and then that torsion rod is attached to these bars over here
and i am sorry the picture was scanned in and is not terribly sharp
as the torsion bar twists then these rods lift up the payload bay door and bring it to a close
the mechanism this is the best picture i could find you notice there is a strong back because as was mentioned the doors cannot support their own weight in one g
but the system of latches here you have to remember that the payload bay can expand and contract by several inches due to thermal environment
and so you have to design a latch system that can accommodate this thermal behavior
it was an incredible mechanical challenge
and the complexity of this system i mean i am always amazed when i look at how the thing works
i have a schematic of them later which you can look at but basically you close the doors
and then the first thing you do is you want to close the latches on either end
and then there is also center line latches
and i think al louviere did discuss the fact that these payload bay doors are part of the structural element of the shuttle during reentry
you cannot reenter if the doors are not just closed by latched
you need them latched for structural strength
there is a series of bollards here little protrusions which these latches grab on
and they have designed the rigging of the rods such that the latches that are close to the hinge line actually close before the latches that are further away
it is a sequential closing of the latches all with a single mechanism so that basically you pull the part of the door that is closest to the torque rod you latch that down first and then it is kind of a zipper effect where then you pull it down so that even if the door is a little bit warped thermally you will get the door to close properly
you wouldn't want to close this latch first and then have the door in a situation where it was buckled out
and then of course the center line latch because of the thermal expansion you can have the doors coming together like that or like that
and you have got to have centerline latches that can accommodate for that
it is really quite an incredible design
and al louviere had said that he was going to talk about it but he didn't have time to
there is plenty of redundancy in here because there are these double motors but because this is so critical people started to look at suppose you have some degree stuck in the mechanism it doesn't matter how many motors you cannot get it closed
suppose the motors jam on one side
now the other motor is not going to be able to drive it
so various things were done to allow for eva intervention
and in the early shuttle flights this was the only thing that the crew trained for with eva it was just payload bay door contingencies
for instance the pdu the drive unit this is the payload bay door drive unit or plbdu
that is what we call a nested acronym
that is part of the game there
you have to go out and actually peel away the liners of the payload bay
and inside here there is a little mechanism where you can insert a special tool and twist it
and that actually disconnects that motor drive unit from the torque so that it can turn freely
and i hope when you look at these things you will get some sense of the complexity of these mechanisms
and so what we do for training of course they build mockups of this in the water and we also look at the real shuttle down in florida to actually see these units
and for the people who are on the eva crew you spend a lot of time crawling around the payload bay getting intimately familiar with a lot of the actual mechanisms just in case you actually have to go out and do something with it
then suppose the problem is not with the drive unit but that one of these latches get jammed up
this is actually a tube cutter
it is a little hard to see
i don't know if you are familiar with the things
they are on a ratchet
and as it gradually cuts you push the blade in bit by bit
and then eventually you cut away
and this gives you an idea that they just gave us a lot of tools a pin extractor a crowbar vice grips you name it
how much did that crowbar cost
well the crowbar probably cost about dollars ten at sears
and then they had to put on all of the velcro and the tethers to go in the tool thing and that probably cost a few hundred dollars
and then they had to make a drawing of it and you know how it goes
eva is very expensive because everything has to be custom made
i mean that is one of the things that because of the constraints of the suits and the gloves you cannot in most case just use regular tools
and as i say everything is tethered
and i will show you pictures later
we have a little mini workstation
they built little receptacles on the side of the suit because it is a hard upper torso which can take a certain amount of load
and so you plug basically a tool caddy into your suit
and then you hang all of these tools on the tool caddy
and you will see some pictures later of how that works
if the motors don't work and you have now freed the doors so that the door can move but you have no motor to drive it now we have a mechanical winch and a rope on it
and i'm not making this up
you actually run the rope up
these are the little bollards that the latches catch onto
you run the rope up over that and then you have to crawl out on the payload bay door which would be a lot of fun and attach it here
and then you actually wind it closed
and we do this in the water
i mean this is all fully mocked up
yeah
what do you do if you have trouble opening the doors just after launch
well if you cannot open the doors then you come home
you wouldn't want to
i mean if there was something seriously wrong with the doors you better come home
yeah we can do this to get them closed
but you don't want to purposely put yourself in that situation if you know you have a problem beforehand
yeah
we think it could be done with one person
normally we only go out with two
but in the orbital flight test the first four flights only had two crew members
was of them was eva trained
and then what happens if you get the doors closed by the latches don't latch
they actually made latches that we could put on by hand
these are the latches for the side
and this is the schematic that sort of show the latches going on the orders in that order one two three and four
and again the way they designed this so that they actually close in sequence but you only have one drive unit is really just a beautiful mechanical system
but if they don't close then you take this and i won't go into the details but you have to spring it around at least two of those
and that will give you the structural strength to come home
and then if the center line latches don't close again you can look at the mechanism here
and they have yet a different tool
now this is actually shown on its side but this is actually on the top
and this is a bitch in the water because yeah your suit is weightless but the tool is not
and so you are holding this tool
when you're holding the tool you want to sink to the bottom and so you are trying to hold on with one hand
and you have a tether so you try to tie yourself to the top there so that you're kind of hanging on the tether
but then depending on how your weigh out is if you move this big tool back and forth your body is sort of rocking back and forth
and you are working above your head
i mean everybody has to do it
if you are going to be an eva crew member and you cannot do this job you are disqualified
but nobody likes it
it is a real pain
that is basically how eva got sold to the shuttle system
i will show you a few pictures of general eva activities to give you an idea of how the system works
and then i want to go into the question of the interaction between eva and the pressurization and the environmental control system of the rest of the shuttle because again this is a systems engineering problem
and you cannot in most cases do one thing without it having an impact on something else
i talked about doing all this training
now we are stepping ten years into the future so that is training for the hubble telescope
and actually the telescope is so tall that we couldn't get the whole thing in
the pool wasn't deep enough so we had to actually cut it in half and we would work on one half and then work on the other half
here is an example
this is me installing the wide field planetary camera
now the training people normally see the water tank
you're not weightless
you all understand that
if you go upside down the blood rushes to your head
if you're holding onto tools the tools will fall down
and of course you don't have these guys when you're out in space
angels if you saw them out in space
if you're moving around large objects they have resistance from the water so you need to get a sense of how easy it is to push things around so you don't get things moving too fast
we also train on air bearing floors
this is a mass model of the wiff pick
the same mass moments of inertia
and i am up here on a weight relief system
and you can really get a sense of what it feels like
and so you are trying to build a kind of muscle memory so that when you get in space you are not trying to push things as hard as you push them in the water
and you also remember that if you want to stop something you also have to be able to exert a force on it
whereas in the water all you have to do is stop pushing
now we go into space and we are ready for the eva
i will sort of take you through what is involved to give you a sense of the complexity of this system
first of all are tools
that is what i looked like before all the cosmic rays made my hair fall out
it is just one of the hazards of spaceflight
here you see the kind of tool caddies
this is for a ratchet wrench
and we had about two hundred fifty different tools
about a hundred planned to use and the rest were for contingencies
and we had to take them all out
we call this our fish stringer
sort of like a portuguese fishermen
the fisher wives hang all the fish on the string and then hang them out
and then we take this out on the fish stringer
this is the airlock at launch
and it is totally packed
and in fact we had four spacesuits rather than the normal two so there wasn't a whole lot of room
and the first thing is you go and you start checking the various systems
and then you have to unpack everything and move it into the flight deck
that is story
we went out together
this is the hard upper torso
this is looking down into the inside of the spacesuit
the back of the spacesuit there is battery and lithium hydroxide co two scrubber
the co two scrubber has to be replaced after every eva
it is good for about twelve hours
and normally if you're only going out once you don't worry about recharging the batteries
but since we were doing successive every day evas we would have to take the batteries out every night and charge them
take the ones that had been charged and put them into the suits that are going to go out the next day
and just keeping track of which cartridges have been used and which batteries have been charged and how much i mean there is a tremendous amount of overhead effort just in managing all of this equipment
and we had practiced doing this a lot on the ground as you can imagine before we went up
the morning of the eva
you get up early and eat as big a breakfast as you can because you are not going to get much to eat for the next eight hours
these are radiation monitors
for hubble we were actually up at about six hundred kilometers which is as high as the shuttle ever goes so we got really the highest radiation dose that you can get on the shuttle on a normal mission
it was about between one and two rems which is no big health problem
but typically the dose on a shuttle flight at a more typical three hundred kilometers is more like tens or maybe a little over one hundred millirems
they did want us to take the radiation monitor
now we are in the mid deck
and when you see these pictures you get a sense of when you're doing an eva the entire middeck is just full of stuff
i mean there is so much equipment
you've got the pants units floating over there plus the two extra suits and all of the auxiliary equipment
you try to keep things organized
then for thermal control the original apollo spacesuits were designed for daytime use on the moon when it is very hot
and in addition people are walking so they are putting a lot of metabolic heat into the suit
and so they were very concerned about being able to have sufficient cooling
they developed a very very efficient sublimator cooling unit
you have a little layer of ice that is continually fed from the bottom and it is sublimates
that basically is how you get rid of your heat
and then you run your cooling water underneath that ice and it cools off
and then it is run through what they call lcvg liquid cooling and ventilation garment which has lots of tygon tubing that goes through it so that it carries the cold water next to your skin
and also the oxygen that comes into the suit comes through the helmet over the back of your head so it flows over your face so you breathe the fresh oxygen
but you would like to get ventilation through the entire suit so you don't build up lots of humidity in your arms and legs
what you do is the return valve actually comes through these air ducts
and so the return is picked up at the bottom of your arms and at the bottom of your legs
that insures that the air does get circulated through your arms and legs
but when we started doing shuttle evas metabolically you are not nearly as stressed
plus you spend almost half your time in the dark and it gets really really cold
and this has been a constant problem
and here is an interesting systems problem to show how everything relates to one another
we were very concerned about when you open up the doors of the hubble telescope if direct sunlight comes in it will cause an out gassing of the internal material which could pollute the ultraviolet mirrors
the ultraviolet optics are very very sensitive to organic contamination so under no circumstances could we have sunlight penetrating the interior of the telescope
but we were going to be spending a lot of time with the doors open so how do you insure that you will never get the sun coming in
well the hubble telescope is sitting up here like this
if that is the sun just make sure that the belly of the orbiter is always pointed towards the sun
then you never have to worry about sun coming into the telescope
but what you do have to worry about is that well during the dayside of your orbit if the sun is over here and the earth is over here during the day your payload bay is going to be pointed towards the earth
and so you basically have a radiative heat exchange with something that is at about twenty degrees c
no big deal
if you go around the other side now you at nighttime you're pointed at deep space
and so you're radiating towards absolute zero or three degrees kelvin
and that is a concern
and you get very cold
they were predicting temperatures of as much as one hundred fifty below zero celsius
we were very concerned not only were our hands going to get cold but some of our tools might not work
we pushed very hard for a test in a thermal vacuum chamber
our tools are stored in a toolbox outside in the cargo bay
and we wanted to go through going out and taking the tools out
and of course they are held in there because they have launch locks so there are little pit pins and latching mechanisms that you have to remove so that you can get the tools out
i went in to do the first test
and it is a vacuum chamber
and the walls are painted black
and they can run liquid nitrogen through the vacuum chamber
and they could cool it down to the lowest temperatures that we were expecting to experience
i opened up the toolbox and about seventy five percents of the tools the launch release mechanisms were just frozen shut
i couldn't get them out
so that started to get people's attention
they sent the engineers in to redo some of the tolerance
they played around with the lubrication a little bit
then story went in a week later to do his run and he was able to get most of the tools out
i think he got all the tools out actually because i was only in for a few hours
because once we realized that it wasn't working i came out
he was in there
i remember he said at one point just holding onto these tools my hands are really really cold
i don't know
about an hour or so later someone asked him how his hands were
he said oh they are fine they've warmed up
well story is from the south
those of you with experience in winter know that if your hands are really cold and after a while you don't feel them anymore it doesn't necessarily mean that they have warmed up
when they took him out of the chamber his hands were deep purplish black and he had severe frostbite to the point where they sent him up to alaska to some frostbite specialists
in the end he was very fortunate
he got off with no major permanent damage and was able to fly
but as you can imagine that got serious management attention
so gloves now have electrical heating units in them
but we didn't have that available
what we had to do was to change the attitude profile so that we were basically pointing towards the earth
now that is generally ok
if you are pointing towards the earth and the sun is coming from your belly you are not going to hurt the shuttle but a quarter way around the earth you do have the possibility now that the sun is going to hit the telescope
what they had to do was to do two attitude maneuvers every orbit in order to basically keep us in a more benign thermal attitude for the eva
but to prevent the sun from shinning on the telescope
and we didn't the reaction control system propellant budget to support that
remember we were going into a high orbit which meant we needed to use a lot of oms fuel to get up there
and we needed a lot of propellant for the deorbit because the higher you are the more you have to burn to get down
and so the flight control community together with the pilots got together and developed a special way that we could do maneuvers using only half the number of jets that you normally use
and so this is an interconnection between the thermal environment of eva and the reaction control propellant budget which nobody in the early days of flight planning would ever have believed that there is this sort of connection
but it is just another good example of how these systems all play with one another and you cannot make changes in one without another
i am going to finish this unit and then we will take a little break and then i will do the last part
the process of getting in the suit
first you get in lta lower torso assembly basically the pants
and of course this is one time when you can put your pants on both legs at a time
you cannot do that too often
but again look at the middeck here
it is full
this by the way is the escape pole
we talked about this earlier
during launch and entry it is actually bolted into position so that it will take you out the door but once you are in orbit you just sort of float it up and out of the way and it just kind of velcroed to the ceiling
and of course it has no weight up there so it is perfectly happy
you get in the pants
now the upper torso of the suit is attached to the wall inside the airlock
now you have to float into the airlock
and that is what you're looking at when you're getting into the suit
there are a lot of connections you have to make
this is the water bag
this is the comm connection for your snoopy cap
this is the water and air connection which you have to hook into your lcbg
and these are the arms that you have to get into
and the problem in the design here is your shoulders are wider than your chest
when you are actually inside the suit you want the distance between these two arms to be conformal with your armpits
because if it is out here that cuts way down on your mobility
but if it is too narrow you cannot get into it
that is the basic design problem in this sort of a suit
now the russians have a rear entry suit that doesn't have that problem
it is always a challenge and you really have to push and struggle to get in
eventually they wanted to design this suit so that one person could get in by themselves but it cannot be done
i mean you can get in like this but you just cannot pull up the waist ring and attach it by yourself
nobody has been able to do that
it is a great feeling of accomplishment when you finally get inside
then you put your helmet on
now you're starting to see what we are dealing with because we have to take all this stuff outside in addition to the tools that are already outside
these are the plugs which we put the mini work station
we haven't put it on quite yet but it is just a whole bunch of equipment which you have to manage
at this point we purge the suit with an oxygen flow
now remember we are at an atmospheric pressure or almost an atmospheric pressure i will get into that later of pure oxygen so that also puts very serious flammability constraints
although when you go outside you are only at four psi
when you are inside here you are at the full cabin pressure
actually in order to do your leap check you have to go to four psi above cabin pressure
you are actually working at above one atmosphere of pressure of pure oxygen so that is a very serious flammability design constraint
and we have to sit and breathe pure oxygen then for about forty minutes to get the nitrogen out of our blood
and again i will be discussing this whole atmospheric and bends problem
but if you don't when you drop down to four psi the nitrogen in your blood bubbles out and you get the bends just like a diver who comes up too fast from a dive
just one or two pictures of what went on outside
there is hubble
i was changing some fuels there
it was kind of neat working underneath the solar panel
those were the old ones which we took off and replaced the next day
but you have to be really careful because you don't want to bang against it
and of course you cannot see above your head so we always have other people looking at us
this is the kind of situation where if you had a little heads up display where you could get this sort of a view to show what you're really doing it would really improve your situational awareness
but at the moment we don't have that
it takes not just the people outside but the people inside paying full attention reading procedures
historically we carried all of our procedures on a cuff checklist like so
but the procedures for hubble and some of the other flights are so complex that you just cannot do it
so nowadays these are just emergency procedures
i will pass this around
i would like it back
let's see
after putting in the new wiff pick ground had to do some tests on it so i got claude to fly me out over the arm
and we had one of the old lunar hasselblad cameras which they let us carry
normally we just use nikons on the shuttle but they let us take a hasselblad
that gives a view of what the payload bay looks like eva
here is story over here working on one of the other things
the earth is not flat don't worry about the picture
i went around it many times
and i mean some parts of eva i really should share it because it just gets really spectacular
this is about fifty feet i don't know whether to say above or below or whatever of the shuttle but you're just out there in the middle of nowhere
and at this point i was the free floater
one of the people is always attached to the end of the arm which is good when you have to move around big pieces of equipment because now you can react the forces with your feet
when you are a free floater either you're in a foot restraint which limits your mobility or one hand has to actually be holding you so that you can react forces
of course we are attached by a waste tether which is then attached to a long real of stainless steel
but you can set it so that the springiness is taken out
and so i could basically and i did from time to time must sort of let go
and it is a really neat feeling because once you convince yourself that you're not going to fall down which i'm enough of a physicist to understand the orbital mechanics but nevertheless the first time i let go it was an interesting feeling
the thing is when you're holding onto something whether by your feet or your hands of course the shuttle is so much more massive that you feel yourself physically related
you are controlled by the shuttle
and so the shuttle is your point of reference
maybe the shuttle is in orbit but you are attached to the shuttle
as soon as i let go the physics totally changes
and it was really this transformation into being a human satellite
i mean i really felt like i was a satellite now
i wasn't attached to the shuttle
and sometimes if i could turn around before i let go so i didn't see the shuttle it was really kind of neat especially at night just sort of floating there and all the stars and everything
yeah
do they build in time for you to be able to kind of do that kind of thing
no they don't build in the time
but like in this case two days before on story's and my last eva we had replaced not replaced
these are the magnetometers up at the top
the gross maneuvering of hubble is done by reaction wheels but the reaction wheels
when they get spinning too fast you have to be able to desaturate them so they have magnetic torquers these long torque rods which create a magnetic field
there are no jets on hubble because it would cause pollution of the optics so you need magnetometers up at the top to sense the magnetic field in order to operate the torquers
the magnetometers were never designed to be replaced
they weren't supposed to fail
well both of them failed in the first couple of years
we couldn't take them off so they designed two new magnetometers that we could actually insert and bolt on on top of the old ones
and then we took the electrical and data connections and hooked them up
but i noticed on that day we were very concerned with quality control
first of all that we didn't break anything that wasn't already broken but also to look for any signs of damage because you know this was a telescope that was supposed to be maintained
we saw a little bit of paint chipping off the outside of the old magnetometers
they were concerned that they might float around and get into the optics
we went into the payload bay the next day the other eva team and they cut off some of this gold insulation material from one of the thermal enclosures that some of the equipment was in
and i'm not supposed to stand in front
i keep forgetting that
we made those covers and then we had to go up and install them
but actually after we installed them then the ground wanted photographic documentation
we took pictures
and then the crew inside got their telephoto lenses and they took a lot of pictures
and then they got the television camera on the end of the arm to take pictures
and so during all that time you do have a little bit of free time just to sort of enjoy the environment
it would be a shame not to because it is such a spectacular place
yeah
how do you work when there is not light when you're on the dark side
let me turn the laser pointer on here
oh no what did i do
that is a good time for a break right
take a two minute break
and then of course when the sun rises you know it so you can turn your lights off
ok
i talked about the necessity of doing a nitrogen purge and pre breathing oxygen to get the nitrogen out of your blood
this turns out to be an interesting systems problem because it doesn't just affect the suit it affects the spacecraft
those of you who were here at the beginning saw i was blowing up a balloon which unfortunately popped
it was only to make the point that you can look at a spacesuit the arms and legs cylindrical
it is like one of those balloons
and when you try to bend the balloon it doesn't like to stay bent because you are compressing the gas and you're doing elastic work on the material of the balloon and it wants to snap back
and spacesuits basically work the same way
the old fashioned pressure suits that test pilots used to wear which were the genesis of the original mercury suits they basically stiffen you
and in fact the launch entry suits that we use on the shuttle are not designed for joint mobility
they are just pressurized
and we do a pressure check before the mission when we're getting suited up
and they blow it up and you just go like that
you can move a little bit you know enough so that if you're sitting in your seat with a seatbelt holding you in form so that your waist is bent you can move your arms enough to get to the controls
but i certainly wouldn't want to try and go out and do any useful work in that
it has really been an extraordinary design process that people have been able to develop spacesuits with articulating joints
i mean it is certainly not like walking around and doing things just with your body but it is amazing how flexible spacesuits are
and it is a continual challenge to develop particularly for the gloves
and when we get back to the moon to have legs that can actually walk in so that you don't have to hop around all the time
although there are times when that is good too
but in any case the stiffness of the suit because it turns out that most of the stiffness comes from compressing the gas you want to try first of all to build articulated joints that don't change their volume
and actually people have designed metallic suits that look like robby the robot
so they truly are zero delta volume suits
the problem is they are very heavy and there are other problems with metallic suits
and i don't have time to go into that
given that you're going to have some volume change the amount of work that you do is thermodynamically pressure times volume
you are going to have a delta v
you want to reduce the pressure
the lower your suit pressure the easier it is to bend
basically you don't want to fill your suit with any gas that you don't really need
we certainly don't need nitrogen to stay alive not on a short term basis so we fill the suit with oxygen
and we run it at about four point three psi for the shuttle
this is just historically mercury gemini and apollo the suit pressure was a little bit lower
doctors felt after doing calculations what you're really interested in is the partial pressure of oxygen in your blood
and they wanted a little bit more margin
since the shuttle was supposed to be operational this and operational that they wanted a little bit more margin
and so we bumped up the suit pressure a little bit
mercury gemini and apollo cabin was one hundred percents oxygen at the same pressure so that you didn't have to worry about pre breathing
in skylab it was not pure oxygen but it was a high enough oxygen that again they didn't have to worry about pre breathe
it wasn't until we went to the shuttle which typically the shuttle is at fourteen point seven or one hundred kilopascals normal atmospheric pressure
if we know we are going to be doing a lot of evas and i will talk about this later
what we do is we drop the overall cabin pressure but we keep the partial pressure of oxygen the same so you end up bumping up the oxygen concentration
we don't do that with the iss
the decision was made by the life scientists that since they wanted to study biology on the space station and all of our database is at one atmosphere that if they took the space station down to ten point two psi basically it would invalidate all of their life science research
so the station was only designed for one atmosphere
the operational people when they started to talk about how much eva was going to be involved in building and maintaining the space station the astronauts said this is crazy
and you will see the impact of this later
this is just looking in the future
these are decisions that are going have to be made for future space systems and they are looking at a lower working pressure
and you will see why as i go through this presentation
i think i'm not going to go through those charts
again this is a system
so you are affecting a great many different things
let's see
which is the laser here
there we go
one of the interesting things here with eva just like in any ecls system is that the human body becomes one of your subsystems that you have to take care of
and in many cases we don't have a whole lot of design flexibility with our bodies because they come predesigned
so we have to deal with that
we have all of the physiology the bends
materials
i talked about flammability in a pure oxygen environment
i talked about the constraints of microgravity and partial gravity physiology studies in the iss
of course nasa has decided that we don't need to do that anymore
and i guess our international partners are still going to want to do this
in any case the station is designed
the cooling we talked about i think in the ecla section lecture the fact that if you drop your cabin pressure now you've got to pump more air for all the air cooled things
and if you really want a design for a variable cabin pressure then that flows over into the cooling requirements more water cooling different fan requirements and so on
and it goes on
if you are going to do multiple evas what you're really interested in when you're looking at efficiency is what we call eva work efficiency index
it is the total amount of time involved in preparing for and carrying out an eva the ratio of that to the actual useful working time you get outside
and the more time you have to spend breathing pure oxygen to denitrogenate your blood that is taking away from your overall work efficiency
when we do tests on the ground and we start out at normal sea level pressure and we want to go down to four point three psi pure oxygen we actually have to do a four hour nitrogen purge
we have to just sit in the suit or stand in the suit for four hours this is in the eva test chambers before we actually can go down to pressure
if you want to get an eight hour work day of eva that is just unacceptable
and that is why they made the decision to lower the shuttle's cabin pressure
then you only have to do about a forty minute eva
and i have some of the specific numbers on that later
as i say just the review here is that we do have this capability on the shuttle
we don't have it on the station
they have figured out a few ways to make the denitrogenation process a little bit more efficient on the station but it is still a big overhead hit
and we are very concerned for the future because eva is not just an afterthought when you're going to be exploring on the moon or mars
you are going there basically to do eva
otherwise why bother
we have got to deal with this
here is the basic physiology that we are dealing with
oxygen percentage on the abscissa total pressure on the ordinate and all different units
millimeters of mercury psi and i think now people use kilopascals which i don't really relate to
but i know about one hundred kilopascals is about one atmosphere so luckily that makes it easy
normally we are at one atmosphere twenty percents or twenty one percents oxygen we are up here and this is the normal sea level equivalent
you start dropping the pressure and you have to increase the percentage of oxygen
there is a maximum level of breathing oxygen at pressure oxygen toxicity because oxygen is almost totally absorbed through your alveoli
and normally our alveoli stay inflated because we have eighty percents nitrogen which is only very reluctantly absorbed
i mean it does get through that is how it gets into our blood and so on but it is a much slower transport
but oxygen gets right through
and if you breathe pure oxygen for a long time you can really hurt your lungs and it can be lethal at a certain point
we actually don't have any good physiological data
i was down in houston last week at a big eva conference
that is why we didn't have class on tuesday
they were talking about what about long term planetary evas even at four psi pure oxygen is that going to be harmful to health
we honestly don't know
i mean that is an active area which needs research
on the other side of course you get into hypoxia which you have all heard of
you get it when you go up on mount everest and so on
so you've got a boundary that you have to work in
now this is sort of where things have fallen
the blue line is the hypoxic boundary
the green line is normal oxygen
when we were using pure oxygen spacecraft environments we were well above that
you would like to stay as close as possible
with shuttle eva we moved a little bit closer to hypoxic but we're still in a physiologically perfectly reasonable environment
decompression sickness just a quick review
any scuba divers here
you are all familiar with this
there are various levels of decompression sickness anywhere from just a mild tingling of the skin to joint pain to phase three dcs where you get central nervous system impairment which can actually cause death so you don't want to mess around with it
people refer to this famous r value
you run into this all the time
what you are really interested in is what is the ratio between the actual partial pressure of nitrogen in your blood compared to your suit pressure
and this over here shows this r value
if you are down at one the nitrogen isn't going to bubble out at all so you have no incidence of bends
vge venous gas emboli
and then as the r value increases the dotted line gas emboli that just means you have bubbles forming
dcs means actual symptoms of bends
and then grade three dcs which is very serious indeed
the way they make these measurements they have these large physiological studies where they actually get people to volunteer to go through these pumped down protocols
and then they actually put sensitive microphones and ultrasound things that can actually hear the bubbles as they move around your veins
i have never been able to figure out why anybody would volunteer for these experiments
i take my hat off to them
because the only way you build up this data is that some people actually do get the bends from these experiments
and of course they have hyperbaric chambers which as soon as there are any symptoms they put them right into the chamber and pump them to pressure and it goes away
and i don't think that they have lost any volunteers
like i say that is not something i am going to volunteer for
other factors this is something that becomes important
it turns out that the amount of time you spend at reduced pressure is important
also exercise
it turns out that the more you exercise maybe it makes sense you're moving your joints around but the bubbles come out
actually what they have started to do on the space station since we cannot go to a reduced cabin that while they are breathing oxygen for the first hour or so they do very exhaustive exercise both upper and lower body on an exercise bike with arm exercise as well
to try to drive away as much of the oxygen early on in the decompression preparation as you can
ok
where does that put us
as i said the more nitrogen you have in your blood to start out with the longer a pre breathe you are going to have to do before you can go out
these are the normoxic and hypoxic lines which i showed you before
and then these are the contours of the amount of time you have to pre breathe
remember i told you if you are at one atmosphere twenty percents oxygen your pre breathe time is two hundred forty minutes four hours
this is to get yourself down to an r value of one point sixty five
this is not one hundred percents safe because remember at one point sixty five there still is a twenty five percents incidence of dcs
now the interesting thing these are the statistics that come from the laboratory trials we have never had a reported case of bends during evas
and people are not quite sure why
some people suspect that maybe even if an astronaut is getting joint pain they are not going to report it because maybe that would prevent you from doing another eva
i mean there are enough other pains that you undergo in just using a spacesuit that maybe you don't even notice it
you feel a problem in your joints or your fingers and you say oh damn my gloves don't fit right or something like that
i have another slide mentioning this later
there is some suspicion that weightlessness may have an impact which means that the bends susceptibility on the moon or on mars may actually be greater than it is in weightlessness
we just don't know
here is where we have gotten to on the shuttle eva
again this is no pre breathe this is one hour pre breathe so we are at about forty minutes on the shuttle
that is where we are
now this is a design problem
how are we going to design the cev
how are we going to design the equipment the habitats that we are going to use on the moon and mars
now we're talking about surface exploration
and as i said there is a lot of uncertainty about the affect of gravity
but we suspect that it may be more bends inducing than weightlessness
and so what they are doing for safety and conservatism is instead of using the r value of one point sixty five which we use on the shuttle they are taking it down to about one point three one point four
now what does that do
here is one point four one point three
where does that put the shuttle eva we now would have to get down to that r value
we have got a two hour pre breathe
to get down to one point three we have got a two point five hour pre breathe
and this is with the normal spacesuit at four point three psi
we are heading an operational problem
if you want to go out on your geology traverse on the moon you have got to depressurize denitrogenate for two point two five hours
i don't think so
but what are we going to do
well if you increase the suit pressure now the r value at a given level of nitrogen goes down
and so at six psi even for an r of one point three you are in the zero pre breathe range which would be great
people have suggested well maybe we should build a variable pressure suit so that you could go out at six psi sort of get things set up
and then all that time counts towards your denitrogenation so maybe then after two hours into your eva now you can drop your pressure
and now if you have any things where you need more dexterity you will be ok
but the pressure control system in a spacesuit is a very complex undertaking
the russians do have a dual pressure suit
they never used the lower pressure to my knowledge
and it is a big hit to try to design this into the suit
and of course to design a suit to operate at a higher pressure
the russians work at about five psi but it means your suit is less flexible heavier and is just going the opposite direction from the desire to accomplish useful work which is why you are putting on the spacesuit in the first place
this is what we are working against
again we have got a systems problem
it is not just the pressure
it is the oxygen
in skylab in apollo because you were working in a pure oxygen environment now of course we're talking about what is the pressure going to be in the cabin
you want to keep the cabin at a higher oxygen environment
your material selection is highly limited
as it says they tended to use a lot of metallic materials
well what do we know about metals
particularly aluminum
first of all aluminum will burn at one hundred percents oxygen
but your cabin even if it is not one hundred percents oxygen you are going to have a lot of metallic material
well metal when you're dealing with radiation you hit metal aluminum or even higher atomic number metals with primary cosmic rays and you get spallation
you produce a lot of secondary particles
and you end up with actually more radiation than you would have gotten if you had just gotten hit by the incident cosmic ray
what you really prefer is to have low atomic number
hydrogen is best
water hydrogen oxygen and so forth
if you are forced to increase the metallic content of your spacecraft because of the oxygen flammability problems now you are going in the wrong direction for radiation protection which becomes an issue when you're dealing with long duration stays on the moon interplanetary transport and so on
so it is all interrelated
you cannot change one thing without changing the other
flammability
well we have been talking about that
i won't stay on that
but again it is very dependent on oxygen
oxygen restricts the use of non metallic materials
but nonmetallic materials are what we would like to use from a radiation point of view
you would like to have a lot of hydrocarbons you know polyethylene plastic in your spacecraft because they absorb cosmic rays
but in any case it is pretty well agreed that we never want to go above thirty percents oxygen
it just becomes too restrictive on the types of materials we can use
that is going to be a design constraint
and remember we are aiming towards a systems level design of our long duration space habitats which are eva compatible thirty percents oxygen
now we are back to this
now we can draw a red line
and we have got to stay on the left of that line
we have got to stay above the blue hypoxic line
now also remember that we have got these pre breathe lines
let's say we are going to limit pre breathe to no more than one hour
well we are cutting down on our design space here
we have got the oxygen flammability which is cutting off to the right
we have got the hypoxic limit which is cutting off in this direction
and we have got the pre breathe limit which is cutting off there
we are kind of in a i won't call it a box a rather small triangle
now if we go to a six psi spacesuit as i said we open up the design space a lot
but at a price of flexibility maneuverability and the ability to do the things that we want to do in the first place
where are we going to go with this
as i say it is an active area of research
i cannot tell you what the answer is going to be but it looks like they are going to probably be going for eight to nine psi with an oxygen concentration approaching thirty percents
and that the cev from what i have been told is most likely going to be designed with a variable pressure capability because it also has to be able to dock with the space station which means it has to be able to take one atmosphere
and also because the cev by itself is not going to have an airlock if you would have to do an emergency eva out of the cev for whatever reason you are going to have to depressurize like we did back in the gemini days or apollo
and of course that is going to affect the design of all the other systems on the cev because they will have to be able to operate from a vacuum all the way up to one atmosphere
just in the end i hope what you have gotten out of this is again we are trying to look at things from a systems engineering point of view
and this is one big system where eva cannot be considered just on its own
i gave an example of how it affects the rcs system with hubble
here it affects the environmental control life support
flammability radiation protection it is all linked together
this was the recommendation that we came out with slightly below nine psi pushing thirty percents
but as i said there is a lot of research that has to be done to understand the way bends behave at partial gravity
how we are going to do that
i have no idea
as i said for the international space station we have to be able to go up to regular atmosphere
we were making this presentation as part of the study we were doing last year on cev
but it was so relevant to what we did here that i didn't see any point in modifying it for this class
but we had to make these decisions on the shuttle based on similar calculations looking at the design space
the difference was with the shuttle we were using an r value of one point six one point seven
and so we were able to get down to a forty minute pre breathe
what we do with the shuttle is about the day before you are going to do your first eva you actually drop the cabin pressure
and when we had the lecture on environmental control remember there is a cabin pressure controller at fourteen point seven and a pressure controller at eight psi
but when they designed the shuttle nobody was thinking about eva or about this pre breathe time
and so there is no ten point two controller
we have to do that manually
you drop it and then you add a little bit of nitrogen or a little bit of oxygen depending on what the instrumentation tells you you need
and then there is a periodic maintenance which you have to perform in order to keep the proper gas concentrations
and then we leave it down there for the duration of all the evas
and then when the last eva is finished then you turn the fourteen point seven controller back on
now of course since you have the proper oxygen partial pressure most of the gas that comes into the cabin is nitrogen
and actually i think we may have mentioned this before it comes in the bathroom
and so for the time when you are re pressurizing the cabin the bathroom is off limits
and i think that is basically it
the timing has been pretty good
questions
comments
yeah
is anybody looking at using a fully one atmospheric spacesuit
actually it turns out there is a principle called holdings principle
let me get this up because i have some pictures of what we were doing
if you change by less than a factor of two you don't get the bends
this is an empirical finding
and so the idea was if you could have a suit that worked at about eight psi you would have a zero pre breathe suit
and i participated in a bunch of tests
these are some other robotic things
this was the hard suit designed by ames
because it is a constant volume suit it is not sensitive to the pressure the way that a soft suit is
and we did a lot of tests actually
we always came unstuck on the gloves
nobody has been able to design an eight psi glove that really gives you sufficient mobility
i mean it is a dream
people would love to be able to do it
if we could figure it out that would solve all these problems
although if you are going to mars maybe you don't want full pressure because if you have one atmosphere compared to eight or nine psi your structure has to be that much thicker and heavier
they went through some of those calculations
this is now on the hand with the space station
and they figured that for all the meteorite shielding and everything they had to put on the outside of the space station that actually the change in thickness that would be involved in changing the pressure from one atmosphere to another really wouldn't make that much of a difference
all of these things again they are interrelated
but it is a good point
that is why i showed those designs for six psi because people are still thinking suppose we could design a spacesuit to work at a higher pressure
but right now we don't know how to do that
i hope everybody has a very happy thanksgiving
we will see you a week from today
and if there are any questions again about either your oral presentations or the written presentations i will be here today
and then i am gone for the rest of the week but i will be looking at emails so you can send me emails and we can discuss things
ok
today we have an old colleague and friend of mine
tony lavoie actually got his engineering degree in the aero astro department here at mit so this is coming back home for him
and he actually grew up in massachusetts
but for the last twenty three years he has been in huntsville alabama at the marshall space flight center and actually has been an engineer on quite a few of the projects that i have flown with including the astro observatory and the tethered satellite
and tony has continued to rise up in the ranks of the nasa engineering community
he is now i guess the project manager for the robotic lunar exploration program
if you have been following the space news marshall space flight center is going to be developing the first robotic lunar lander that we have ever sent to the moon since surveyor
it will be like forty years i guess we haven't done that
and we are going to have to figure out how to do it
tony was also the chief engineer on the chandra x ray observatory which was launched on the shuttle
and so i thought it would be interesting to hear since we've been looking at many other aspects of space shuttle operations to hear something about what it was like getting a payload ready to fly on the shuttle
but also we were discussing before class began that he may have some comments on the robotic lunar exploration program which is now in the pre phase a studies
and it will sort of be interesting
we talked a lot about what it was like in the pre phase a and the early days of coming up with the requirements for the shuttle
and clearly in the systems engineering getting the requirements right is one of the key goals for success
tony may have some comments on that
i have talked enough
tony you've got it
hi there
we are going to start talking about chandra
and as jeff pointed out i am also going to talk about my new challenge my new assignment as project manager and in pre phase a what that means
and i think it is a lot different being a student where you have a single closed form solution and you go and you work a problem and it is done
in the real world you seldom if ever work a problem one time and have it finish
and we will get into that as we go along
i am going to talk about chandra x ray observatory
and these are just a few images that chandra has produced
it is an outstanding x ray imager and it has been flying since july of ninety nine
and you are going to get all the gory details and all the lessons learned that we had in working that project
i will do an overview chandra history and then the challenges we faced and lessons learned associated with that and we will cover those topics
in terms of how we operate feel free to ask questions as we go along
it is kind of lose and easy
chandra or back then it was axaf advanced x ray astrophysics facility
nasa by the way loves acronyms
i mean if you are interested in working with nasa or associated with nasa they are just acronym crazy
axaf was one of the four great observatories
the four great observatories were meant to cover as close to the entire spectrum as nasa could
and so the visible great observatory is hubble
and ultraviolet that's true little ultraviolet
the x ray observatory is axaf which was later named chandra
the gamma ray observatory is the compton gamma ray observatory
and the last one was infrared
and that originally started off as sirtf
and now it is spitzer
and that was launched a few years ago
in each of the four great observatories they were higher class than most of the other science missions even the science telescopes
and nasa did invest quite a bit of money on each of those
and so you will see that the performance from the four great observatories are in terms of quality probably the best in the world and the best nasa has ever done
for the x ray region chandra or axaf was built
and its objective you start with program objectives and you work down with science objectives
the science objectives were really to understand the nature of the universe and determine the nature of celestial objects in particular those that are hot
and hot objects will produce x rays
and of course jeff knows all about that
if you have any questions related to that you can ask jeff
but from an engineer perspective what happens is you are given a set of objects and maybe a program objective and now you have to craft the mission and craft the project from those
and one of the problems that you face is that sometimes they are not crisp and sometimes they are flexible based on cost
and also sometimes they are not very specific
like determine the nature of celestial objects from stars to quasars
now what
but this is the kind of thing that typically you start with
and you have to iterate with in this case the science community
if you are building part of the shuttle you have to iterate with for instance the users the astronauts the payload developers that would use the shuttle the operators et cetera
but the process is the same
you start with the top level objectives and you work your way down
now again because of the nature of what we are talking about it is usually a very iterative process that can last for several months
and even several years if there is a technical challenge that causes you to stretch out
and i will mention when it started
in terms of axaf kind of the key parameters are the percent in circled energy i_e how sharp is the image
registration meaning where is the target in the sky
and you have got to remember that x ray astronomy is a relatively new branch of astronomy
because of the atmosphere it absorbs x rays
so we humans only discovered x ray astronomy in the last forty years
we need to go outside the atmosphere to get information on x ray astronomy
one of the things that we did know is if there are some x ray sources there they may or may not be the same sources that also emit invisible light
and if they are not then you have a question of you kind of know there is a source out there but you don't know where in the sky it is
and so one of the challenges that axaf had was even if i have no stars around this x ray source i have got to be able to pinpoint where that x ray source is
that was a particular challenge that we had trying to figure out how to do that
and that is what registration means
and then effective area is related to how many photons you can collect to make a good image
and recognize that if you are looking at the sun the sun is very close so you can get a lot of photons but if you are looking at something that is ten billion light years away you are not collecting very many photons so you have to wait a long time to get those photons unless you have a big collecting area
those are kind of the key performance requirements that you have to address when you are building an x ray telescope
from those there are key derived requirements that have to be derived basically to be able to maximize the scientific performance requirements
and so from these pieces of information you derive mirror size and design you derive focal length
pointing and control requirements how accurately do you need to point
thermal stability because that plays a role in orbit a very big role
instrument sensitivity and the fiducial transfer system which i will talk about later which is the thing that allows you to do the registration even the absence of local visible stars around it
once you have the bulk of the science performance requirements and the derived requirements from these performance requirements then you fill in kind of the rest of the pie if you will
and those can be safety requirements in the case of a manned program
in fact that is pretty significant
and it is a pretty significant cost driver for things that fly in space
unfortunately they also cost a lot to make sure they are not a hazard to the crew that flies
there are also design and construction standards which also turns out to be a big deal
for instance if you are building a satellite and you have circuit cards you are going to have requirements on soldering you are going to have requirements on integrated circuits you are going to have requirements on glazing you are going to have requirements on bonding
you are going to have requirements on how to do things across the whole gamut of the spacecraft
not just the spacecraft but also the shuttle and anything that flies up there
for a given mission there are probably on the order of one hundred point one hundred fifty separate documents that describe various things design and construction standards that you have to go through for a particular piece of building the vehicle
and so those things are always a challenge for a project manager because the engineers want to get the latest standard that applies and in excruciating detail as engineers love to do
and yet from the project manger's standpoint we are trying to maintain cost
there is always a tradeoff between how good is good enough
from a program manager's perspective better is the enemy of good
yet from an engineer good is always better or better is always better
there is always a healthy tension between the project manager and the engineers
and i would say that a successful project knows how to tradeoff
the project manager and the engineers know how to balance that tension to be able to get the best product
and we have done that before and we have also imbalanced it and had some spectacular failures
once requirements are set then you can start kind of designing and starting to put the drawings on developing the system if you will
but that is kind of the general flow of information for a science payload or a science mission
you start with the top level requirements for performance the scientific performance that you are looking for
from those you derive the direct performance requirements like what you see here and then everything else cascades below that
and once you have the requirements set then you can start developing concepts
now this was a preliminary design of axaf
i am not going to talk about it but i am just going to show the next slide as to what it looks like now
and so you can see that there is a major difference between what it started out as and what it ended up as
and this is typical
it is not atypical
and the reason is cost
a lot of times when you are first starting out with requirements you kind of don't know what the cost of the mission is going to be
and so you come up with an idea that has a lot of capability
this was orbit serviceable it was in low earth orbit and it had four focal plane instruments that you could select
and it would actually move much like hubble
and it was a fifteen year mission with reservicing with the shuttle astronauts
but when you start putting that on paper and you start crafting the requirements one of the things you do in the early phase of a program is you also cost or you try and cost what those requirements result in in terms of design
even though you don't do the final design or you don't start working on the design in detail until after you've got the requirements set in practical terms you have to still put together a concept design so that you can cost it
and that is exactly what happened on axaf
we put together a design in parallel with working the requirements and we costed the design
and it turned out that that was more money than nasa could afford
and so as is typical the iteration process begins with headquarters to change the parameters of the mission
to in a sense compromise the scientific objectives a little bit in terms of implementing a requirement set
and the result is finally you get something that you can pay for and that still meets the intent of the scientific objectives
that is a key lesson to learn
when you are first starting out when you are first crafting what you want to do except it to change
and the key there is it is usually cost driven as to what you can afford
not only that nasa just by the nature of what it is doing since it has never built an axaf before it is really hard to get a good accurate cost of what it costs
so a lot of times the cost is derived from a parametric usually weight based system such that for instance if the mirrors or if the solar rays you want them this big to provide this much power
that big means they have to weigh or they mass so many kilograms
and so that is about x amount of dollars based on weight
now there are a lot of additional factors that you put in like complexity interfaces
et cetera technology readiness whether you are looking for state of the art or something that has already flown
but generally it is what is called a parametric cost model
and it is not based on taking a look at all the design drawings and saying this cost this much from the vendor this cost this much and you put it all together
that is called a bottoms up assessment
and it is more accurate but it also relies on having an accurate design picture which obviously you don't have early on in a program
i mean it is almost like a black art to try and take a requirement set and craft a design early on or at least bound the design and bound the cost
because again early on what you are trying to do is get into the cost envelope and still meet the scientific objectives or the objectives that you are trying to do
yes
in this final design how are its capabilities versus the original
i mean because you didn't put as much money into it
correct
to make it on orbit replaceable means that all of the boxes that you see in the spacecraft bus or a lot of them would have had to have been on this picture replaceable
they were all replaceable
you have to spend some money making sure that the drawers slide in slide out there are no sharp edges and it is accessible et cetera
so packaging is important
that is one area where you can reduce cost and not really have an effect on performance per se
however one of the big areas that we did take a little bit of a hit on performances is on the mirrors
now x rays you cannot just have a regular shaped lens
what we use is grazing incidence mirrors
and i will explain this later
because the x rays are so highly energetic you have to graze them gradually to a focus
and the original concept had six mirrors nested
they were basically hyperbola parabola shaped
the final concept had four
we had to remove not the inside or the outside but two of the middle mirrors
so the mirror set is four
this orbit that this flies in is a highly elliptical orbit
it is about one hundred forty thousand kilometers by ten thousand kilometers
the original orbit was in low earth orbit which is about three hundred fifty kilometers
and so that affects the viewing time
but in all of the other registration and encircled energy i think that we still were able to meet the original objectives of the scientific mission
there are ways to compromise that don't really affect directly what the scientists want to do but it is a tradeoff
it is usually not their first desire but they signed up to it they are comfortable with the final answer
explaining a little bit of how it is put together
this is a rather simplified version
here are the solar rays
that is where we get our power
this is the spacecraft bus
this is the hrma which is the mirrors the nested cylinders that i was talking about earlier
this is a low energy grading and a high energy grading
for spectroscopy what you want to do is you want to bend all of the photons in a particular energy much like a prism does for visible light
and the way you do that is with these facets
there are probably a thousand facets on this
and i have a picture of that later
and you flip it into the beam when you want to get some spectroscopy data
and you remove the grading when you want to get an x ray image of what you are looking at
and that is a function of what the scientists want to do at a particular target
some scientists want to get an image because that conveys more information for them than spectroscopy
others want to see a spectrogram of the image because that tells them what the photons are and what the energy of the photons are
and that can tell you for instance what elements are present and what temperatures for a given gas cloud or neutron star or what have you
and then we have an optical bench
and all that means is it is a piece of structure that is very stiff
because obviously you can tell if you flex a lot that sure doesn't help your camera imaging the performance
it has got to be very stiff and that is why they call it an optical bench
and the ism is the integrated science module
that is where the instruments sit in chandra
and here is a picture as i mentioned before of how the x rays graze off of the cylinders in the hrma down to a focal point about ten meters away
jeff had mentioned that sometimes it takes quite a while for science to come to fruition in a mission
and this is probably a good case
it started in one thousand nine hundred seventy eight with some concepts
we did get approval for new start in one thousand nine hundred eighty eight so you can tell there was ten years time where this was just an idea in a scientist's mind
and typically the course of events is that the scientist lobbies and submits papers
submits proposals to nasa lobbies congress lobbies the national science foundation to say this is a good idea we should do this and here is the concept
and of course that concept changes over time as you get new technology et cetera
and so that is exactly what happened here
we did get approval ten years from when the original concept started
authority to proceed for the prime contract was in january one thousand nine hundred eighty nine
what this means is that is when we hired a contractor to build the spacecraft
and the start of that process is called atp
we had two separate atps
sometimes you can say i can let out one contract to a company and let that company buy the science instruments or i can compete the science instruments separately
and there are various pros and cons but in this case nasa decided to compete the instruments separately
from an engineer's point of view one of the things that should peak your interest or note that when you have separate contracts you always have a question of integration
if you are going to compete separately you are going to have two separate pieces
who is going to integrate them
the integration job will be harder when you compete them separately
now your performance is probably better when you have direct insight into the instruments and direct insight into the spacecraft contractor
but the penalty is now when you integrate the two you have to make sure that works
and so as a project manager as a systems engineer you have to make sure you apply enough resources to make sure they work together and continue to work together as they are defining the interfaces for instance between the two elements
this was interesting in that in order to get it funded congress said we will let you build an axaf but along the way you have to do some testing to show that you can meet the performance that you say you can meet
and so we were required by law to have a test of the mirrors in june of ninety one
and we also had another test later on the same thing to verify that we could get the performance that we showed on paper with actual hardware before we committed to fly and before nasa committed to spend the rest of the money to fly
and so sometimes that happens sometimes if you have a smaller program it doesn't go to congress so you don't get into those things
but when you have a great observatory and nasa is spending a lot of money a lot of times congress will get in and say yes you're constrained but you have to show me along the way that you can do this
i wouldn't be surprised if congress does that for the cev the new vehicle coming up or the clv
in fact for the clv the launch vehicle there is a push to have a demonstration test early just to verify that we can do it
now during this time of course we are still formulating requirements
and we rack up the cost
and low and behold nasa cannot afford it
we went through a program restructure at that time where we dropped a couple of the mirrors we changed its orbit we removed crew servicing
and you could tell that the whole shape of the spacecraft changed
again that is unfortunately not atypical
it happens quite often
yes
what was the reason for the orbit change
good question
in orbit there are van allen radiation belts
and we really cannot observe too well within those belts
now in the first mission the low earth orbit mission we were below the belts so we could operate
but the problem with low earth orbit is you have this big earth you are close to earth and so you need power from the sun
and guess what the sun goes behind the earth
and so you are eclipsed for a good percentage of the orbit time
when we had a fifteen year mission in low earth orbit we said since we don't have servicing the lifetime cuts down to five years
now if i am five years in low earth orbit i have just lost two thirds of my mission time
so let's see if we can crank up the orbit get as far outside the radiation belts as we can
and then we have basically one hundred percents visibility the whole orbit if we can get completely outside
the problem with that is that costs propellant because the radiation belts end they breathe but roughly around sixty thousand kilometers
we could raise apogee to one hundred forty point zero but we didn't have enough money to raise perigee
it gets down to money again
so perigee stayed at about ten thousand kilometers
the resulting orbit time if you looked at the integral of time outside the radiation belts was probably about seventy percents
it was a compromise
we did end up losing some overall time but about seventy percents of the orbit is usable for viewing
that is the strategy and that is why we went to a different orbit
as you can tell there are a lot of things that are traded off during that time to fit within the constraints that you have got
again that is typical
the three reviews that are kind of standard reviews for all programs and projects are you start with a requirements review
and that is pretty basic
it is held early on
requirements have started before that review
for science missions you start with science objectives
and you are percolating science requirements
and the system requirements review is really a review that baselines if you will and sets the requirements as firm as you can
and it is usually after you have gone through the cost gyrations but it is done prior to doing any of the design reviews
once you have a requirements review done it was in december of ninety two almost two years later we had what is called a preliminary design review in november of ninety four
the third review is called a critical design review in february of ninety six
what makes a preliminary design review and critical design review has to do with the maturity level of the design
for critical design review supposedly you have on the order of ninety percents of your drawings complete and on the order of ten percents of your hardware built
and i think for pdr it is about ten percents of your drawings built the final drawings
that kind of gages what you are talking about there
and it is a typical milestone that nasa uses for all of its programs
usually these are set early on in the mission in the program milestones
and for political and for programmatic reasons you tend not to deviate
you try and meet those milestones
even if the project is not as mature as you would like usually that is one that you try and keep hold of
maybe you don't have ten percents maybe you have five percents or maybe you don't have ninety percents you have seventy percents
sometimes you do go and you hold the milestone you hold the review but when you are not mature enough sometimes you have to hold a delta review to catch up
and that is again something that nasa does for various reasons
if the situation is right sometimes you can slip and allow a single review at the right time
most often it is driven by nontechnical things that require you either by your customer headquarters they don't want you to slip so you tend to hold it where he said he wanted it
and then we had the mirror delivery to the calibration facility in november
it shipped the whole thing to the cape for launch in february and we launched in july
you can see we spent about five or six months down at the cape integrating into the shuttle testing and then we flew in july of ninety nine
those are the orbit parameters
we achieved the final orbit august seven th so you can see about two weeks
and the way we did that is the shuttle only puts stuff to low earth orbit so you need some additional propulsion
we had an upper stage that got us part of the way there used most of the energy
however it wasn't at the final orbit
so integral to the spacecraft we had a propulsion system that had to do five additional burns to get us to the final altitude and the final orbit parameters
that is why it took us about two weeks
and again that is not atypical
when you are not operating in low earth orbit it takes you while to get your final orbit
and these are a couple of interesting parameters
safe mode we will talk a little bit about that
spacecraft are designed such that if yeah
i am just wondering if the inclination affects the requirements at all or does it not really matter so it just stays
the twenty eight point five is driven largely by the launch site at kennedy space center
right
i am just wondering if the science requirements could drive the inclination
for some missions yes
we were fairly incentive to that as long as we took advantage of launching at ksc at the optimum inclination
but there are missions like space station
because you have a launch from ksc and a launch from russia to optimize the performance of both launch centers then the orbit is fifty eight point five
now what that means to ksc launch is that you pay a significant penalty
you pay about a thirty percents weight penalty for launch at ksc to the space station
sometimes the answer is yes you can optimize inclination and sometimes when you have a large program and multiple launch sites it is a compromise
so it is not efficient for each site
i was mentioning spacecraft typically have their avionics systems
and typically they do not contract the ground
they are not in communication with the ground all the time
and so for chandra that is the case
we may have contact with chandra probably about five percents to ten percents of the time per day
in the meantime figure that ninety percents of the time it is out of communication range
now this is something by the way that is somewhat different from a manned mission
the manned missions tend to optimize and maximize communication coverage
when jeff is flying in the shuttle we probably have ninety percents ninety five percents coverage over an orbit and over a day for communication
but in science missions rarely is that the case
and so what that means is the whole philosophy of operating a science mission is based on stored commands
and so we send up a stored command load
and that load is good for a day
and basically it steps through and automatically executes based on time
what that also means is you have to design a spacecraft to recognize when it has a problem
if a hardware box has a failure it has got to be able to recognize that and go into a safe mode so that the ground can then recover and configure the systems to continue to operate
that is one part of flying a spacecraft is building a robust safe mode to be able to do that
and our first problem occurred august seventeen point one thousand nine hundred ninety nine
now note it was a ground error
as usually the case spacecraft are pretty complicated
and we probably had four hundred or five hundred separate procedures and commands on the ground for doing certain things
and even though we try and test them out individually the combination of those procedures and in the execution sometimes you put the spacecraft in the wrong configuration with one sequence and then you follow with another sequence
low and behold the software that you designed for safe mode says i am in the wrong configuration
sorry i am going to safe mode
and so that happens
we have had only probably three safe mode events for six years so that is not too bad at all
hubble for instance has had probably an order of magnitude more than that
i think we have gotten smarter based on our design of hubble to design this
but again typically spacecraft do have safe mode designs in them
given our orbit we still have a small eclipse season
twice a year in the fall and in the spring we have eclipses
and so our first eclipse season was then
this is the translation mechanics for the science instruments
this is where the telescope is
i won't go through that
this is kind of where we purchases or we contracted for the various instruments
this is a ccd imaging spectrometer
in fact it was both penn state and mit that produced this one
and that is one of the focal plate instruments and the other one was a high resolution camera using micro channel plate technology instead of a ccd
and that one was from sao just down the street in cambridge
the high energy transmission grating as i had mentioned was also from mit
and the low energy grating was from the netherlands
and this is a good point to make also is that a lot of times for science instruments or for science missions nasa tries to lower the cost of the mission
and the way you can do that is you can reduce requirements or you can get a partner and have the partner pay for an instrument that you want to fly
and so in this case as is typically the case for science missions nasa tries to go and get international partners that will bring to the table an element or a piece of hardware or some software that reduces the overall cost of the mission but at the same time maintains its capability
that is what we did with the low energy transmission grating
we got the netherlands to basically design and build that and fly that in exchange for that kind of arrangement
they get a percentage of viewing time that they can say for five percents of the viewing time we get to point the telescope to wherever we want
and so typically that is kind of the handoff between our international partners and nasa in trying to reduce the overall cost to nasa for a given mission
and these are the gratings as i had mentioned
and there are a bunch of facets along these
now notice these are the four mirror shells where they co align with the four mirror shells the inner most and the outer most
and this is kind of how it works
the gratings get flipped in
and this is the array of ccds
each one of these is a ccd
and the pattern of light or the pattern of x rays follows along these lines when the x rays actually come in
that is what actually you see
now chandra does have a ground system architecture
we communicate with the deep space network
that is how we communicate because it is not in low earth orbit so we cannot use the satellites that are around the earth
we get that signal from that satellite and it is beamed to the control center here in cambridge in fact
and we do various things on the data
we process it out and send it to the general observers
now the way this operates is that every year this control center or the science folks operating the control center solicit objectives
ok science community come and request time and give me a proposal for viewing time for what you want to do what target you want to look at what is the configuration of the instrument which instrument et cetera
and so the chandra folks go through and they probably collect about eight hundred proposals a year from all around the world
they will select roughly about two hundred
and it is not based on numbers it is based on time
you have a certain amount of seconds in a year that is available
and so some of these proposals have large times some have small times but roughly it is about a four to one
about two hundred are selected eight hundred are proposed so that's good you're oversubscribed you have a lot of interest
nasa does fund those that are selected
so if you are a pi and you say i want to go look at crab nebula or i want to go look at a quasar somewhere and here are the reasons here is what that will tell me
and it gets selected
nasa will fund you some money to be able to do that observation and process the data and publish
now nasa won't fund any that were selected from foreign countries
so the foreign countries they have to get their funding but we will allow them viewing time
and that is also typically the case
and by the way all of these scientists across the world never have to come to cambridge
it is all done electronically
they don't get their data real time
they get it probably a few weeks after the observation
and the reason for that is there is a lot of processing
you don't actually send or you can but usually you don't send the raw data out to the user
it is heavily processed and the products of that processing are what is actually sent out
now there are tools that the control center also provides but generally it is the process data that is sent
yes
what sort of data is this
images or numerical data
it is data that can be used for images
it can be used for registering each photon what energy it is
there are a lot of different choices of data
and some of the data is overlapping but it does give you information on energy location number count where in the field
it can be used to then process an image or process a spectrogram
and you do that by using the tools that are also provided
it is like a viewer or it is like a piece of software that allows you to view what is in that data
but the data is just the raw data
it is just a series of tables
and as we said it began in one thousand nine hundred seventy eight
i picked the prime and was given a new start
i am not going to go through these
it was restructured
we went to four mirror pairs
we dropped two focal plane instruments dropped the servicing requirements
i mentioned that
interestingly enough one of the instruments we wanted to create a separate spacecraft just for that instrument
and believe it or not the addition of this spacecraft and this one for the spectroscopy mission was going to be cheaper than the original concept
but again due to cost we continued this spectroscopy spacecraft for about a year to two years
and then that was cut due to cost
so we ended up flying just this one spacecraft
and the result is the chandra observatory that we have now
note that sometimes it is not within your control as to whether your program is cancelled or not
we were doing quite well
it was within our cost envelope that they had given us
but at the time there were other priorities at nasa and there were other overruns at nasa
and they have to weigh
sometimes they say well you can have this much money for these many years
and every year they re evaluate
and that is because you don't know how much things are going to cost because nasa typically builds one of a kind things and you don't know really how much it costs until it is already done
so that re evaluation process continues now
and it will probably continue for as long as nasa flies
so imaging and spectroscopy is what we do
why is imaging so important
well clearly this image was a rosat image with the highest technology at the time
and here is the chandra image
and you can see the neutron star right there
and there is no way you can see a neutron star in there
and they can learn a lot more from this image than they can from this so that is why scientists push to get good imaging resolution as well as good spectroscopy
the biggest challenge for us on chandra was the mirrors
now recognize that due to the analysis that we performed early on yes this was all theoretically possible but we had to be able to polish the surfaces of those mirrors those grazing incidence mirrors to an accuracy of on the order of angstroms
and that is pretty small
can we measure that
the answer is no
at the time we couldn't even measure how accurately we needed to polish the mirrors
so that tells you that boy we've got our work cut out
we had to work with the national institute for standards to figure out how to first measure how accurately we can polish it and then ended up polishing the mirrors
and polishing as a process getting down to that smoothness clearly is a huge challenge and takes a long time
and so that was probably our biggest challenge is to polish the mirrors
metrology is the science of working mirror technology and getting the surface figure of the mirrors correct
so really the key to success is developing three different types of metrology measurements that are independent that allow you to cross check
because you are talking about things you have never built before and you are pushing the state of the art and you don't know how to measure it
the key there for an engineer should say ok i need not just one way of checking my work but i need at least two ways and preferably three independent ways of making sure that i am doing the right thing
so when you're pushing the state of the art a good lesson is try and get into a position where you have got more than one independent check of your analysis to make sure it is correct
so that was a very big challenge for us
and again that is kind of how it goes down
this is the general shape of the mirrors
and here are the mirror pairs being assembled
and of course one thing about the mirrors is when you are talking about that surface finish you cannot just assemble it in your garage with dust around
you have to be extremely clean
and believe it or not one of the dirtiest things in a laboratory is a human
and so a human has to be almost completely covered to prevent any kind of accumulation on the mirrors themselves
in fact we had to limit the exposure time of humans to the unpolished and polished mirrors during this timeframe because contamination is an incredible problem when you are talking about the atomic scales of polishing the mirrors
again i mention that the important thing is to make sure that you are doing cross checks in the metrology as you are going along
because again you don't know exactly what you are doing
i mean on paper yes you've got an analytical solution that tells you the right answer but you have never done it before
you have never built it before
you don't know how to measure it
so you have got to work on building confidence that your analysis is correct
how do i know that analysis is correct
and so you have got to think about a sanity check if you will to make sure that those are correct
and of course the best way for proving that it is correct is test them
and that is what we did
mandated by congress we tested the mirrors
now the thing about that is so i test the mirrors
i am testing the mirrors in a one g environment so even after the test how do i know that those results are correct
because the one g deflection even though you think it is small it does affect the mirror performance on the ground versus in orbit
and another thing is the finite source distance
you cannot get a source that is infinitely far away on the ground just because of the nature of putting a source out there
our source was about i think a quarter mile away
and we had to make analytical corrections to compensate for how we expected the spot size to change because of that finite source distance
we had to analytically correct the image on the ground to compensate for the one g affects of the mirrors
and so even a test you would think ok go test it
well it is not straightforward because even in that test that is not a true representation of how it would work on orbit
so it is a lot more complicated than one would think
what do you use your x rays for
various things
we had some monochromatic x rays at various wavelengths
we had registration x rays
iron
a certain wavelength of iron is a big one to use
you don't have a picture of the big tunnel do you
i think i do in here
i have got a picture of it and i can talk about
but that is another thing is when you are testing how well do i know my source
and that is all factored into verifying that you have got the performance correct because if your source is all over the place and you haven't characterized your source well enough then how in the world can you say that the mirrors are that good
so we did end to end testing
and again you don't just look at the raw data and say yeah i am there
even in the ground test a lot of times you have to massage the data and compensate analytically for factors that you cannot control
and the key to success there is good systems engineering
and a lot of that is because of multiple separate parties academia nonprofits and foreign groups all involved in the workings of axaf
you have got to make sure that you have got a team that works together
lesson learned as i had mentioned perform multiple cross checks either via test or analysis with a different tool as possible
another lesson learned is let more than one group perform the review
a lot of times for chandra we had the marshall engineers but we also contracted sao down the street to kind of independently assess using their own software tools where we were
and that was a good idea because sometimes we had good ideas that we could incorporate and sometimes they had good ideas but it gave us a sanity check when we both matches and we both felt good
there is also no substitute for direct test or measurement
analytically we have wonderful tools nowadays but they will never take the place of testing
another thing that was very important for us because of the iteration cycle with headquarters on funding is make sure that you keep the science or the scientists that are part of the mission informed and part of the decision making process
one would think and one would like to think that this is a technical project all things are technical
no there are personalities involved and there are human responses involved
and so to keep the team together you need make sure that the science is informed and supporting your decision making process
a lot of times that is overlooked but it is nonetheless very important as you are building a project
and the final lesson learned is as we are going through and making those mirrors you construct what is called an error budget
you assume perfect performance and then you kind of step back and say i am going to allow imperfect performance in this region
and i am going to allocate that imperfect performance to thermal design
i am going to allocate imperfect performance to the inaccurate knowledge of knowing the source positions in the sky
i am going to allocate some error budget to flexing of the optical bench
i am going to allocate some error sources to the difference between how long the focal length is and how long i think it is
and so you take each of the error terms
and for chandra we probably had a hundred or more
and you go through and you verify that your assumption in that error budget term was correct
and usually for the critical ones you did it in more than one way more than one method so that you were sure that you had those error terms defined
and the end result was we had mirrors that performed better than expected
and as a result the payoff is just wonderful
this is a time lapse series of images
and supposedly this wave front was moving out from the source pulsar at significant fractions of the speed of light on the order of twenty percents to thirty percents of the speed of light
that was pretty cool
and if you need more information just talk to jeff
but that was a pretty big payoff
the next challenge that we had was the programmatic challenge
again as i had mentioned the normal process of going through a program in a project is you are first trying to size the mission
and really you are sizing it for cost
and that is very hard to do when you are building something new
and that was a very big challenge
and so we changed a lot of things
but eventually the key or the critical thing that you are trying to do is i compromise on this but i want to still try and maintain performance
we maintained our imaging resolution performance and our registration performance
and we compromised on a few other things but we maintained that performance
finish this slide and then we will take a quick break
note down here that we also needed to reduce the weight by a factor of two from our original designs
our original designs were pretty simple aluminum structures
our final designs were the best composites that we knew how to make at lowest weight
and so that optical bench that tube was all composite
and so that is the kind of weight reduction scheme we had to go through
now also all of the fittings that means all of the brackets that we use were also composite
and another challenge that we had is analyzing the stresses in a complicated composite fitting
very hard to do
didn't have techniques to do it when we started
as part of the process of building this telescope we had to go through and learn that and develop those techniques
before the break i just want to point out i hope you all are catching the incredible parallels between this project a complex technological process and the sorts of things that we've heard about the systems engineering of the shuttle
right from the weight problems and composites new materials new ways of analysis right into the intervention of congress into the engineering process i mean it is all there
and i think whenever you get involved in a big space project you can expect that those things are going to happen and they are probably going to happen in the exploration program as well
two minute break and then we will start up again
start up again
let's see
we were talking about for us the next biggest challenge was programmatic in that it you have to work that early on
and typically especially the more expensive missions do go through this as a typical part of the lifecycle of a project
i have a question on that last slide
the budget for systems engineering was cut which translates directly to the number of folks at the contractor site
working systems engineering was cut so we were challenged
and what we did at marshall was we offset with nasa's civil servants doing functions and tasks that the contractor would normally do to compensate for that
so that is what that meant
typically systems engineering a very important thing if you talk to folks in the trade almost everyone has a different idea of what all is encompassed in systems engineering
but the point is there probably are a number of things that almost everybody would agree are part of systems engineering
and they are very key to executing the program and the project
they are really the glue that holds all the subsystems together
and i will probably talk more about it but for good systems engineers you have to be able to communicate well with all the other subsystems and all the other stakeholders including the science when you have a science mission including the users when you have a manned mission including safety and everybody to make sure they are all connected
and be smart enough to be able to challenge the subsystems when they really have their own ideas on where this needs to go and it is not really in concert with everybody else
weight reduction did have some impacts as i mentioned using light weight composites
and that was a challenge in and of itself
we also dropped two of the sis
another challenge was the science instrument module which was all composite
and it had the capability of adjusting focus and translating so it had two degrees of freedom
but it needed to be reproducible in terms of motion on the micron scale over the whole orbit environment
that was quite a challenge in and of itself to be able to do that
i mean just kind of a flavor for the things that you have to deal with is not everybody had the same analysis tools so universities like mit and like sao had different structural analysis tools for their hardware than the contractors did
now you do a couple loads analysis which is you pull together all of your stress all of your structure analysis models together in one place and you go through a loads assessment all through the whole element
well to do that i need a model from you i need a model from you i need a model from you
but you are in california you are a university you are another company and you have to make sure they all play together
and a lot of times there is parochialness with company a i am not going to use anything but my model
and the university says well i cannot do anything but what we have been doing
and university c says well this is the only thing that will work and you guys are crazy
it is not that bad but that is the kind of thing that you have to deal with as a systems engineer
you have to make sure everybody plays together
and sometimes you have to go through and work the best solution that may not be the optimum solution for each piece
but it is the optimum solution for the overall answer
again getting the programmatic challenge behind us a key thing is also setting allocations
i talk about the error budgets
another good thing that the systems engineer does is allocates various important resources
and one that every spacecraft does is weight
weight power and data are usually three of the important resources that are allocated
for scientific telescope missions another one is error budgets for scientific performance
but the key to that is good weight allocation and good iteration which with each of the elements that you allocated the weight to to keep up with them to make sure they can meet that or it looks like they are going to exceed
so i have got to go borrow some of that allocation from somebody else
and i have got to take away from peter if you will to pay paul
so systems engineering and going through that making the initial allocations and keeping up with that is a pretty critical factor to making sure you get to the final answer
and if you do that well then usually you have less of a problem getting to the final solution
to compensate for the loss of systems engineering we established technical oversight panels which were nasa employees at our center
we controlled at a project level the internal icds
now what is an icd
it is an interface control drawing
because when you have company a developing an element and university a where they come together is an interface
and you have to document that interface not just mechanically but thermally
what is the heat flow across the interface the data across the interface the power the signal characteristics across the interface
the data flow
what data is going across the interface
and as you can realize as both of those things change you have to change the interface
so you have to keep up with that
and a lot of times good systems engineers will recognize the further away in location it is the harder it is to interface with the two parties
when you are in california it is one thing when they are in the same town it is another thing when they are in the same country and it is another thing where they are across the water when you are integrating an international partner
so as systems engineers the factor is the closer you are the better it is because i can just go in a car and go across town to get out the drawings and talk about the drawings versus in california that is a plane ride
but in europe the time difference allows you to only be able to talk to them for a few hours a day because that is when your work shifts overlap
so it is a lot more complicated interacting with folks in europe interacting with folks in japan in india because of the time difference and because it is very far away when you have to sit down
those are kind of the challenges as systems engineers that you should think about
lessons learned
set your resource allocations early and continue to monitor them and work with each of the owners of the elements of those allocations to make sure that they are meeting their allocation
as you recognize it is a zero sum gain
so when somebody goes over their allocation somebody has got to be reduced
and it is very difficult sometimes to negotiate that reduction because engineers typically want to hold their margin they don't want to release it
they want it because they are not yet confident in their final solution
but to make everything play sometimes you have to take away from them and reduce their margin to be able to let somebody else survive if you will
it is not an easy thing but attention to that detail is important
maintaining strong systems engineering group is important for that reason
if i have a lot of pretty dominant subsystem managers that say i am building a power system and i need this much weight and i need this much thermal capability that's good and they may be very good but what they are doing is if you have a lot of dominant subsystems and no central systems engineering as traffic cop there is no check and balance
and so that dominant thing may work very well at the expense of the integrated performance of everybody else
that is why systems engineering is so important that dominance and to balance weakness where you have weakness
and for chandra hard work pays off when you get it right
technology
a lot of times nasa will build a science spacecraft
and the spacecraft itself usually isn't pushing a state of the art
for chandra it was a little different
we pushed the mirrors and there are a few other things we pushed
but typically it is the case where nasa pushes the state of the art on the instruments
better sensors better ccds better processing electronics
and chandra was no different
usually it is an embellishment from something that has flown before on a different spacecraft only now it is better
we are getting it bigger
we are getting more resolution
it takes less power
there is usually a steppingstone
and for asis the one that was built at mit it charged a couple of devices in an array size that they have never been built before
and so that was a challenge
also a challenge was in order for the ccds to operate they needed to be cooled to minus one hundred degrees celsius one hundred twenty
and in addition they developed a new way of clocking out the data from the rest of the ccds that have been built
that had better spectroscopy performance and a very low noise signal chain
there are always going and they are always looking at well on spacecraft x this ccd was flown
it may have been a five hundred twelve point five hundred twelve
well you know it is pretty easy
i can stretch it a little bit and work the substrate in twenty four point twenty four
well usually it is the case where it is not as simple as you think
and there are always problems
in particular technology should be a warning flag to systems engineers to say typically it is not as simple as you think so make sure you are paying attention to these new developments or these stretching of new applications of existing technology
because for instance one of the things that you get bit by and we got bit by is radiation susceptibility
thermal extremes for multilayer circuit cards that have to operate at minus one hundred twenty c on one end and room temperature on another end
low yields for those new types of ccds
i can just stretch it and make it one thousand twenty four point one thousand twenty four but where i was using ninety percents of the batch now i am only using ten percents just because i cannot get one that big to work out and to be smooth and homogenous
esd sensitivity
because they are getting bigger and bigger and thinner and thinner it is much more susceptible to electrostatic discharge
and simple things like my yield in the wintertime because the humidity in the air is lower
i have less of a yield in winter than i do in summer
and so that is what we found out
and there are also mitigating effects that you can come and put humidifiers in and compensate for that
but those are the types of things that you have to worry about that can come and bite you with new technology because you are doing something new
because of going down to one hundred twenty to optimize the performance and to get the very low noise we said we need a radiator or a sunshade
and low and behold flying on the shuttle in certain attitudes that you have to verify
because in some off nominal events you can instead of being deployed on day one of a mission you get deployed on day three but you have to go across the sun terminator frequently and you get a little glint of direct sunlight on these sunshades
and therefore you have to analyze what the temperature extreme and what the effect is going to be
and low and behold we see that we have delamination on that case
but here is a case where it is an off nominal event in the shuttle that we have to design for and we have to compensate for even though chances are we will never see that design case
but a lot of times the programmer or project manager has to say i am going to suck it up and i am going to make the change for that small eventuality
or i am going to risk it based on cost and we are going to try and preclude that eventuality from happening
a lot of times it is not cut and dry
it is a guessing game
it is a balance that is based on judgment past performance and a lot of other factors to say boy that is so low probability of occurrence that i am not going to worry about it
and that threshold is never defined
you have to define it as a project manager
just kind of a picture of what the instruments look like
there are the ccds
this is the long stretched away
and for the spectroscopy measurements that is where the lower energies actually the higher energies in the middle and the lower energies go along this wing and along this wing because you get the energy spread
and there are the imaging devices that are used when you just want a good image
on hrc there is the detector right there in this diamond shaped thing
and it is operating off a completely new and older technology than the ccds
the instrument of choice has been this for probably seventy percents seventy five percents of the observations just because of the capability that this allows you not just an image but the ccds also give you some rudimentary information on energy
and so that is why this is preferable over this one
on hrc we talked about asis
we had again a low noise signal chain
on hrc we never had three micro channel plates tied together and linked together
and we had that challenge
we also had very accurate event timing
so when we have a pulsar i know exactly in registered time when those pulses are occurring
we had spacecraft charging protection for new technology problems and spurious noise susceptibility
spacecraft charging
to keep the mirrors nice and warm at plus or minus half a degree c across the entire mirror surface all around it required thermal blankets on the outside
well the thermal blankets were susceptible to charging up and discharge with popping
and so the question is is that going to affect my instrument performance by incorrectly registering a photon event every time these blankets discharged
so we had to go through a test campaign to verify that no this discharging of those blanket electrostatically would not affect the imaging performance at the detector level
that is something we didn't even think about before
but low and behold we came up with it
yes these things are going to discharge they are going to pop so is it going to affect our measurements
those are the kinds of things that you will run into
again good systems engineering and sound communications are the key to getting through those
insuring participating
keeping parties informed
encouraging teamwork to be part of the team and to help contribute to its success
lesson learned is establish standing interface working groups with mandatory participation from the sis
the sis kind of have a different paradigm
science instruments are usually built by universities and the universities are typically staffed by grad students and some full time engineers
but usually the paradigm and the thinking process is a university atmosphere
when you have companies it is a completely different interface very regimented very by the book we have done it before and this is how you do it
and so different cultures you have to make sure they blend together to produce the final product
and a lot of times that is not technical
that is human interaction and making sure they all work together
when problems occur recognize that you need to go outside of the project office to get help
and this is typically done at nasa
if marshall is managing a project and we have got a problem with ccds the key to success is recognize well ames research center in california has an expert in ccds
call him up on the phone or bring him down and let's talk to him to get his expertise in on this project
nasa does good on that
it does go to where the expertise is
not just at another nasa center but it may call experts across the industry or across academia to come help with a problem
the foam problem on the shuttle is a pretty big problem and we have called experts from around the country and around the world to try and help understand what was going on with the foam
that is something that nasa does well is it brings in experts and it doesn't think that it knows everything locally
and that is something to keep in mind
if you don't know an answer don't just try and think of it yourself
go get the answers from somebody who might have experienced that before
and encourage teamwork
a lot of times programs suffer from the culture clash between different paradigms and different cultures
and that is especially the case between academia and industry
it is also evident between international partners and industry
and of course the payoff is this is a spectrogram the counts per bin number of photons per energy level
and as you can tell very sharp and very well defined peaks for where those lines are
next challenge was integrated testing
integration is always a challenge
how in the world are we going to integrate this whole thing
the logistics of who does what when we must choreograph it
here we have instrument a coming in
we have instrument b
we have the gratings coming in
we have the isim built at ball brothers
we have california building the optical bench
where are we all going to put this all together and test it out
that is always a challenge because again you have different players involved in different pieces
and you have got to make sure it all plays together
and the key there is to create a working group to make sure you address every aspect of integration
you plan very much ahead of time
you choreograph everybody coming in to make sure you have got everything covered
and in integration always always it takes longer than you think
you always plan assuming nothing is going to go wrong
this test takes this long and this test takes this long and this test takes this long
when in fact as is always the case you always have problems in testing
any time you are matching two boxes together especially electronically a lot of times you have problems
so testing is always something that you should make sure you have enough time to do troubleshooting
and plan for failures and not plan a success oriented schedule
even the best laid plans trw planned the integrated testing in a vacuum chamber
and during observatory integration trw couldn't hold the schedule because guess what the first thing that goes when you are in a money crunch is testing at the end
and you say why do that
because they say we had six months of margin in the schedule and you have eroded that margin
but that margin you haven't really defined anything to go into that margin
so hypothetically speaking if everything goes ok i don't need that
well so you take it off the table and it gets eaten away
and that is what happened
it got eaten away and couldn't hold schedule caused in this case by antiquated egse and software
but it is typical of a paradigm that says i create schedule you have got to try and preserve this schedule and fight tooth and nail to keep that reserve in every step of the way because in integration test is where usually you get behind
when we got behind the recovery is daily focus on schedule
every day we were on the phone going over what was to occur that day twenty four hour operations one year before launch continuing all the way around the clock
we changed the i and t integration and test lead out at trw
we brought marshall nasa engineers into help trw do it
and we had a technical presence help out at the test site
we have a contractor we hire a contractor and the contractor is supposed to do the job
and low and behold the contractor is not doing the job
so we could take a step back and say whack them on the head you are not doing the job
or you can go in and say we have got to get this job done
we are going to go and we are going to send folks over there that are technical folks that will help your guys work these problems and work the issues and work the integration and get this thing done
and so that is what we did
that is kind of a typical schedule
we have a comprehensive acceptance test
that is just a functional test going through all of the paces
emi is your kind of electrical susceptibility to noise
when you have a palm pilot or a cell phone and it is near a computer or near some device you hear this chattering
that is what that test is all about to look at interference patterns and look at whether you are susceptible to noise
we have an end to end test
that is where we get a compatibility van
and we make sure that we can communicate with the deep space network dishes in goldstone and madrid and canberra
that is our pointing at control systems polarity test
did we mount the gyro correctly or is it upside down
did we mount the reaction wheel correctly
do i have the spin vector pointed this way or pointed that way
you think that is pretty simple but in fact on the box it doesn't say arrow pointing up
you have to actually test it out
and nasa has screwed it up before
we do an acoustic test and then a pyroshock test
acoustic is you blast it with acoustic noise and the noise couples and creates vibrations
especially you are worried about thin films and large surface areas that are exposed to the noise pattern the wave front
so we painted the whole spacecraft with a huge woofer
i mean it was enormous
just to see the vibration and what would happen to make sure that it was ok
and we have the solar ray full motion test and the low gain antenna release test
we have mechanisms which are typically things that fail a lot or don't operate the way you thought
we want to test those hopefully in the environment that they would see in orbit
that means if it is cold if it is exposed to a plasma we want to try and duplicate that on the ground
typically that is what we do with mechanisms
yeah
i was wondering if you had like a separate satellite that was forecasting and they kind of knew that
good question
typically in the old days when we had a lot of money we would build what is called a qualification article which is basically a test article for the whole thing
and the qualification article would match one for one the flight unit
and we would test the heck out of that qualification article
nowadays with money problems typically we don't do that
for selected components where we are worried about the design we will develop a qualification article at the element level
but typically we don't do it with whole spacecraft not anymore
although the one exception to that is the structural test article
usually spacecraft do build a structural test article that does look like the final flight design from the overall structure
and you get your mode shapes and your frequencies when you ring it and see how it performs
and you fold that back into your analysis
but that is probably the only case where you build a full test article for structural purposes
it would be nice if we could do that
the dod does that when they have a production of a thousand units but nasa nowadays cannot afford to build a whole complex ground test article
it would be nice but sometimes we just cannot do it
we will do it on a selected element level
hardly ever testing to failure
we talked about that with the shuttle because jr thompson was pointing out like with the main engines testing to failure was really critical for success
but remember that is a very different operating situation than a satellite where normally if the satellite can survive launch and the vibration and the vibration is tested the structural you know if that survives then the operating environment is a lot more benign
now what do though is we compensate for not testing to failure by testing with two our expected flight environment plus margin
analytically or based on previous data we determine what the environment is going to be
and we will add margin to that and we will test to those margins
most times we do pretty well
sometimes we don't but that is probably few and far between
and we have learned after forty years of how to apply margin to our best analysis or our best tools that define what the environment is going to be
so that kind of shows you starting in october eighty seven ending april ninety eight that was the plan
we actually took about nine months more than what you see there because of all the problems that we had
a key point is when you are pressed for time do not cut corners
we did review all the testing and we did not delete any testing that we considered was mandatory
and in fact we added systems testing to verify that we had total system performance that we knew what this thing was going to do
we also added some end to end testing in thermal vac and added much more end to end testing with the control center that will eventually operate
a lot of times you have in the integration and test time a different set of engineers testing this than will actually operate it in flight
probably not a good idea
what you really want is to get your operators in flight operating and testing early enough that they can go through all of the gyrations of the testing environment and all of the idiosyncrasies of the hardware before flight so that they are trained on the hardware and they know how the hardware performs
and so if you can you want to try and get the operators to do the testing prior to launch
and a lot of times that isn't the case unfortunately
lesson learned
try to keep one integrated database along that theme of the control center for testing and operations because what you don't want to do is to have a database for testing that then you discard and you create a separate database for operations
it is much better to have one database so that you know what the parameters are
and once you have verified them in test they are the same parameters that you are using in flight
also to define an explicit test and integration lead review the approach encourage end to end testing participations of the operations group early and often and if you can get the operations group at the control center to run the tests
and give adequate time for box level testing and data system integrated testing
a lot of times what will happen is you're running late on schedule and at the box level i have a multiplexer
and i had scheduled at the box level probably three hundred hours worth of testing
well you know what i am running late
they are wanting me at the spacecraft level
well let me jip it up now
it has only had fifty hours but now i am going to the spacecraft
low and behold now what you have just done is you have moved the problem further on downstream when it is much more expensive and it costs you a lot more money
when i have a problem in integrated testing guess what
the whole spacecraft stops until i fix this box
if you can try and do it so that you have got enough margin that you can test at the small box level in parallel with all of the other boxes before you get to integrated testing
management
there were plenty of challenges in the management
and a term used is unknown unknowns
we didn't know at the time that money was going to be a problem with program restructuring
you don't know that you are going to have an integration delay
there are a lot of things that you really don't know
but nonetheless you have to expect for and you have to plan for
that is why at the beginning of a project you create what is called reserve resources
in terms of cost depending on the nature of the complexity the technology push you may have twenty percents to thirty percents of cost held in reserve
not applied anywhere because you don't know where the problems are going to occur
and you try as a project manager to hold onto that by tooth and nail and not release it if you can at all and only grudgingly allow reserves to be used
approach to success in that kind of environment is experience getting top management that has background and experience working closely with the science community
again focusing on teamwork
you will see that as a recurring theme
hold enough reserves so that when you are scoping out and you've got a lot of unknowns that you have enough money and time to do that
set it as high priority for the company or the organization that you are working for and set the schedule early and balance the need for maintaining schedule with the need to slow down and understand what your problems are rather than racing to the finish line
again these are some of the good lessons learned
in fact i just covered that one
this is what it ended up being the axaf schedule starting around calendar year ninety two with our srr
there is our pdr and there is our cdr
and the launch is even off the chart
but that is typically the kind of things that we go through including in parallel your control center development back down here
there is a mirror
all of this will be posted
i mean these are really valuable lessons
in fact any of you who eventually go into systems engineering and project management take some of these lessons learned with you
print them out and review them periodically
and remember them
they are lessons of hard knocks
what i am doing is now is i am now the project manager for a project or a mission called rlep two which is robotic lunar exploration program
and that mission will be the first mission that nasa has in a long time to land on the moon
we are going to land the lander
and we are going to have some type of mobility device that will either drive into a crater or hop into a crater or crawl into a crater or walk into a crater and look for lunar ice that we think might be there at the south pole
now this is a great example of how things are done
we are given a couple of requirements to say we want to verify our precision landing capability in an unmanned sense and we are going to use that technique and those algorithms for the future human lander
and we are also going to need you to go look at the ice
characterize it and see whether or not ice is there
now why is ice so important
ice is important because of the oxygen that you can get from the ice
and the oxygen is not so much to breathe but it is for fuel or for oxidizer for propulsion systems
instead of getting it at the earth's gravity well you get it at the gravity well of the moon
that is our challenge
now when they asked that nasa didn't exactly know what it would cost or what the cost profile would be
they originally designed it for a dollars four hundred million mission
they said well why don't you look at a dollars seven hundred fifty million solution
they don't know how many objectives we can meet
this rlep is supposed to be robotic lunar exploration
it is really a precursor to the human missions so they are not even sure how to use this program to help bring humans there
and so this is typical
nasa doesn't exactly know what it wants to do but it kind of puts out feelers to say try this
it says go start with this go touch the lunar surface characterize precision landing and go see if there is ice there
well go see if there is ice there
i can do that with one hop into the crater one sample and hopefully if the ice is there i can find it
or on the other extreme i can go with a rover spend a year in the crater take a thousand measurements and characterize the ice
obviously one cost a lot more than the other
so how in the world do you answer that question
which one should you do and whether it should be a mix
those are the very things facing the project that i am working on now
not only that one of the things is we are trying to get prepared for a human mission and we want to reduce the overall cost and reduce the risk
we would like to bring risk forward from the manned lunar mission into the rlep program and retire it in the robotics program
what that means is if i have a technology challenge for a cryogenic engine that means a liquid oxygen liquid hydrogen engine for the lunar descent i want to use that same engine if i can on this mission to work out the kinks
but how much is that worth to nasa
if that cost an extra dollars one hundred million for rlep is it worth it
there is no set answer
and so what we are doing right now is what is called a pre phase a
much like i showed you on chandra where you had that initial design and a final design we propose to headquarters with one design
it happened to have a rover
it was nuclear powered
we went into the crater
and we stayed there for quite a while
and we definitely characterized what was there
but it was expensive
is that the right answer
we don't know
we are right now going through a pre phase a that we are looking at other options
we are looking at kind of three classes of sizes
different solutions to get into the crater
different solutions on the size of the lander
its extensibility to the human mission
like for instance right now we use russian progress vehicles to resupply space station
we hope to design a robotic lander that would do the same thing during human missions
it is not man rated it won't fly men but it can fly supplies to the moon with one design
but that cost money because now i am not optimizing design for a point solution mission
so during this timeframe there are a lot of unknown questions
and the answers are not straightforward
so what we are doing is we are giving a series of options and rationale and capabilities for those options to headquarters
and we will make a recommendation as to what we think is the best answer for nasa to go forward with this design and here are the reasons
but it could very well be that they choose something different because there is no definitive solution to this problem or this challenge if you will
so it is very challenging
it is going to look probably a lot different now than it will when we actually launch it in two thousand ten or two thousand eleven but it is something that we face now
and it is more defined by how much money you can use versus what the requirements are
sometimes the requirements do set pretty much the basic tenets of the mission but other times it is driven by cost
and so right now we are in the middle of working that interesting and challenge problem for headquarters to develop what we think that mission should look like
and as you can envision you don't really have requirements
you have a few requirements
you have a desirability to reduce the overall cost and reduce the overall risk of a human mission
but that desirability comes with a cost
the more extensible you get to the human mission yes you can make a big lander that gives you two thousand kilograms of payload but it is going to cost you more
i can make one thousand kilograms of payload or five hundred kilograms of payload and get the definition of what is in the ice
but then later on i will have to design a new lander for getting other things accomplished that i want to get to on the moon
and is that the right answer
you can tell that there are a lot of challenges with that
any questions
we talked about the cost performance and schedule triangle
do you have a sense inside nasa of how much they are pushing schedule at this point where is your flexibility
in their solicitation to the centers they allowed schedule flexibility
they allowed cost flexibility
other programs i will say are generally more bounded than this one
this one is a matter of nasa not knowing exactly what the reason and what the purpose of the program is for
you've got this general idea of going back to the moon using robots first to prepare for humans but exactly what does that mean and exactly how do you prepare for humans and how much is it going to cost and when is it going to launch and how many missions are you going to have
they are all undefined
now what we would do is we have already gone to the program that will fund the human missions to say what do you guys plan to do and what do you want to do when you get there
so we can take their mission design and say how can we help
we can help here
we can help here
we can pull this technology forward and fly it
the problem there is that they haven't thought that far ahead
they don't know exactly what they are going to do
and a lot of that is is there ice there or not
if there is ice there we will want to process it
we will want to extract oxygen from it
as part of our solution we do know that we have to answer that question
we also do know that we do have to demonstrate precision landing
but above that they have given us a target date of two thousand ten to two thousand eleven
but they said schedule is not fixed
they have given us a cost generally between dollars four hundred and dollars seven hundred fifty million
and by the way if you can leverage areas of the budget to help your mission do that in particular technology
there is a separate technology budget
if i can get technology to pay for a new technology development at no cost to the program then i will do that
and again if we come in and say we have dollars one billion but it buys you dollars three billion when the crew is ready to come we think that is worth the investment
and then headquarters has to scratch their head and figure out whether it is really worth minimizing the long term cost versus the yearly constraint that they are given by congress and the pressures of shuttle and the pressures of stations on the overall cost of the program to nasa
it is real challenging
it is a lot of fun
we are going to have a blast
the next one is going back to the moon and you will probably hear more about it in the next couple of years
ok
thank you
this was really the last of the lectures on systems engineering per se
thursday is the last external lecture
gordon fullerton will be talking about test flying the shuttle
and hopefully by then i will have the schedule for the presentations next tuesday
in that case i will move on to introduce colonel gordon fullerton who got is bachelor's and master's degree from caltech in mechanical engineering did rotc and went on to the air force where well i guess he has flown in the course of his career about one hundred thirty five different types of airplanes sixteen thousand flying hours
he flew f eighty six interceptors b forty seven bombers before going to air force test pilot school in the mid sixty s
in sixty six he was chosen by the air force for the manned orbiting laboratory which was going to be the air force's space station
that program was cancelled in one thousand nine hundred sixty nine and the mol well some of the mol astronauts came over to nasa and became nasa astronauts
that was in the heyday of apollo
and gordon was support crew on the last four apollo missions
then went on to be the test pilot on three of the first five approach and landing tests
if you remember that is when the shuttle enterprise which was not designed for orbital flight but was designed to test basically the last fifty thousand feet down to the ground was dropped from the seven hundred forty seven
went onto pilot the third shuttle flight which was one of the orbital flight tests
that was the flight which landed in new mexico
and then commanded sts fifty one f which was the first flight of the instrument pointing system
that was also the flight i am trying to think where you lost the engine which we talked about
that was the one flight where we had an engine shutdown
and we went over that in some detail
i think they should hear about it from what it seemed like inside the cockpit now that they have heard kind of the technical details
in any case after leaving the astronautic office gordon has moved into pilot's heaven which is edwards air force base the dryden test flight center where he basically spends all his time
well not all of his time because there is management stuff as well
unfortunately that is the price you pay
but basically he gets to fly airplanes for a living
and lots of different kinds including the career aircraft and the b fifty two which launches various test aircraft and a whole bunch of other airplanes
if you remember in the whole systems engineering approach to things we talk about the conceived design manufacture test and operation
so this is basically the final lecture and this is the test and operation of the space shuttle from a pilot's point of view
so with that i will give it to you gordon
thanks
i was sitting at your place back in one thousand nine hundred fifty eight when i was a grad student at caltech for a year before heading off to the air force
wow almost fifty years ago
but the real blessing of my life is to be able to do what i love to do for as long as i have done it beyond all reason
anyway i hope to share some of that with you this morning
this is my first time through this pitch
feel free to holler out any questions as we go and we will stumble through it together
i planned to talk about three different phases of the orbiter test program
the first were called alt the approach and landing test that consisted of really thirteen flights five captive inert flights where the enterprise was flown on top of the seven hundred forty seven but nobody in the cockpit
the controls were locked
that was to clear the envelope for the kind of unlikely looking combination of a seven hundred forty seven with an orbiter on top
and then there were three captive active flights where we were manned up in the orbiter with the systems running the electronics the hydraulics were active
the controls were free to move a little bit not full throw
and we also determined how high the combination could get
because altitude was not fifty thousand feet it was more like twenty eight thousand feet max even with the seven hundred forty seven engines over boosted
followed by three free flights were we actually pushed the button munched off the top and glided to a landing
the orbital flight test prior to the shuttle program oft consisted of four flights
sts one through four of varying durations
sts one was planned for just a couple days to get up and get down and have a look at how things looked after it flew
sts two was supposed to be five days
they had a fuel cell problem that cut their flight short unfortunately for the crew
then i was on sts three
we were scheduled for seven days
and because of a raging dust storm at the planned landing site we got an extra day
a real blessing
with no tests to do we had a free day on orbit
and ended up with eight days
sts four planned and flew seven days landing on the fourth of july with president reagan out there to watch
and then we got into operational flights of which there had been a lot
something over a hundred
the last flight to fly the return to flight was sts one hundred fourteen but the number system went through a couple of phases
there have not been one hundred fourteen flights
i don't know how many it has been but there had been a bunch
i will talk about three well more than three flights but the alt flights
if you have to have a crew patch that is a major hurdle that you have to overcome
when you are assigned to a crew get the patch designed and then get it approved by upper management
part of the oft sts three in one thousand nine hundred eighty two and finally then an operational flight fifty one f in one thousand nine hundred eighty five
prior to any of these flights i worked into a dream job for really systems engineering
i guess and for a pilot
i had been to test pilot school
i was intrigued with all the airplanes i flew with a cockpit design and was very aware of the flaws of cockpit design
it seems like sometimes engineers lie awake nights trying to make it hard to operate subsystems
i got in at the beginning of the orbiter crew interface and became before it was over sort of the czar who was responsible to sign off all the drawings lots of reviews
it was a great responsibility because i was immediately and early into subsystem design because you have to know what the subsystem does to make any intelligent choice of what the controls and displays should be
this is a view of not the enterprise but probably i don't know whether it is a simulator or the real airplane they look alike but one of the orbital capable shuttles
this is like the little old ladies always say when you're out on display for armed forces day and look at all the things how do you remember what they all do
well that really is a challenge to make things straightforward
and i became painfully aware especially later on when we had a lot of experiments coming in that engineers in their little ivory tower building a system in the lab are so totally personally familiar with how their stuff works that it doesn't bother them that the switches are unlabeled or labeled illogically
and they bring that all in and want to put it in the orbiter
and when the crew says wait a minute i have to remember before i turn on switch a switch c and d have got to be turned on in this order or the whole thing will blow up
and they say oh yeah that is the way it is
and they know it so well personally
and yet when you are overwhelmed with a whole lot of experiments i am sure you ran into it on your flight that all the stuff that is just totally familiar to the guy that invented it becomes a challenge when you are faced with a whole lot of them and a limited amount of time to learn it
and so standardization of what the scheme especially in the software
while there are a lot of gadgets in fact if you count all the switches gauges circuit breakers upstairs downstairs and the mid deck there are about two thousand one hundred total in the orbiter cockpit
but the real challenge is what shows up on the screens here
so the software was a bigger thing in making them all play together
here is a higher view in the overhead panel above your head
and the forward cockpit has a lot of other switches
an example of what i am talking about this array of switches right here controls the reaction control system valving and then the orbital maneuvering system
back in apollo which i worked on when i first came to johnson space center i learned while lying many hours in the apollo crew simulator that that had the worst cockpit every designed by man
as an example it had a helium pressurization system to push the propellants for the reaction control jets out of the tanks and then the valves that went to the various arrays of thrusters all around the command module
and one would think logically if you have something to turn on the helium you label that helium on off
and then the manifold the next branch in the christmas tree manifold would be system a versus system b or something like that
and in fact it had names like that
but they put the switches in a long room and labeled them a through h right there on the panel
no clue as to what you were throwing so every move you made in the cockpit some of these things were critical required you to either be a metal giant or open a checklist and say to pressurize system b i have got to throw b on and then a next and then h last or something like that
obviously unacceptable
it became my career and mania to try to improve that
the first orbiter simulator built was called the oas orbiter aeroflight simulator
it was on a moving based platform like the standard airline simulators you see today
this is fred hayes and i sitting in the cockpit
this one was built originally to be the enterprise
and the enterprise was ov one hundred one in the scheme of things a numbering of orbiters as they were built one hundred one had only the systems it needed to fly the approach and landing test
the plan was to retrofit it later to make it into orbit capable
but before the alt program it had just what you needed and only that to fly in the atmosphere very short flights
but this is our first chance to look at what we had and what we were getting into as far as pilot concerns
now i guess you have had all the subsystems right
you were all completely briefed and experts on subsystems by the people that had preceded me here in the course
i will give you though a quick review here the avionics system
the shuttle is build with inside the outer mole line as the pressure vessel that is roughly back to the forward bulkhead of the payload bay and is imbedded inside basically aluminum structure with a thermal protection system applied to the outside
and most of the avionics are in racks right up here right in there with you in the cockpit on the middeck
the stowage lockers are aft of the racks full of black boxes and lots of wires
and the other place there were avionics is back here just after the aft bulkhead of the payload bay
and there are some areas where they put items like rate gyros and accelerometers
a lot way back
from a systems engineering standpoint fred hayes and i were out at palmdale where they built all the orbiters
it seems like the testing always happens after two point zero am tests would run around the clock
and we were out there way after midnight in the cockpit participating in the first time they were going to close the loop between the rate gyros and the flight control system which is contained back up here in the nose and the general purpose computers
the whole orbiter was suspended on some big airfield bag so it had compliance to move
and the hydraulic system was on powered by a facility hydraulic source
the elevons were powered and the rudder speed brake was powered and the process let us down for the very first time that we were going to close the loop between the software up here and the rate gyros particularly and accelerometers mounted in the back
and it was a milestone
and we had people stationed around the back to see if anything spit out hydraulic fluid or whatever
anyway we went up to the glass shield and pushed the button to go into css control stick steering which hooked the stick up now to the flight control system
i will never forget
we pushed the button and a rumble started
and the rumble built very rapidly to a violent rumble
i mean we were being bounced around the cockpit
this is one hundred fifty thousand pounds of airplane dancing on these rubber bags
and it didn't take us long to say this doesn't feel good
we pulled the button that downloads back to direct control so there is no feedback
and the upshot of it was that these rate gyros are mounted on this flexible bulkhead
and that had been taken into account properly
and so there was a structural resonance that was just diversion
in spite of all the grounds tests down at downy and the iron bird mockups and everything when we put it in the real airplane it tried to jump off the supports
and fred and i were in the cockpit our eyes were big and we called the control room which were people back in an adjacent room
it seems like most spacecraft tests traditionally are done with engineers all locked up in windowless room no view of the real hardware
down at the cape they are miles away when the spacecraft is either out on the pad or in the main checkout building
and so they said no the procedure says this is ok and we want you to re engage
we tried one more time
and this time the guy stationed in back that were watching said this doesn't look good
they started hollering on the loop so we pitched it off
and we went into a raging argument
we need to complete this test the engineers were saying
and we were saying we don't want to break something
and they got people out of bed down in california controls engineers
and so it was a memorable night
the resolution was finally a redesign of the mounting area back there and reanalysis of the vibrational modes of the aft bulkhead sorted all out
here is what we had for a crew interface
you saw in the earlier picture upfront three crts monochrome green it was either green or nothing on the screen and we had two keyboards three crts
there was always this little concern when you are punching on a keyboard you want to be sure it is selected to the crt you think you are doing something on
another marginal design but that is what we ended up with
you notice we have a hexadecimal keyboard here
we have some strange keys called item and electric and ops which had to do with this truly unique way you cause things to happen through software
and lots of things were critical through software
and then this rather dim green screen
this was way before the days i guess bill gates was still here at mit or maybe even hadn't registered yet
i don't know
it was way before windows one point zero
and so it seems almost comical now when you compare it to even modern airliner crew interface with glass cockpits but we were breaking new ground here
and it even at the time seemed antiquated because that is all they were willing to embrace in the way of computer control and design
and it was unique
and it causes lots of headaches and delays
the big thing about the orbiter with its data process system the decision was made that everything is going to be done with these all powerful general purpose computers in which there were five in an array that worked together
flight control system management navigation inertial subsystem control of everything
and so the result was the software loads as they were built had lots of flaws when they came down yet we couldn't fix them
we had cases as dumb as a display that showed the freon loop a pump on
and when it got through the entire software belt it was backwards
it would say off when it was really on
seems like a simple fix right
go back to the programmer and rewrite the code
but we couldn't do it
we had to live with it for a long period of time through training until another whole load was built
because the load that would fix this dumb little bi level mistake was also the one that steered you during ascent
so everything was frozen and there was great fear of changing anything that would ricochet through to something truly critical
and so even when we got to sts three we flew with a book about this thick of program notes that told you line after line what was wrong what was backwards what was a trap
and really a big challenge to the crew to embrace and live with because there just wasn't time in the program to build another load check it out through all the different labs that had to certify it
that is load for modular software where you can change something here and be assured you are not bollixing up something else in the same machine
oms rcs
these are the two pods
on either side of the vertical tail are a couple big oms propellant tanks oxidizer and fuel hypergolic
we didn't need any ignition system
as soon as these came together in a thruster you had thrust
and there were i think forty four main thrusters
here are four yaw jets firing out to the side
s and b pitch jets
the same thing repeated on the other side
and up in the nose are the forward rcs
they had jets that fired up and out to the side and down
and i mentioned the controls in the cockpit which we did
one of my great successes was getting the orbiter panels to be arranged in a plumbing layout so that you could see what you were pressurizing when you turned on the helium for a given let and that sort of thing
helium tanks are what pressurized in a really cleaver system of oh control
that is when you are in zero g and you have propellant floating around randomly
and you turn on the helium to push it toward the outlet
if the outlet is uncovered the helium is going to squirt right out
but they had an elaborate system of surface tension kind of baffles that kept and trapped fuel near the outlet of the tank so that when the thrust came on and all the propellant went down where it should it sort of recharged this chamber at the bottom of the tanks to keep it flowing smoothly and not lose all the pressurization
i remember my first impression of what reaction control jets would be like was based on science fiction movies where you would see the spacecraft out there and there were little squirts of jets that nudge you around
and we went out to the ground test facility at white sands on a fieldtrip out there where they actually had the forward rcs setup and they were going to do real firings of the main jets out there
and we were probably a couple hundred feet away from the test setup
we were out there waiting for this sequence of jet firing to start on a test
and the first firing of one of the main jets which are right up around nine hundred pounds thrust was just this short pulse
and everybody went about three feet off the ground
i mean it was like you fired a howitzer
it was just stunning
wham wham and it just blew you away
and the realization of we are going to be in the cockpit here and these things are firing right outside the windshield
they did
in space the ignition transient ricochets through the structure
you can hear this kind of bombing effect
but once they are on if it is a long duration firing it is silent
and the same way visually you can see a flash when the fuel is led a little bit in front of the oxidizer to make sure you don't overheat something
and so there is incomplete combustion at the ignition
you can see a flash go out there
but what is on during an oms burn for instance when these oms engines are firing and you are looking back at the aft you see the flash and they are on and they are pushing and you can feel it
but otherwise invisible is the way i remember
on the other hand there are vernier jets little guys
i don't know if they are shown here
but there are little twenty five pound thrusters or something used ninety eight percents of the time on orbit
you really are doing that kind of thing with the vernier jets
and you cannot hear those or see anything when they are going off
in fact we got everybody quiet and kind of held onto the walls just trying to see if we could barely detect when a vernier jet fired physically in a cockpit
interesting
the orbiter is one giant heat transfer machine
lots of calories of heat energy pumped around from one end to the other
and so there are water loops within the cabin that transfer the heat to freon loops
the fluid is pumped through the radiators to reject heat
in spite of all these heat rejection systems then there are heaters everywhere whole banks of heaters to keep stuff from freezing
then for the landing and takeoff phases there are flash evaporators that flash water and or ammonia
when you are down in the atmosphere you use ammonia to cool the loops
and of course the payload bay doors are closed
and it turns out sts three a major test of it was test all these loops and how the structure responded to long durations of given attitudes with the sun shining on one side and cold space on the other side and how the structure would distort or hopefully not distort and how all that system would work
as it turned out if you like lots of redundancy this is probably the weak point i thought in the whole orbiter design we've got three engines
we proved that you can get there with only two
but the freon loops there were two redundant through the radiators
and if one freon loop pumped quick you are in a severe emergency
that means stop everything and power down severely
turn off all the computers except one get in a proper attitude and go into a panic reconfiguration to come back and land
originally the design had three freon loops
it could use one and go on with no concern
but as it turned out the heat loads were so high and the weight criticality determined that all we had electrical power to run were two loops
and so we ended up with a single freon loop which fortunately as far as i know never failed
but if it had it would have been a crash deorbit landing under severely powered down conditions
while it is kind of mundane and people don't think about it as a primary system the thermal control really was critical
payload bay doors this is a busy chart but indicates these are really complicated sixty feet long and something like one hundred twenty little motor driven latches to latch them closed
and you don't just go chunk close like the bomb bay on a b fifty two and it is closed
to close the payload bay doors you get them close and then the latches along the bulked all in a zipper fashion have to sequentially close
and then you go down the center section to latch the two left and right doors together
all software controlled
and there was a lot of concern that we address on sts three particularly about whether this is all going to work
if you have been floating around with these pointed to dark space would they distort to where the zipper scheme would work
we worried about it enough that part of our emergency training contingency training
a lot of time was spent underwater in the neutral buoyancy tank looking at a system going out eva with a series of come alongs you know the kind of things you use to pull the motor out a car that kind of thing that we could go down there and hookup and latch the doors shut to actually manually get them shut and then latch them shut with these
fortunately that has never been used
and this complex system has worked good but it was scary the first time we flew it on sts three
that was a big concern
what i have got here is hydraulic system
hydraulics are hydrazine powered turbines that run at some ridiculous rpm like two hundred thousand rpm to drive hydraulic pumps back here in the backend
and then they are crucial during launch because they have got to hold the elevons in position
but they also have to provide the muscle to gimbal the main engines and keep you steering straight during launch
during entry they are what you use to fly when you get into a dynamic pressure situation
control the rudder speed brake and the body flap
the body flap is a big surface that sticks out underneath the main engine bells and is a slow moving trem device
the body flat is always moved
you go through this mach twenty five to mach zero envelope
and the trem conditions necessary with these big elevons varies a lot
so to desaturate the elevons and keep them basically faired with the wing the body flap is your trim device
and it is like this row of tables long and this wide
i remember asking to see the motor
it is driven by a whole lot of mechanical advantage by a hydraulic motor
a guy took me around
i couldn't find the actuator for the body flap
he showed me
the motor was this big around and this long a little hydraulic motor
so you can do anything with mechanical advantage
but it didn't have to move very fast
finally on the system pictures here the rms
hopefully you have heard about this
it was built by spara up in canada
the canadians main contribution to the orbiter program
a pretty magical device
it can go on either side but for our flights mounted on the left hand side or the right if you're looking out the back windows at it
and it had joints logically called the shoulder joint elbow wrist joint
all electric motor driven
but the interesting thing was a control
you had hand controllers mounted in the aft part on the right console in the back where you looked out
and you could work in the mode where you actually drive in the end left right up down in out without regard to whatever joint was done
that is all resolved by the software
and worked well
the end effector was a cleaver kind of a hallow cylindrical device
it would rotate inside and three cables that would be curved around the periphery inside this cavity when activated
i put this over a post on whatever you wanted to grab onto with a knob on the end
you go over the post and then rotate the inner barrel and the cables would wrap up and grab onto the post
and then they would retract in to rigidize
and that was the grabber on the rms
and we flew this on sts three
i will show you later
anyway that is the subsystem review
let me show you how things went during approach and landing tests
now let's see
i have never figured out how to imbed video and powerpoint so i am going to be doing it manually
any questions while we are waiting on this to come up
well this is the desert around where i live and a gila monster and a joshua tree to set the scene
and here you have ov one hundred one
the numbering system as it turned out is kind of interesting
they built ov ninety nine as the structural test article
it was strictly built to be in the lab and do all the structural testing on it
one hundred one then was the first orbiter build the enterprise being hauled from palmdale across the backgrounds and the desert roads to get over to edwards in these scenes
and one hundred one was the alt airplane
you can see kind of phony looking rcs
it has as i mentioned only the systems that you needed to fly atmospheric flight
this was a big thing getting it across the country
it had a pitot boom on it
it has just simulated thermal protection
styrofoam painted to look kind of like they thought the space vehicles would look but wasn't real
it was put in the mating and docking device which is at nasa dryden where i work now
hoisted it up
and then the seven hundred forty seven and nine hundred five the first shuttle carrier aircraft was pulled under and they mated them up
i remember flying out to edwards and seeing this unlikely combination
and the first time i saw the two together i thought they cannot be serious
but then i realized i was going to be in it
there were thirteen total flights
this is a taxi test
when you have an aerodynamic test you can sneak up and so you do baby steps
this was just a high speed down the runway to see if it would rotate and if anything would shake alarmingly
and that will look good
preparations proceeded for the first of the captive inert flights
this is fitz fulton and tom mcmurtry both real good friends and they were the crew on the seven hundred forty seven for this first milestone flight
a lot of people were out watching and wondering if it would fly which it did very well
and off it went
you notice a longer front attached structure there
and the orbiter is purposely on there at angle of attack to produce lift
i flew a seven hundred forty seven for ferry flights now and to haul orbiters back to the cape when they land at edwards as the last one did
and the nose that front bipod is much shorter so that the orbiter is down for less drag for the combination
but this setup here was so that we could get the orbiter off the top and not the tail
there is a rumble
the crew noticed a shaking
it is still the case when you fly
these vertical fins were added onto the horizontal stabs to increase directional stability because the orbiter blanks a lot of flow over the normal vertical
in fact they overdid it a little bit
there is too much structural stability which has resulted in the weird situation
your cross wind limit when you have an orbiter onboard is greater than when it is not because you have so much directional stability and a crosswind
there is a strong weathervaning and you run out of normal rudder without an orbiter so you are good only to fifteen knots crosswind with the orbiter on
the limit is twenty knots
and it is a good limit
i have flown them both ways in cross winds
and indeed at those numbers you run out of rudder as you land and are rolling out
the strong weathervane intensity is leading you out this side of the runway
anyway that looked good
and so i came back and we had a big post flight party
alt was great for parties
we had thirteen post flight parties
and at the same time we were doing the alt flights we are developing a shuttle training aircraft
this is gulfstream ii with big side force generators on the belly
that is an airborne simulator
the left seat is set up with orbiter instruments
and the right seat was the standard gulfstream cockpit that had flown thousands of dives at the ground in the sga preparing for the whole idea of first time for sure unpowered landing that you have to do right the first time
and back in the simulator here for lots more runs
and it was a great time because everything was brand new very interesting
this is a camera and an actual model
this is before the days of computer generated video
it flew the little camera down to landing
and we learned a lot about characteristics
one that we really wondered about when you made a lateral input to roll the orbiter in the simulator it would bang you
it was this lateral lurch we call it
it would jolt you sideways
and we thought this cannot be real
it doesn't make any sense
no airplane we ever flew does that
we squawked it
they came back and said the equations are all worked out so we live with it and thought it was just an artifact that snuck in there and didn't worry about it
now the captive active started where we actually got in and cranked things up
on the second flight i was chasing in a t thirty eight
and engle and truly were in the cockpit
and i noticed a shiny look on the side
that big x on the crt is what happens when the computer that is driving that crt quits
that is sort of the panic symbol when the x shows up
anyway i noticed a leak as it turned out to be
we had that severe hydrazine leak
hydrazine is bad stuff to have leaking
and one of the apu supply tanks let go
plus they had an over temp
we found things that were wrong that made these captive flights worthwhile
if we had just gone and launched off on the first one it could have been more exciting than it needed to be
we had five of those
and fred hayes and i got the odd numbered flights one three and five
five more post flight parties
and then we decided we were ready to go
well this is the last of the captive active flights
the scheme by which we plan to get off of here and not take off the tail of the seven hundred forty seven was that the seven hundred forty seven would go as high as it could go
it could get up to around twenty seven thousand feet with engines over boosted
pratt and whitney said you could go this long with extra power
and then nose over and speed up to two hundred forty knots
it was climbing maybe to one hundred ninety point two hundred knots
with a little downhill push we got up to two hundred forty
at two hundred forty the sea pilots would go to idle power and air brakes up to put drag on the carrier
at that condition of two hundred forty knots and the angle of attack of the orbiter it was actually lifting more than its own weight
so the result is we really dropped the carrier as it turns out
there is three quarters of a g difference between the two
and so we got a lot of use
for some reason fred's left shoulder he is in the left seat and he mashed the separation button after fitz on the carrier aircraft hollered carrier ready that is they were back at idle with the speed brakes up pushed the go button and bang all seven explosive bolts would blow
control room was in houston strange enough
we are talking to people back in the old jsc control room when we are out at edwards flying these flights
it was just like they were there
and we were coming up on a condition
and this was in august of seventy seven
all the alt flights happened in one thousand nine hundred seventy seven
you notice there is a tail cone on here
the tail cone was flown on the first three flights
that makes a big difference
it smoothes the flow s that the buffet on the tail the carrier aircraft was less and it just about doubled the l d of the orbiter
we are going to arm
and we had two chases one off to the right and in trail separation
just like the engineer said and the load cells that we had on there testing exactly which was the thing tugging before we did it said we could do straight up
this is slow motion
nothing is leaking
the vortex is out at the wing tips causing condensation and away we went
and simultaneous with this bang that shutters through the airplane with all these explosive volts a big x on the crt in front of me
we had cue cards and we had practiced this
my job while fred flew he actually got a vertical clear from this chase pilot and then rolled into a bank and a lateral clear from the guy that was chasing from behind and knew that it was ok to push over
because we are only now at two hundred knots and we wanted to get to three hundred
and it took a considerable pushover to get up to speed
meanwhile i am pulling circuit breakers on rate gyros and turning off accelerometers at our preplanned procedure to accommodate flaws in the redundancy management
when you lose one computer you also take out part of the sensors in the flight control system
and to be sure that a subsequent failure wouldn't put you in worse shape it took about a minute's worth of manual reconfiguration on my part
and i kind of missed the whole first part of the flight
when i turned around i realized hey this thing is flying good it is smooth and is on speed
and fred was flying
we flew a rectangular pattern out of a downwind leg here as we nosed over
and i got my chance to roll into a left ninety degree turn and fly base leg
and as i put the stick over to roll we got this big lateral arch just like the simulator said
it just stunned me
son of a gun they were right after all
it was just the nature of something flying at high alpha and rotating about a stability axis and the cockpit gets slid sideways
it has big elevons so it flies like a fighter
it really does
and you are doing it all with a little stick that doesn't move much
anyway we came down final at two hundred ninety i think it was flared out
my job was to put the gear down a critical function
and we are landing on lakebed one seven on the dry lake at edwards which is something like ten miles long so we have pretty good margins there
and fred took the airplane back from alt and i got to fly base leg
but we touched down at about one hundred eighty five i think it was nice and smooth
it was beautiful
the speed brake comes out to help cushion the de rotation nose gear down and he raised a little dust as he rolled to a stop
so it was a good day
now we had a really good post flight party after this one
and see the rudder speed brake flared there and the elevons fold up
and so now fred truly did it again
a couple weeks later or thereabouts they got their turn and they did much the same flight repeated it
oh one thing
you see the pitot boom out there
the pitot boom is strictly on the enterprise put out there to get good air data out in front of this big blivit of an airplane which is hard to get good measurements
let me get the next one going here if i can figure out how to get out of this
the excitement came later
on sts one i looked out there when were on final i had to look out and look at the pitot boom and it is going through an arch of about three feet
it was built with the perfect resonance of everything else with the airplane and it was just a blur out there going back and forth
and i really thought it was going to break off
was that your only pitot source or did you have the normal ones
good question
somehow we had at least inertially derived ones
everything looked good
and actually it still put out good airspeed even though it was a blur
and i think the beta averaged out
anyway it wasn't a problem we noticed other than visually it looked like it was going to break off
they changed and stiffened it up so it wasn't a problem on subsequent flights
now you can see here we are at free flight four now which was the other crew's turn
the tail cone is off and our final pressure glide slope with the tail cone on was eleven degrees
with tail cone off it was twenty three degrees halves your l d
so you really are in a steep dive
normal ils into logan out here would be two point five degrees so you are coming down gangbusters
and it is even worse in alt than it was in the orbital missions which were coming down with the same configuration but much heavier
heavier you've got more gravity working for you and you can fly shallower
it doesn't seem to figure but that is the way it is
so nineteen degrees is a normal return from orbit
final pressure glide slope we were up in the twenty s
kind of catching up a little
one of our jobs on the flight preceding this was to try the braking
we just let it roll out on the first couple flights
they wanted to do brake tests
and fred jumped on the brakes after we touched down and another resonance problem interaction between the structure and the anti skid and i thought it was going to break the airplane
it was just violent shuttering shaking everything rattling in the cockpit
and i hollered to fred get off the brakes we are going to brake something
he said no the card says we have got to do max braking
i was pleading with him to get off the brakes which he did
easy fix
when they flew the next flight here they did hard braking and it was smooth
they went in to change the resister and the feedback electrons and that did it
i mean it was instant fix
so there still is reason to do flight tests because surprises happen
now free flight five it turns out there was a little brake here
we are back at houston and prince charles who wasn't married yet at that time came by on a visit
and we gave him a ride in the simulator
he had some flying time
and he got into a horrendous pio
i mean he was out of control and crashed in the simulator
and felt bad
and we said that is because you're not used to the stick and everything
and that was his tour
now for this flight he was actually out along the runway
they had him out there so he could watch
the objective here was to land on the concrete runway put it right on the line there is a white line five thousand feet down and fred was really working at it putting in a lot of inputs
look at the elevons going there
you see them
and he is making roll commands
and so we logged a couple landings
and down and rolled to a stop
afterwards we called out and he came up to say hello
he said oh you made me feel good
you guys did as bad as i did
there he is right there with his binoculars
well that scared everybody to death
it looked worse from outside than it did in the cockpit
and the flight control flaw that we found though was serious
you've got elevons that do both pitch and roll
so in the software when you are asking for both pitch and roll at the same time it has got to decide which one do i move
this is just a supposition of what would come
the software had to give priority
and they decided to give priority to pitch
and roll was taken second priority when you had to limit the commands to the elevons to within the capability of the hydraulic system
the result was a lag in roll response when you are working pitch hard
and the lag was up around two tenths to three tenths of a second
you may be aware if you studied flight control systems
any kind of system that has a quarter second delay between input and response is asking for a pio pilot induced oscillation
and we had a big time in roll
fred was clanking back and forth to stop and roll trying to level the wings out there that first skip
i heard the controller banging over there
and i suggested if you get off maybe it will damp
we're doing this and sure enough that is what he did
he stopped the inputs the airplane damped right away and then it went ok
but it was something we had to fix obviously
here is a picture just a micro second after liftoff on one of the last two
well there was a decision with a lot of debate about do we go back and fix the flight control and fly some more alt
but this is a huge production and it was costing time and we weren't getting into orbit
a decision was made now we will do it in simulators and in flight simulators and fix the problem but press on
that was the end of alt at the end of which when you do flight tests you talk about opening the envelope of an airplane
well the envelope of the space shuttle is four hundred nautical miles altitude and mach twenty five
and in alt we got the four miles and zero point three mach
it is really down in the lower left corner but worth doing
test results
i mentioned as we went we had that apu fuel leak
fixed it
didn't come back
the buffet lifter drag was right on what we expected no surprises there
handling qualities were good even with the lurch
it was not a problem
i mentioned the pitot boom the anti skid
sca did the job although it struggled to get up
with the tail coming off it could only get to about eighteen thousand feet
so this was not a good program to build up your flying time
it was about a total in three flights of about twelve minutes of flying time
and the biggie i mentioned was the handling qualities and the pio tendency that we fixed with lots of studies later and changes in the way the control equations were written
and as a final thing they did some more flights with the nose lowered down and determine what the ferry flight performance of the combination is
i later after flying in space checked out on the seven hundred forty seven and still fly it on the ferry flights
and it does the job
it burns lots of gas
i figured out that the combination across the country the mileage is about three hundred feet per gallon so a football field per gallon of fuel forty thousand pounds an hour is the field flow
it goes about one point five times its own length when we get on the gas but it gets there
i don't have to buy the fuel
a lot of people said wasn't this scary alt
actually from a risk standpoint we had ejection seats
if anything had gone wrong anywhere along the line we could have pulled the handle and jumped out
the scariest part of it was when we got in and during the captive flights we would just walk up a stairway and crawl through the hatch
and the same way getting out
but after the captive active flights we would land still on the orbiter
and they had this cherry picker to get us out
now the situation here is it's a round hatch hedged at the bottom
they only wanted on person at a time on the end of this thing
you open a round hatch and then they bring this up the guy on the ground
and he doesn't want to get too close and ding so he leaves about this much of a gap from this round hatch which is sixty feet above the ground that you have got to crawl out on your knees then stand up and then make the leap across the thing onto this wobbly cage up there
that is how our captive actives went
where you wearing flight suits for all these tests
yeah we were wearing flight suits and helmets like you would in a five hundred eighteen or any fighter
not pressure suits
we didn't have a severe cabin pressure risk at twenty five thousand feet
let me get into the full screen mode here
i put in some thoughts about what is different when you test an aircraft versus a spacecraft
with an airplane you can do little baby steps incremental tests
you can do static runs of the propulsion up to the full power in the airplane itself
then you taxi it slow and then faster and faster down the runway
you can rotate the nose a little bit
the first flight you will fly slow and leave the gear down and then land it soon and check everything
and you could hold off for a perfect day to do it
and then you go faster and faster to expand the envelope
if anything goes wrong you can peel off and get back on the ground quick
and as i mentioned you can always pull the handle and bail out if things go really bad
when you have a spacecraft it is all or nothing
you have got to use the propulsion at its full power
all the critical systems and subsystems have got to work
you cannot make a quick abort
long delays like days are sometimes required to get back to the conditions where you can make an appropriate landing
and the weather could turn sour at the time
when you are going to flight test the spacecraft you have got to have a lot of redundancy in the design to allow for the bad day that has to carry it through in a considerable amount of time
you necessarily have got to test everything to the limit wind tunnels cvd thermal vacuum because the environment is lots more stressful
you have got to have a lot of instrumentation so that you can tell what did go wrong or be sure that everything went right
you are talking about an army of controllers in a control room to pull it off with a complex system like the shuttle
and lots of simulation to get everybody trained
a biggie is to verify the software
i mentioned the software is guaranteed to be wrong on the first release and several subsequent
it is just the nature of building software
and so getting that checked out is a major one
procedures
when we flew the orbital flight the stack of checklists just laid on top of each other was about this high for fifty one f and it weighed two hundred ten pounds
it was called the flight data file
and then lots of time and expense getting everybody really ready to go
and being sure that when you're going into an unknown part of the envelope that the margins on the flight control are adequate
so the surprises and the aeroderivatives that hit you can be accommodating
i have rambled on a long time here
we can take the five minute break i can answer questions however you want to do it
maybe it's time for a stretch
let's do a two minute break
these people are tough
all right
break is over
the next assignment for me was being put on an orbital flight test and specifically sts three
a two man crew jack lousma a marine and myself from the air force we were in pressure suits you will notice there and on ejection seats in the columbia
this is ov one hundred two point one hundred one was the enterprise one hundred two was the columbia
and our countdown went smoothly
this was in march of eighty two
and this is a signature moment in your life when the srbs light
i mean it looks smooth and nice as we are flying through a cloud here on launch logging weather time i might add but it is rough and noisy and rattley
and the acceleration is right away and it builds up to three gs
when the main engines are throttled back the whole three gs
and so it is no doubt you are on your way somewhere really fast wherever the solids want to go
everything worked good right up to meco
and the external tank as you saw drifted away
and then here come the first order of business opening the payload bay doors so we can start rejecting heat with the radiators that are mounted on the inside
we are tailed down
and as you watch here we are going right over los angeles at the time
this is just north of la
you can see la
sorry this is santa monica lax and palos verdes right there
anyway the first thing we had to do is get out of theodolite that is a sighting device that surveyors use and take a daunting number of readings on little targets that were pasted around inside the payload bay and on the doors to measure where they were
and we did that through the flight all the way along
it wasn't fast enough
out in front of the nose there were some dark patches
that is where tile were white tile and fell off during launch
they actually found some washed up on the beach
fortunately none of the black tile on the bottom fell off but we did lose some on the top
zero g is really one of the delights
there are two really good things about flying in orbit weightlessness and the view out the window
and that is like nothing that you experience even flying high performance airplanes
we had the rms cranked up
that was my job as rms operator
and we had a package in the back the plasma diagnostic package to grab and move out there
there are some things that show you the housekeeping area
in the corner there is the john
and long duration spaceflight exercise is important
it is really not a big deal on a seven day flight
jack is a marine as i mentioned
he has got to have his daily ration of pushups so here we go
how about a one handed pushup jack
how about a no handed pushup
this is a quick summary
we went our seven days
and the lakebed at edwards they had a really wet spring was unusable so we went to white sands new mexico
the first day right as we are about to light the oms engines to start deorbit they said hold off because this terrible dust storm is going on
and then we waited a delightful day with nothing in the flight plane much to enjoy ourselves and then came down the next day
now we find another gotcha in handling quantities here
right here jack thought the nose might be coming down too fast and tried to stop it and ended up doing a little wheelie
subsequent analysis showed that the whole response of the vehicle changes when you are down on the main gear only
and nobody thought of that
it would seem like well they are worried about pitch in the air but not while you are rolling on the main gear trying to de rotate
so it resulted in more software changes
another thing we learned they were pushing for auto land
we flew the whole turn onto final and down final hands off in auto land
the program wanted to take this out of the hands of the crew so here on the third flight they had us sitting there watching the airplane fly down to pre flare
and then the first chance jack got to grab the stick was at the last minute to do the flare and landing
and that was dumb when you look back really dumb
and so now all flight commanders if it has been auto down to forty thousand feet where you go subsonic we will fly manually all the way down to get a feel for the airplane
it makes a lot more sense
that is the way flights are done now
here is where we started from orbit
this is how cape canaveral looks
right here is the shuttle landing strip that is down there
you can see it
and the launch pads are these two dots
and so that is where usually a shuttle flight starts and ends
here is a picture of our payload bay on sts three
and we did have a payload
previous crews had pretty much empty payload bay but we had an environmental measurement thing a lot of instrumentation
then this pdp plasma diagnostic package that we actually had something to grab with the manipulator arm as you see here
i looked around and found i don't know if you can recognize this but that is cape cod back there
a picture of mit
not a good picture
there have got to be lots of better ones
and here is where we ended up the white sands area near alamogordo new mexico
what we learned this is a pretty cryptic summary
training was a real problem
the first two crews that flew sts one and sts two had all the attention of the training people in the simulators
they had priority properly so
we on the third flight had low priority and really struggled
and what we found when we got in the simulators is when they didn't work right nobody could explain why
many times we try on ascent and crash and burn
and you always were scratching your head is this real
is this the way the orbiter flies or is it some flaw in the simulator
early on you are developing not only the orbiter but the training facilities
and the people didn't understand the system
we had more exposure from alt to subsystems than the people that were supposed to be the experts
it was a group learning process and a long way from what happens now when crews go in
and they get the straight word right from the beginning on how things are
the tiles fell off
not good
they changed the bonding scheme improved the quality control and fortunately for the program no critical tiles fell off
but that was alarming
we looked out there we reported it took pictures of it looking at these gaps in the system right out in front of the windshield
but ground said don't worry that is a cool area during entry
entry is at forty degrees angle of attack so it is cool on top
they were right
everything was fine
another tile thing was after the flight actually delay that
it was really more after the next flight
i mentioned how the ride is
the first two minutes were rough and exciting
the next six or seven are unbelievably smooth when you get on the main engines and then more vibration that you are getting sitting in the chairs now
and it is just a steady relentless push
it is just a spectacular right
but you are back in the seat
had an apu oil overheat during that three g part
actually about two minutes before meco ground called and said we needed to shut down one apu
we were up past the point where we could live without all three apus running
i had a chance to test what i worked on years previously with the cockpit design
you are concerned about visibility when you are squashed in the seat at three gs and access
and the apu switches we had to put them down here
and i remember worrying specifically if we have got to get to the apu switches the guy on the right seat under three gs can he lift the helmet and look over there and find the correct switch
and you do not want to shut down the wrong one one of the good ones
and it turned out i guess with the adrenaline lifting this heavy helmet at three gs i did it without even thinking about it and went right to the switch
so it worked
general habitability was good in the orbiter
the first time anybody lived there for eight days
a good way to think about living in the orbiter think of it as a camping trip
you go on a camping trip you don't worry about hot water showers and all the niceties of home
you get in that frame of mind and it is fine
the food is adequate the facilities are ok although in our case the toilet ground to a halt
it is a drum that rotates to centrifugally sling all fecal material out and contain it
and it ground to a halt
we were in a real camping trip for a while on that although it worked out
the arm worked great rms
the main jets i mentioned earlier
of course you don't use the main jets much
it would be hard to sleep with them booming away but you use the verniers most of the time
verniers are critical to smooth operation over long periods of time
we spent a lot of time for instance tail sun
for like three days we put the tail right at the sun and stayed in that inertial attitude
and so it cooked the backend while the front end of the orbiter is cold
we took all the theodolite measurements opened and closed the doors
all of that worked fine
the systems handled it
a lot of it was ground analysis
and how the temperatures were were extensively instrumented
and we did notice a strange thing
not strange but it became apparent
when you are in orbit when you are on the sunny side of the earth as soon as the sun comes up it is high noon bright but there is no atmosphere around to diffuse the light
when we were at tail sun it is hidden behind perfectly eclipsed by the aft structure
and so there is no sun ball to be seen anywhere even though it is bright sunny from just the reflections of the structure you can see out the window
i noticed looking at the radiators which are very very smooth concave surfaces out there and shiny silver colored
it looked like there were bright diamonds all along the surface when we were tail sun
and i finally figured out it was just little specks of dust on the radiators which you wouldn't even notice normally
but exactly tail sun the sun's rays are coming right down exactly tangent to that surface
and the least little thing on it would flare
and interesting effect which took me a while to figure out what all these bright spots on the radiators are
entry on sts three was done to an about one point zero in the morning landing at white sands new mexico
we started the entry
halfway around the world it is dark and most of the entry was in the dark
the plasma light show that happens as you get down in the atmosphere the ionization that happens produces a spectacular scene out the windshield
i mean it also had us thinking about the missing tiles that are going
but a night entry is really a show
the next flight was a day entry which was not nearly as spectacular
i mentioned about grabbing the stick too late unfair to jack and then the de rotation
now onto part three
how am i doing
i might make it yet
sts fifty one f was a whole different situation than the earlier test flights
one big difference is there were seven people instead of two
with seven we had to add a little bit on the patch to put the extra two names
this is the ninth flight
there are nineteen stars
primary experiments
this was a science flight
it was a space lab but without the laboratory
all equipment in the payload bay full stem to stern with telescopes mostly
and all the telescopes mounted on the pointing system we had were solar telescopes
so we had the sun in the accurate part of the sky
here is orion and leo the backwards question mark
nineteen stars
a lot of symbology here
a short entertaining video
we had seven people including three mission specialists which doctor hoffman was when he was down in houston
and we had two payload specialists guys who were not full time astronauts
they were solar physicists
and they were the experts on the solar telescopes that we had and went along to fly
first try here at main engine ignition ended three seconds after ignition
we felt the spacecraft rock around the noise and then nothing
and we had a pad shutdown because the left engine the automatic system detected a failure a slow acting valve and it shut us off
so we are there wondering if we are on fire and whether we ought to race out and so forth
it was tense for a while but there wasn't a fire just this automatic shutdown
we crawled out
we were told there would be a two week delay so we took the kids to disneyland and had a good time went back home and started the whole training cycle again
and came back two weeks later and got a good start this time
but not after lying on our back on the pads strapped in for five hours because of some software glitches that had to be fixed and computers reloaded and tested
and one of our reports was five hours is the limit
i mean you are lying on your back with your feet up in a pressure suit strapped in
that is more than is reasonable to ask prior to launch
on the way up well i will mention that later
here is the instrument system
this baby was built in germany
it is this gimbal device that held these four solar telescopes and the star trackers
here is a physics experiment
the oms engines are lit and produces one sixteenth of a g
the thrust of the orbital maneuvering engines
if you are trying to sleep that is what happens when the oms engines come on
and you saw the water going across
it is d j vu
we had the same old pdp package on this but with a difference this time
we took it out of the payload bay and brought it up here
that is my right ear you are looking at in profile out the window
it is crowded up there with seven people up on the flight deck all trying to get a view here but we let go of it
and it had a momentum wheel in there to cause it to spin up slowly
and we backed away from it and flew a couple of very challenging loops around it
here is a sequel to the hairbrush
this is not me
it is story musgrave who has the same hairdo as i do
and he is getting spiffed up for the tv show
that is all we did is horse around for seven days
it got extended a day to eight days again
and this landing was back at edwards runway twenty three on august six th when it was one hundred five degrees lots of heat waves
this landing was by far the most forward cg because we still had all that equipment in the payload bay
and we were almost the heaviest orbiter landing so getting the nose down before it fell down crashed and broke the nose gear was one of my primary concerns on this one
more about the actual launch itself
there is the customary view
they put a camera right in close and got this really close up view but it was about five point five minutes after this picture
we had delayed five hours
it is late afternoon so very quickly heading out over the atlantic we were in darkness
and then bang
remember the left engine got us on the pad abort
well the center engine shut down
we were at three gs and all of a sudden we are at two gs or something like that
instant square wave cutoff and acceleration
looking there and confirming the center engine shut down
what happened was there are a number of sensors on the main engines
the particular one that got us was the fuel high pressure turbo pump
a piece of machinery running at seventy five thousand rpm high pressures
the high tech gear that makes the main engine so efficient iisp but really run at the limits of metallurgy and technology
the sensor that senses the output temperature was a series of four platinum wires in the cavity in the output of that turbo pump
they had some tendency for the wires to burn through
when they burn through they showed over temp was the electrical result of a burn through one of these sensors
well we had two burn throughs
and the software said that must mean there are two sensors that say you are too hot
i will shut the motor off
and it did
with no reaction we just kept going straight and smooth but it now put us into what is called an abort
well here is the crew
there are seven of us
i need to practice this more
but anyway it was a two shift operation
we were going to work around the clock so we had a red team and a blue team
and i was the commander so i had a striped shirt
abort to orbit
we had to call from the ground confirm what we knew already which means turning that rotary knob to ato abort to orbit kind of an oxymoron in a way
it is not really an abort
it is pressing on and pushing the button behind it
it loads the software in to do a couple of things lower the insertion target
we had tried to get as high orbit as performance would permit but now we are going lower
engine down costs you total performance
and we also started dumping oms fuel
we had to turn on the oms engines and we ended up dumping four thousand five hundred pounds of oms fuel
a little bit of extra thrust but a significant loss of weight to allow the remaining performance to get us to an acceptable orbit
and interestingly the last sim we did in training in houston before we went to the cape to fly about two days before was an integrated sim where we are tied into all the controllers and everybody is working as a team
and the very last run we had was an ato abort to orbit
and son of a gun that is what we did
we always had trouble starting a watch
and you try to do everything internally on the crew so that if you lose communication with the ground you can complete the emergency properly on your own
on atos before we had to start a stopwatch at the time we started the oms dump
and we had a chart to go in to find out how many minutes of oms dump we needed to do given at what velocity we lost the engine
and story's job was to do the watch
in the excitement of all the other stuff we had to do to get the oms on we would always forget the watch
but this time he got the watch going so we actually did it right
and we knew that when we got to where we burned out all the available fuel which we did
we went to a fuel depletion cutoff that we would be really close to having to do right away another oms burn to get an acceptable orbit
we are right on the boundary as it turned out
we dumped the right amount of oms every last drop of main propellant gone we were just on the boundary of not having to do the first oms burn and we could relax forty five minutes later halfway around the world to do the final circularization
so it worked out good except we were in a lot lower orbit than we had planned
and everything about this space lab flight depended on the orbit so we were into a giant re plan
here is a nice picture of the ips
gordon i also explain the situation of the inhibit switch on and off
i don't know how much you were aware of what was going on there in the cockpit
there is a switch in the cockpit
you have a lot of parameters that are monitored in the software on the main engines which if they go out of tolerance will shut the engine off
in fact that is exactly why we lost the center engine
but right after that engine shutdown we were in a state where we really don't want to lose another engine
because if with only one left we did not have the performance to get to orbit we would have had to have gone to zaragoza spain and land in the middle of the night where it was a ten thousand foot overcast and raining
i mean if we pulled that off we would have deserved some kind of metal
and so as a preplanned procedure when you lose one engine before the point where you can stagger into orbit on one remaining engine you inhibit the limits
you throw a switch that says you're telling the engines to keep running regardless of over temps or anything because you take the chance which is a big one if something let go to not be susceptible that got us for the first engine that is a sensor failure
and so we did that
we inhibited the limits until we got to a point in the energy profile where we were press to meco that is the call
press to meco means that you are now at a velocity where you can make it into acceptable low orbit on one engine if you should lose another one
press to meco then the plan was we will re enable the limits so we are not hanging it out on a possible second engine failure
and we would accept a second engine failure because we knew we could make it on one engine
so we did that the call came up we went to enable
and then before we got there we got another call from the ground that said go back to inhibit
well it wasn't time to get a full explanation
we dutifully did it
what they saw on the ground is more failures on the right engine
remember the left got us on the pad abort
the center engine shut down on the way up
and to make everything equal the right engine the same sensors they can see on the ground
it is not visible in the cockpit each of those four platinum wires they saw starting to go
clearly a design problem here
and they could tell those were going to go and get us that second engine so that is why we went back to inhibit for the rest of the way
it made a good war story but we got there
we started operating the ips
a platform built in germany with all the telescopes
these are start trackers to align where it is
and this baby could point
the spec was one arch second of accuracy
an arch second is the size of a dime
if you are standing at the capital and looking at dime at the lincoln memorial that is how much
but when we cranked it up it didn't work worth a hoot
they just couldn't get it to stabilize or point where it was supposed to
and for three days the payload specialists and the mss were in constant communication with the ground
and they patched the software in a major way and kept sending up new software loads to get this thing to work
and viola on the third day they finally got it right then it worked well and got a lot of good solar science
just an aside when you are looking at pictures from space you tend to think you walk around out here and the atmosphere is this big ocean of air above you right
lots of air way up there
this little bitty blue line right there barely perceptible there always appears on any sunlit picture showing the limb of the earth that is the same blue as the scattering that causes the sky to be blue
and that is how thick it is
it is just this little thin shell of atmosphere around
at eighteen thousand feet three miles up you have lost half the atmospheric pressure
and that is laying on an eight thousand mile diameter globe
and so that is where all of human history has happened in that little shell over there laying around the globe
a philosophical point for you engineers
what is flying on orbit like
well it is one of the two hundred fifteen pounds of checklist
here i am checking propellant usage against what we've got and where we are because we dumped four thousand five hundred pounds of crucial fuel that we needed to make the planned most maneuvers that ever been done in the orbit on our mission
we didn't want an extra blip out of an rcs thruster and it worked very well
we got through seven days and even had enough to have another day of science on the eighth day
flying is mostly watching the clock
everything happens according to time
and since you have sixteen sunrises and sunsets every twenty four hours you never know what time it is without looking at a watch
and you are looking at a crew activity plan with everything laid out
and we even had an alarm system you could set in the crt to make a tone to wake you up
it is a lot of clock watching to pull off a complex mission like this
it is just the way life is on orbit
now here is one of our really serious high level scientific objectives
this was the official name the carbonated beverage test
i don't know if it was an mit guy or not
he was a real serious academic type
an indian i think
anyway he built a coke can that had a lot of pressure regulators in there and laminar flow annular things
so many that this coke can only held four ounces of coke
but he talked to the white house
reagan was president
and somebody on the staff approved we are going to fly these coke cans and see if they had a system to provide pop in orbit with the regular kind of carbonation and dispense ok
we got the briefing and we had the four stowed in a locker
and i got them out at the start of the test
but thirty days before launch all of a sudden this big thing came down
pepsi got wind of this experiment and went to the white house staff and they got pepsi put on
pepsi went into a crash program to fly more cans of pepsi
here is carl trying the pepsi
you notice that looks a lot like a shaving cream can
well that's how the pepsi came out just like shaving cream this frothy ball of stuff
i mean theirs was the last minute deal
it didn't have any pressure regulators in it
it just went out there
now we worried about having to make a judgment which tasted better
well the problem was we didn't have any kind of refrigerator so they are both warm
warm pop is not my favorite
and so they were not anything anybody fought over either kind
if you let the pepsi float around it would coalesce a little co two in random fashion but the physics of it carl found by blowing very carefully on the edge you could get it spinning up
and spinning pepsi would have the froth at the poles and the liquid around the equator
and we always had a tall guy standing by in case it drifted into something
this is the end of the experiment here
he got it into his mouth without touching any of it
we had the same pdp but as i mentioned and as you saw in the movie we let go of it
we actually maneuvered all around the orbit and looked at the wake through the plasma let go of it
the proximity ops were very extensive and challenging and many many maneuvers
that is in the caribbean
the tongue of the ocean
a spectacular coral reef around very deep water
here is the gibraltar
the rock i believe is out on the point
the mediterranean here and the atlantic here
you've heard you cannot see borders in space
not true
this is israel this way and egypt this way and the gaza strip along here which has been in the news as of late
and in the same area the dead sea the sea of galilee
here is most of israel in one picture
a little closer to home
this is most of new jersey
long island
there is manhattan
hudson river and east river
there are about ten thousand copies of this picture
this is southern california
this is san diego right here
los angeles
and in high rise print you can see water here which is san francisco bay
and the center of it all is the antelope valley right here where i live and where edwards is right here
this is the san andreas fault right through here
closer up of la which at the end of fifty one f we came right by catalina island right up the harbor freeway into edwards
and we went by harbor freeway at about mach three
and closer up of the dry lake at edwards
and the landing
flight test results most of which i have mentioned already
and to finish up i have reports on a memory stick here the pilot reports we wrote as crews which you can take at your leisure
if you are interested copy it off
they are available
not great works of art but the specific things that we learned on doing the flight test
and these are just thoughts of transitioning into operation from test mode which i got to see the whole gamut from beginning to full operational
i apologize for running over
i don't think anybody minded
as you see everybody is listening very intently
thank you very much for taking the time
the formal part of the class will start about five past nine but i'll just start with some introductory remarks
first of all i have got bios from a large number of people
i haven't done a count yet to see from whom i haven't gotten them but if you haven't sent me a short bio please do
it just helps us to get to know who you are
let's see
second thing
the next deliverable which is i think in a week or so i don't have the syllabus with me right now we would like a preliminary indication from you
i am leaving it up to you to form your own teams
roughly we've found about four people make up a good team
that is a good way to spread the work around
if any of you are having difficulty or whatever let me know we will try to help but you are almost all graduate students
you can organize yourself
with a preliminary indication of what system you would like to do a study on
take a handout
i am just wondering if you can provide a list of email addresses to everyone so that we can contact each other
i will be happy to do that
i will post that
let's see
the second thing
there are a fair number of listeners in the class and quite a few of you have contacted me to make sure that it is ok to be here as listeners
i have no problem with that
the only thing that i would ask right now we are more or less filled to capacity
i expect that the class isn't going to grow after this so i think we are ok
what i did tell people is that if we get into a seat crunch obviously the people who are taking the course for credit have priorities for seats
so any of you who are listeners please keep that in mind
next thing
i am going to be putting some things on reserve in the library
this is courtesy of professor cohen
this is the proceedings of a space shuttle technical conference
aaron do you want to say something just about the background
the background is that we decided after the shuttle had flown a couple of times that we would have a typical naca going back to naca but this was nasa technical conference where we actually had technical papers written by the various people that designed the system some you will hear talk some you won't
but these are technical papers of how the systems were developed
so it is a pretty detailed understanding of the thermal protection system the main propulsion system so forth and so on
so it is a pretty good documentary of how it was done
this should be a good reference for your papers
it is one thousand nine hundred eighty three
like i say i will go down this afternoon and put this on reserve in the library
i will also put on reserve a copy of a systems study that was done at texas a and m for a similar course that professor taught on systems engineering and the space shuttle just to give you kind of an idea of what someone else did
this was a rather good paper
i see you gave them a very high mark so presumably that means it is a good example
finally you have all got a copy of this paper by professor cohen and milt silvera who was also a very responsible person in the shuttle program
it is a high level background on the shuttle and its systems
i am sure there are some of you here who are space enthusiasts and who probably have followed the shuttle system pretty closely and to whom there won't be a whole lot new here
but on the other hand we want everybody in the course to come up to a certain level of knowledge about the shuttle its systems and the systems engineering that went behind it
so i think it's good to have something like this available
it's a nice reference piece
today and thursday professor cohen is going to give an introduction into the shuttle its systems and the system engineering that went into it
before we start that are there any other questions either about the technicalities of the course or just anything
oh i know one thing
i have a few comments from people telling me that the pdf files that i posted on the website some people could read them and some people could not read them
i have macs but have been posting pdf files for numerous courses
i have never had any problem with people reading it before
first of all who has tried to look at the files
ok
of those people who have tried to look at the files who has had difficulty
this is strange
well if anybody has any ideas about what the problem might be i would be very curious
i mean have you ever had this problem with other courses
i will do a couple of experiments and post one or two more documents both in pdf and in either word or powerpoint form
i would suggest that everybody during the next two days go and try to open them
let's see if we can isolate where the problem might be
like i said i've never had this problem with any other courses
and in principle i mean the whole point of pdf files is it's supposed to be compatible across macs pcs and all that
so i don't know what the problem is but we'll see if we can run it down
and thanks to those of you who let me know that there was a difficulty
that is all i have
any other questions comments
what are you kind of expecting with these journal deliverables so we can kind of be just ahead of that
the idea is to basically put together the highlights of the lecture from the systems engineering point of view
in other words what we want when somebody is talking about a specific system we want you to have a brief description of the system the purpose what it does something about the design considerations something about the operations kind of the basic concerns from the systems engineering point of view
and anything they talk about particular interactions between that system and other systems
can you think of anything else in particular
i think that about it
ok
i will think that through a little bit more and maybe i can come up with a checklist that would help you put that together
it's not meant to be a big burden
it's just a way to organize everybody's thinking on how to get the most out of the lecturers particularly because as i mentioned these lectures are all being given by and large by different people
they will have different styles
we have kind of explained to everybody the structure of the course what we're looking for but i cannot really guarantee in advance what the content of the lecture will be
professor cohen and i will make any attempt if the lectures don't cover some of those critical points from a systems engineering point of view we will try to stimulate the discussion on that or fill in
but you should do the same thing
in other words make sure that there is something that you think you would like to be getting out of the lecture and you haven't gotten don't be embarrassed to ask questions
something you ought to think about when these individual lectures come up is it should be the description and function of the system
if they don't bring that out then we ought to try to bring it out
the requirements of the subsystem or the system what are the requirements
because that is very fundamental
what are the requirements
the development of the subsystem
what kind of problems did they have
what kind of technologies did they have to overcome
and of course the operation of the subsystems
those are i think key points
now whether you're going to get that from everybody or not i don't know
but i think you need to look for that
and if you don't then we will try to develop that
are you looking for the notes to be taken in class
i don't follow you
i mean i am not looking for a xerox of what you're writing in the notebook if that's what you mean
no
i mean i would like you to put your thoughts together into a concise form
and i think that will be a good reference to you hopefully after the course on shuttle systems
ok
over to you
you are going to have a very unique opportunity
you are going to have people speak lecture you on the various shuttle subsystems in quite a bit of detail
you will have some people that will be very very positive about the shuttle that think it's a great design a great operation
you will have others that will not think it's so good
and you will have some that will give you just a detailed technical approach of what happened
what i would like to suggest to you i think for your good and for the good of the future future students future designers is that you ought to come up with your own decision
was it the right design
was it the correct design
should it have been done differently
and if so why and how would you do it
and i think it will be good for when you go to work on future projects
and it would also be good i think for nasa something we could turn over to nasa
i think it's a very valuable thing to do
so i would suggest you do that as you go through the course
and i will be very happy to talk to you about any of your ideas that you have through the internet through emails or in person discussion
and you might want to do this later on as the semester develops
a little bit what i am going to say today really starts off where dale myers your previous speaker left off
and it gets into a little bit more detail
so as this course develops you're going to get more and more detail
but let me start off again just very much like dale did and talk about the shuttle history
in one thousand nine hundred fifty two the fully reusable launch vehicles concept was discussed
people were interested in that one thousand nine hundred sixty two fully reusable vehicles were seriously considered
the air force study project dynosaur was cancelled in one thousand nine hundred sixty nine
in one thousand nine hundred sixty nine nasa adopted the idea of a fully reusable spaceship
i became the orbiter project manager for nasa in august of one thousand nine hundred seventy two
and at that time i also was manager of the systems engineering organization for the first two years
so i you might say the total system at that time and the orbiter in one thousand nine hundred seventy two
yes
could you tell us a little bit about your background
yes
well my background was i graduated from texas a and m university in one thousand nine hundred fifty two and went to the army went to korea
and then when i came back went to work for rca
and i worked on the microwave tubes the microwave oven
in fact when i told my wife what i was working on i said i'm working on a microwave oven
that was in one thousand nine hundred fifty four
that was a long time ago
how many people have microwave ovens today
everybody does
well in one thousand nine hundred fifty four one thousand nine hundred fifty five when they came out they were about dollars three point zero a piece
i was working on one and told my wife
and we'd been married a long time
i told my wife that i was working on something called a microwave oven
and you are going to be able to cook a roast in a couple of minutes and a potato in a couple of minutes
and she looked at me and said that will never sell
anyway that's what i worked on
then i worked for general dynamics on the atlas and centaur
and then in one thousand nine hundred sixty two i went to the johnson space center and worked very closely on the apollo program worked very closely with the mit instrumentation lab now the draper lab on the guidance and navigation control system
i became head of system engineering in apollo
then manager of the command and service module in apollo
then in august one thousand nine hundred seventy two i became the manager of the space shuttle orbiter
then i became director of research and engineering at johnson space center
and then i became director of the johnson space center
and then for a while i was the acting deputy administrator in washington
and then i retired and went to texas a and m to teach
then jeff asked me to come to do this and i am very happy to be here
actually one thing you mentioned reminded me of something not to divert the lecture today but the fact that there was specifically a systems engineering group at the center which was separate from the project offices is something which is probably worth talking about at some point
that's right
well let me just make a mention of that
when we were in apollo we sat around the table for many days and months trying to figure out how you define systems engineering
we didn't even know what systems engineering was
in fact today i'm not sure you'll get a clear definition of what it is
i want to give you some examples
as we go through the lecture i am going to give you some examples of what i think it is and how it was used
so we will do that
let me say just one other thing
professor cohen has these view graphs in electronic form down in texas and when he gets back he will send them to me and i will post them on the website
well i will give you this whole package because there are also some pictures
i don't know what you want to do with the photos
something that is very key in any design and something you really need to pursue whenever you do a design project is understand the requirements
because if you don't understand the requirements you might get a very good product that is useless
so you have to understand what your customer wants the top level requirements
one thing that was handed down to us is it was supposed to be fully reusable
that was one requirement fourteen day turnaround time
you were supposed to be able to turn the shuttle around in fourteen days
deploy and retrieve payloads
you had to deploy a payload and you had to retrieve a payload
design development and test is estimated to be dollars five point one billion in one thousand nine hundred seventy one dollars
dale myers didn't tell you the whole story but one reason dale myers and i are such good friends is he was associate administrator of manned space flight i was the orbiter project manager and they they being headquarters headquarters was always there to help actually took away two years of inflation
if they had given those two years of inflation we would have met the dollars five point one billion in one thousand nine hundred seventy one dollars
and dale fought for that but lost
now here is where we missed it
the original cost per flight for sixty five thousand pounds was dollars ten point five million per flight in one thousand nine hundred seventy one dollars but for a flight rate of sixty flights per year
when i told my wife i was doing that and she's been around the space program a long time she said you never agreed to that did you
sixty flights per year is pretty hard to do but that's what we came up with at the time
now dale mentioned the air force requirements but here were the phase a studies
the phase a studies were conducted to determine the basic requirements and their effects on design in one thousand nine hundred sixty nine
the principle issues were the size and weight of the payload the cross range of the orbiter and what kind of heat material was going to be used
you have to recognize are we going to use heat resistant structure or reusable insulating material
you have to recognize that our background was mercury gemini and apollo and they all used an ablative material
ablative material cannot be reused because basically the surface changes
you had to have some kind of insulated material so the surface did not change
let me now go through very quickly for you just for the sake of completeness dale showed you a few of the studies
i want to flash up a lot of phase a studies just to let you take a look at what people were doing
and you don't have to read the words but you might just look at the diagram
there was general dynamic's phase a study
there was north american rockwell
that is the one dale was talking about because that was where he was
and there was a phase b study for mcdonnell douglas
so that is what they all looked like at the time
now i am going to go through some just for the sake of completeness here
there was again another mcdonnell douglas study martin marietta
so those were basically some of the studies
you can see they all had some kind of a wing type vehicle
already most of those were delta wings so the decision had already been made
interestingly enough and i am going to quote some names to you and you might go back and research it
max faget was like the lead engineer
he was sort of a man that was immortalized in terms of the space program
he felt we ought to go with the straight wing
he felt very strongly about a straight wing but that eliminated the very large cost range the air force needed
straight wing was easier to build not as high loads on it and so forth
here interestingly enough if you look at chrysler
chrysler had a study
and chrysler actually had a capsule but here were more vehicles
and people were really thinking about this time of a fly back booster where you actually had a booster that returned and came back and landed
and they also had a land vehicle that landed
so that was what the real requirement was at the time
somebody sort of commented about chrysler
there was also ford
there were a lot of aerospace companies back in those days
it has changed a lot that's right
and here is mcdonnell douglas of course grumman
so a lot of these studies
then you're getting to see something already starting to look a little bit like the shuttle
and i am almost through
and here are more
these are i think getting maybe in the phase b studies
but you can see some of them are starting to look like the existing shuttle
lockheed
now the principle issues in the shuttle studies now we're starting to get a little bit more technical and a little more detailed is should the reaction control system now the reaction control system is basically a propulsion system that controls the vehicle about its center of gravity
it's for alttitude control basically
should the reaction control system be liquid oxygen liquid hydrogen or should you use a hypergolic system where you know it is a storable type system
that was a big issue
does everybody here know what hypergolic fuel is
let's talk about it a little bit
well hypergolic fuel is a fuel like hydrazine
it actually has an oxidizer and a propellant in the same fuel
now another issue was a fly by wire flight control system
that was a big issue
do we have a fly by wire flight control system
and now everything has a fly by wire
all the military jets have fly by wire
but basically was it going to be a computer controlled system or are we going to have cables fly the machine
that was a very big issue at the time
wind tunnel tests to determine wing size and configuration
that is a very difficult thing to do
this is starting to get into what you might say is systems engineering
air breathing engines were considered for fly back and later determined to be too heavy
and some shuttle studies that still had to be done was the entry techniques landing speed what type of landing speed were we going to have and the approach pattern
so these were all some things that had to be understood during the studies
the phase b studies were performed in the mid one thousand nine hundred seventy s to determine the preliminary design
the results showed a fully recoverable orbiter
disposable fuel tank
parachute recoverable solid rocket boosters
high performance hydrogen oxygen engines placed in the orbiter to recover
this was all systems engineering that lead up to the design
so you have systems engineering in various phases of the program
and usually systems engineering composes of an interdisciplinary team that has been given some assumptions some constraints
they have some top level requirements
they do an iterative process with some tools such as computer tools for calculation of loads and flight mechanics
and they come up with an iteration of what the design is going to be
so that is basically how it was done
now some of that was sort of like the ground rules
some of the things that came out of it once we started putting the total system together we showed that the fully reusable with a fly back booster was greater than dollars five point one billion
so that was thrown out
now there is a question and that's what i asked dale should we have said hey we need to money to really have a fly back booster
but they gave us a constraint of dollars five point one billion in one thousand nine hundred seventy one dollars and it didn't make it
i showed you many configurations were studies
and the turnaround time of fourteen days dictated a landing with a winged vehicle on a runway
you weren't going to be able to land this in the water or with parachutes
you wouldn't have to land it on a runway so you could quickly turn it around in fourteen days
the payload deployment and retrieval requirement determined the location of the orbiter and the launch configuration
if you look at that large payload bay it would be very difficult to put that on top of the vehicle
one of the requirements that nasa has now is the cev should be on top of the stack
well if you're going to have that large a vehicle it is pretty hard to put it on top of the stack particularly with wings
this is what we had to come up
these are some of the results
and these are all systems studies
this is systems engineering
now you're getting to look at what the design is starting to look like
this is the agency commitment in march of one thousand nine hundred seventy two
in may of one thousand nine hundred seventy two you had the north american proposal
and then i became orbiter project manager in august of one thousand nine hundred seventy two
we did a study
and prr is the preliminary requirements review
but that was the configuration
we made some changes
and the production commitment was made in may of one thousand nine hundred seventy three
this chart which was sort of the gee whiz chart at one point in time showed the one thousand nine hundred seventy one dollars cost per flight for the thor the atlas the titan three c the saturn one b and the shuttle
and that is payload to orbit
so you can see that the thing that was really missed in the shuttle was the dollars ten point five million cost per flight
yes sir
what is the notch on top of the second two that disappeared
that up there
that was their data probe
it was taken off because it wasn't needed
good question
thank you
and by the way do not hesitate to interrupt me and ask me questions any time
and if you don't understand what i'm saying please stop me tell me slow down or ask me any questions you would like to ask me
there are data probes on the shuttle
major configuration decisions
and by the way you don't see them on the shuttle because they are inside the thermal protection system
and they are only sort of turned outwards to take data when you get down to about mach three and you're through the heating
otherwise they would burn off
in the approach and landing test they were out front
when we separated from the seven hundred forty seven i am going to tell you that story in a minute
here are some of the major decisions
we were going to go with a hydrogen oxygen main engine
that is one of the system problems you have to decide
once you decide what kind of engine you are going to use that basically sizes the tankage
and i will show you that on another chart
as i said this size the liquid oxygen hydrogen tanks are not reusable and i will make that point to you a little later on but once you decide what kind of engine you are going to use that size of the tank because of using the equations of motion you can figure out how much propellants you need you get the density of the propellant and now you know what size tank you are going to use
yes sir
a couple slides back you had said the main engines of the orbiter had to be recovered
right
it was a separate contract but it was placed inside the orbiter
when the orbiter came back the engines came back with it
was that your question
yes
for example the johnson space center was responsible for the orbiter
and you're going to have the person talk that was responsible for the engine j_r thompson
he was at the marshall space flight center
but the engines were installed in the orbiter so the orbiter brought them back
solid rocket boosters provided the additional propulsion required to get the orbiter in orbit and the solid rocket boosters were designed to be recoverable and reused
those were some of the system studies that led to the configuration
yes sir
at that period was there any discussion of the environmental impact of solids being used at sixty flights a year
yes there was
there was quite a bit
i don't recall the details but i do know there was a lot of work on that many solids being used
and i guess we basically put that to rest but there was a lot
i don't know the details of it
in fact that might be a good question
if you are not here we will ask j_r
thompson because j_r should know that
i met with some of the russians who worked on the buran which was the russian comparable to the shuttle
one of the big changes was that they said how could the americans have used solids for that many flights
it was studied and actually put to bed or put to rest should i say
i don't know the details but that is a very good question
there are going to be various speakers as i said and j_r should have that answer
solid rockets recovered and reused
well some of the things i have said before the orbiter entry cross range required delta wings
to go one thousand one hundred nautical miles cross range you needed delta wings
deletion of the air breathing engines for moving the orbiter required the boeing seven hundred forty seven to carry the orbiter
let me tell you that story
all of you are very familiar now that when we land at edwards air force space we put the orbiter on top of the seven hundred forty seven and we fly it back to kennedy
well i was the orbiter project manager i became orbiter project manager august of one thousand nine hundred seventy two and i was having all sorts of problems
the first thing they did to me was cut my budget in half
the omb cut my budget in half
that was the first thing that happened
and then i just had a lot of problems
but i had worked on the apollo program
i had a lot of friends in the organization although i was orbiter project manager
three of my friends came into the office one afternoon i forget maybe two or three months after we started and said aaron we have a great idea
i said what's that
they said we can put the orbiter on top of a seven hundred forty seven or a dc ten and ferry it back to kennedy from edwards air force base
we may have to make one or two stops and ferry it back
i look at him for a moment and said that is absolutely the dumbest idea i heard in my life and i basically threw the people out of my office
and these were my friends
well these people will not take no for answer
it happened to be they had another very good quality
they were all world class model airplane builders
and these guys had won competition all over the world three of them
so they came back about ten days later
and i don't know how many of you have seen the johnson space center but we have a lot of acreage out there in texas
they said come out we want to show you something
they had built a radio controlled model of the seven hundred forty seven and an orbiter and actually flew it for me and separated the orbiter from the seven hundred forty seven
that is how it got started
and so we eliminated the air breathing engines
but i remember throwing them out of the office
fly by wire with a digital autopilot
yes sir
are you saying that you had air breathing engines and the orbiter itself would fly back to edwards air force base
that's a good question
i missed that point
let me explain it to you
that is exactly right
if you recall when the orbiter lands the nose gear is very short
what we had to do he asked a very pertinent question we had to actually replace the landing gear with a different landing gear that caused the orbiter to have an attitude like this
it wasn't like this
it was like this
we put air breathing engines on and took off and had to have five in flight refuelings to get to california
strap on air breathing engines
and plus a different landing gear
and we took off horizontally
and five in flight refuelings to get from california to florida
and you brought up an important point that i left out that's the reason why we changed it
thank you very much
and of course we went with the fly by wire with a digital autopilot
this was a very fundamental change
the astronauts at that time did not like this very much
now when you get all these new pilots in they wouldn't know what you were talking about
why not have a fly by wire system
they didn't like it at one time but we went with a fly by wire with a digital autopilot
even though you are going to have a special briefing on the guidance navigation control system i am going to talk a little bit more in detail about that because that happens to be my expertise
so i am going to talk about that a little bit in more detail
yes sir
what does fly by wire mean
it means that you actually have a computer which actually controls the surfaces
whereas in past airplanes your stick actually had cables that controlled the surfaces
so you get a lot more performance
it is a little bit confusing in the sense of a wire
don't think of it as a hard wire which is like the old type of airplanes where there was a cable
when you pulled on the stick there was actually a cable that went back to the ailerons and the rudder and everything
and as professor cohen says everything now has a computer in the middle
and what you're really doing is flying the computer
and the computer then issues the commands to the hydraulic system
but the shuttle i guess was the first vehicle that really had that system
there were no commercial planes flying with that system or military planes flying
and the real concern was safety and reliability
suppose you have a computer problem what are you going to do
i will talk about that in detail
that's a good question
any other questions
those are very good questions
i appreciate them
yes sir
can you just explain cross range for a moment
cross range
realize the orbiter is a glider so to speak
not much of a glider but a glider
and actually downrange would be going in this direction
cross range would be out of plane direction so you could actually maneuver out of plane
we have a nice globe here
i am not going to carry it up to the front and i don't have a piece of chalk either
these are very good questions by the way
thank you very much
here is the united state roughly
this was designed for the military requirements
they wanted to be able to for reconnaissance satellites basically you want to be in polar orbit because you are going around let's say this is an orbit here then the earth turns underneath it and so you basically fly over all parts of the earth
that was the basic military requirement
they wanted to be able to launch out of vandenberg on the west coast into a polar orbit
and because of security reasons this sounds a little bit strange when we think back on it but in a time of crisis remember we were in the cold war and everything you wanted to be able to put a satellite up without necessarily giving the other side a chance to make all the radar measurements on the shuttle and everything and figure out right away where the satellite is
and also there might be hostilities
the shuttle was a strategic asset
so basically they wanted the shuttle to be able to land the very next orbit
well all right you take off from california you fly over the pole and you deploy your satellite
and by the way we have never with all the satellites we have deployed ever deployed a satellite on the first orbit
that would be an incredible feat but that was the requirement
so you fly over the pole you come back around
now you're ready to land in california
but during that time the earth has turned by a thousand miles twenty four thousand mile circumference in twenty four hours
actually one thousand five hundred miles because an orbit is ninety minutes one point five hours
your orbit now would put you right over the pacific ocean
if you just burn your engines slow down and come down through the atmosphere that is where you are going to land
so instead as you're flying through the atmosphere you basically have to come down banked on your side
so essentially you're generating a lift vector
and instead of turning your lift vector up you turn your lift vector to the side and that pushes you over
and delta wings can generate a higher lift vector than the straight wings and that was the determining factor
very good
well i think that's right
can you address that jeff
my recollection at the time was that even coming in over the pacific yes there were some places where you could land on land but it would mean landing in hostile territory the soviet union or eastern europe and we didn't want to do that
so the cross range initially was to be able to make australia
well i'm sure that's right
certainly there were landing sites that we had all over the world
it could have been a much smaller cross range if we were willing
and i will say continue to remind us if we don't explain some basic things
because we've been dealing with this for so long that some of these things just seem like second nature
you weren't even born when the shuttle started flying
and so the level of backgrounds is going to be very different
we want to bring everybody along with us
so if there is something that we say the same thing you know the question about hypergolic fuel if we use a term and you don't understand it we will try not to use a lot of acronyms
i cannot guaranty that the speakers won't use acronyms
don't be embarrassed to just stop and say what does that mean what are you talking about
but as we go through the course you are going to get more detail more detail
for example you have a total lecture by a man named henry pole who is going to talk about the reaction control system
he will give you all the details you want to know about hypergolics and storables more than you ever wanted to know
so you are going to get more details as you go through
but don't hesitate to ask questions because it's good for us
let me tell you another satellite story
my wife and i moved to college station
my wife was working at a junior college in the registrar's office
she was working with a young lady and apollo thirteen came out
well apollo thirteen happened to be my first mission when i was manager of command and service module so i know a little bit about it
in fact i am going to give a lecture in dick batten's course on the twenty six th on apollo thirteen
but my wife talked to this young lady and said i went to see apollo thirteen yesterday
and she said it was so exciting
i didn't know how it was going to end
so it is a frame of reference
well we've talked about this
the size of the payload bay is sixty feet long by fifteen feet diameter
size of the crew cabin defined to be over two thousand six hundred cubic feet
the payload as you know is sixty five thousand pounds at liftoff thirty five pounds at landing
and what you need to understand is the orbiter is a launch vehicle it's a spacecraft and it's an aircraft
and when you look at the two different systems i worked on apollo as i said very much and on the shuttle and there is no question that the shuttle is much more complicated than apollo
on the other hand the apollo mission is much more complicated than the shuttle mission
but this is something that makes it very very interesting
this is a very old chart
and in fact this is the original chart
it comes out yellow
this was the original cost estimate and how they totaled up the dollars five point fifteen billion
we talked about that
and that was the very original cost estimate done on a cost analyst chart
there were no personal computers at the time
in fact i found that in my files
that's a very old yellow chart
it's hard to believe some of those numbers
on the other hand i had a gentleman who worked for me who got his phd at the university of colorado and his subject was the cost of the shuttle orbiter
and it turns out that if we had those two years of inflation we really would have made that cost on the dollars five point fifteen in one thousand nine hundred seventy one dollars
it only ran over by about ten percents
that's right
let's now talk a little bit about configuration
i don't know if you can see this chart or not
now you might say how did you go from that conception in august of one thousand nine hundred seventy two to something with all these numbers on it
now this is really a case in systems engineering
and let me explain to you what i mean by that
certain assumptions had been made
one assumption was that in the orbiter it was going to weigh about one hundred seventy five thousand pounds without payload and you were going to have a sixty five thousand pound payload
you had to make that assumption
you also had to make an assumption that you were going to use a liquid oxygen liquid hydrogen engine
and why did you select that
today i'm not quite sure it was a good decision but we did
why
because of specific impulse the isp or the performance of the engine was the highest for the liquid oxygen liquid hydrogen chemical compulsion that we know today
so we selected that
well when you use the equations of motion you integrate the equations of motion or any other techniques you may want to use you then show how much propellant you're going to need to get that into orbit
then you know that liquid hydrogen has a density of about four pounds per cubic foot very low density
that means this big external tank is mostly hydrogen
it's a very very big volume
and liquid oxygen is about seventy pounds per cubic foot
that basically sizes your external tank
it's a very simplified approach but that systems engineering
you get much iteration because there is an old adage that the devil is in the details
so you keep iterating on that with this expert team
you then say well that's still not going to be the most efficient way to get you to orbit
you say you need really a stage system so you put the solid rocket boosters on
you don't have what they call a single stage to orbit you really have more like a two staged orbit and you size the solid rocket boosters and determine when they have to come off
basically that is how you go about doing the systems approach using systems engineering to come up with a configuration
now that is a very over simplified way of doing it the statement i made but that's basically how you do it
and these are some of the dimensions that then come out of the vehicle
and i think they're in that handout we gave you also
and it looks like i am going to take off
i did know that this chart tries to lift off on me
i don't know what the best way to do it is
you can find those dimensions i believe in that paper that was handed out
but this shows you all the dimensions of the space shuttle system the solid rocket boosters the external tank and the orbiter
now an interesting sideline in this which i got to thinking about after the columbia accident where the foam came off
of course the reason why we put foam on was because with liquid oxygen liquid hydrogen at those temperatures you are going to have a lot of ice form
and when ice forms and comes down and hits the orbiter with the thermal protection system
i am going to talk about that in more detail you are going to do some damage
so one solution would be to put foam on the tank to eliminate the ice
and of course you would assume that foam could stay on the tank
another solution would have been to not go with the liquid oxygen liquid hydrogen engine and go with what we call storables
of course they wouldn't have gotten as much performance and you probably couldn't put sixty five thousand pounds of payload into orbit
but the point of bringing this to you those are some of the decisions as you go into various projects you need to challenge the requirements because the requirements are really going to decide what kind of system you are going to have
that's really the point i wanted to make
are there any questions
yes
that's a good question
one thought at one time was to put the liquid hydrogen tank in the orbiter and that would basically isolate it
you'd put it inside
or put insulation on the inside as you pointed out
those were thought about
the decision obviously was not to do it
i don't recall the reason why
but when j_r
thomas comes i will ask him that question
that is a very good question
yes it was two things
could you put some of this propellant inside the tank
and the other is could you put insulation inside the tank itself
and that was looked at
and i guess it was complicated and very costly to do it that way but it was looked at
that's a very good question
by the way these are very good questions
one thing when you look at this external tank only the very upper part is for oxygen because the density of hydrogen is so low
i mean all of this part of the tank is for hydrogen
so to have put all the hydrogen inside the orbiter you would have a very different looking orbiter
you wouldn't have been able to do it
but she really said could you put insulation inside the tank
any other questions
but that's basically how the system evolved
now i oversimplified it to quite an extent but you have to realize there were a lot of iterations
one other key thing though when you have new systems engineering you do it in a team
you usually have different capabilities on the team arrows mechanical engineers electrical engineers so you have different types of disciplines on the systems engineering team that can help you do that
and then you have a systems engineer that sort of heads it up
but we're going to concentrate more on the orbiter
and we have one of the speakers who is going to concentrate on the engine and so forth
that's what the system looked like
the other thing that is interesting i think is what the mission profile essentially looked like
and this happens to be for sts five but this is the basic mission profile
now before i start that let me say this gentleman right here has flown that profile five times
and so he's done that five times
he can talk much more about it than i can
one time i will tell the story i'm just about tired of hearing it but when i was director of the johnson space center we had a lot of visitors
one time i had mister james baker who at that time was secretary of the state and eduard shevardnadze from russia who had the same position in russia at the time
and i took them over to mission control as a visit and put mister shevardnadze down in the flight controller seat and was going to let him talk to the crew
not knowing that jeff hoffman was on duty at the time edward shevardnadze spoke in russian up to the crew
and before the interpreter could answer it down comes this beautiful answer in russian from jeff hoffman
so that really floored both mister baker and edward shevardnadze and me
that was an interesting story
here gives you a little profile of the shuttle mission
you lift off
you've reached max dynamic pressure in about one minute
about three thousand eight hundred feet is where you reach dynamic pressure
you have the srb sep in about two minutes
you remember in the challenger action i believe it happened at about sixty seconds
but in two minutes you get srb sep
and it lands the srb by parachutes
you have meco which is main engine cutoff
the main engine cuts off
and that to me is the biggest issue
when that main engine has to burn for over eight minutes that is taking all the propellant out of that big tank the liquid oxygen liquid hydrogen firing the main engines
what's the velocity of the main engine cutoff do you know
it's within a few hundred feet per second of
and then you get external tank separation
the external tank comes down about nine thousand miles downrange and lands in the indian ocean
then you use the orbital maneuvering system the oms engine the pods on the back of the orbiter
you use that for a very short period of time to get into orbit
then you have your operations whatever you're going to do go out and service the hubble or whatever
you de orbit with the orbital maneuvering system engine
you have entry interface at four hundred thousand feet
and why do you pick four hundred thousand feet
because that's where you start sensing gravity
you get about zero point five gs at four hundred thousand feet
and then you reenter and land either at edwards or kennedy
yes
why does it turn
yes
you mean liftoff
yes
well that's a very good question
let's see if i can repeat that very accurately
the fact is that we used the apollo launch pad and the ditches for the flame bucket where the engine goes
so in order to get it to the right alttitude we had to make that maneuver
you had to make that roll maneuver during liftoff
is that what you're talking about the roll maneuver during liftoff
yes
we had to make that roll maneuver because we weren't in the right orientation
we had to make the roll maneuver because it wasn't oriented correctly on the pad
now let me answer your question
the buron was a russian vehicle
well dan brandenstein who was an astronaut headed the astronaut office saw that the russians made this roll maneuver
and he asked the russians why they made that roll maneuver
i mean they didn't have to do it he said because you do
that's true
did you hear that story
did i say it correctly
i think so
he said because you do
that is a good question
there may be one other aspect to it and that's the question of why does the shuttle actually fly upside down on the way up
and i believe the original decision was aerodynamics because the thrust is asymmetric
you have the external tank and the shuttle is sitting on the external tank so the thrust actually has to be through the center of mass of the whole system
so it is actually flying not straight but is a little bit screwed
and for aerodynamic purposes i guess they figured there was less stress
although recently they've started partway through the launch doing another roll maneuver
and i think that's for communications
i'm not one hundred percents sure when they started doing that again
i'm not sure either
but the early part of the launch when you're riding the solids aerodynamically you go through max q you're in much better shape if you're upside down
yes
well to use a big solid rocket booster it's not very efficient
many people have studied single stage to orbits
let me just ask a question
i know we've got a mixture of aero astro and tpp esd
are there people here who have not seen the rocket equation
everybody
well ok
that's very important
let me just very briefly if you have a rocket and you want to increase the velocity of the rocket i mean that's a critical thing by a certain delta v you can take the mass of the rocket when you start the burn which we call m sub i the initial mass and the final mass
and of course the initial mass equals the final mass plus the mass of the propellant
and that equals an exponential to the negative power of the velocity decrement which you're trying to put in divided by the exhaust velocity of the propellant that's coming out
now this is usually phrased in terms of what we call the specific impulse times gravity because it's done by engineers
that's right
so you will hear reference to the specific impulse and the units of that are seconds
but if you multiply that by the gravitational acceleration it will actually give you the exhaust velocity
because this is in an exponential it is extremely sensitive to the exhaust velocity
whatever delta v you are trying to get out if you can add a few more seconds to the specific impulse then the actual mass of propellant that you have to burn in order to create that delta v goes down substantially
now for hydrogen oxygen the specific impulse is about four hundred fifty seconds
for solid rocket motors the specific impulse is on the order of about two hundred fifty something like that
that's what i thought it was about two hundred fifty
that's almost a factor of two
and you put that into an exponent if you try to get into orbit with purely a solid rocket motor you need a lot more propellant
and that means the payload mass you can take into orbit is reduced
that's why in addition to using hydrogen and oxygen and we will have a lecture specifically on the main engine they got every last ounce of performance out of it by running it
you'll hear references to running it at one hundred four percents abraded thrust one hundred nine percents abraded thrust
and all of these have engineering consequences because in order to increase the exhaust velocity which of course if you do that that's in the denominator so that's going in the right direction you have to increase the chamber pressure the temperature and all of the design problems
he is going to ask you the question why don't you use liquids all the way
i knew what your question was
he is asking why don't you use the liquid hydrogen engine all the way rather than using solid rocket boosters
well first of all why not just have a bigger fuel tank one big fuel tank and just use the shuttle engine
that's what he's saying
that would be essentially single stage to orbit
and i'm not going to spend a lot of time with the rocket equation but the delta v that you need to get into orbit is well orbital velocity is just under eight kilometers per second
but to that you have to add the gravity loss
and so the overall delta v is effectively about nine kilometers per second
if you put that into the equation you actually can get the ratio of the final to the initial masses
and even for a hydrogen oxygen engine you can basically almost ninety five percents of the mass sitting on the launch pad has to be propellant
which means that all of your structure can only be about five percents
now if we could make super strong super light structures like an eggshell then in principle we could get to orbit without staging
now the first thing you learn in rockets one hundred one is why you cannot do single stage to orbit
it is because right now we do not have the technology to do that
well see many people have studied single stage to orbit
in fact nasa tried to build one the x twenty three and we failed
what they say is really what you need is to be as smart or as high tech as an eggshell
be able to make the structure as thin as an eggshell hold all the fluid in it and have very low density
some day maybe we will do it
basically by using the boosters or in a more traditional rocket a first stage once you've exhausted the fuel then you drop all of that structural mass
and so for the second stage this initial mass becomes much lower
the other thing that's interesting is that if you go back to apollo during apollo there were three ways to go to the moon
one was direct
von braun wanted to build a large vehicle called the nova where you actually lifted off from the cape and sent the whole vehicle right to the moon
the other was to do earth orbital rendezvous
and the other way was to do lunar orbital rendezvous like we did
it turns out that that nova vehicle had to be so big that that was ruled out so we wound up with earth orbital rendezvous
yes sir
how much did the role of geography play in the design considerations
because just looking at that i mean you have to have the external tank separate at a specific talking about launching in vandenberg
originally we thought about launching out of new mexico
actually when you're doing flight design depending on whether you're going into a due east launch to go into a twenty eight degree orbit or a high inclination orbit the placement of the external tank reentry is a major factor in flight design
we spent a lot of time on that
and in fact often the trajectory has to be shaped to be not quite efficient as it otherwise might be because you have to control the landing of the external tank
but your question is a good one
i did some consulting for a company after i retired and we were looking at a commercial launch vehicle
and we were trying to launch the vehicle out of various places in the united states
and it's very difficult to get approval because of the concerns they had for types of failures or anything that you're going to do
yes sir
i'm not sure why i thought this but i was under the impression that the external tank burned up in the atmosphere
no
it didn't hit down
it breaks up in the atmosphere
it didn't come down as one big glob
some of it burns up but some of it does get back to the ground
ok
is there any talk about a need to clean up all that
well they haven't yet
i'm not an astronaut
that's mainly aluminum
remember the liquid hydrogen liquid oxygen inside evaporate and are non toxic
they question that doctor young asked about the solid rocket booster environmental problem is a real problem that had to be solved
the other problem i had i worked on trying to get the galileo cleared because it had a radio thermal nuclear generator on it
to get that cleared going into orbit is a big job
i worked on that and thought i would never finish it but we finally got it cleared
but it was a very tough job
we had rtgs cleared to be launched
i don't remember specifically all the noxious chemicals that come out of the solid rocket boosters but it is pretty nasty stuff
yeah it is
i remember one of my launched the families and guests are taken to a launch site viewing area about three miles inland from the launch pad
and it just so happened that the wind was blowing onshore that day it was an afternoon launch and my brother is a real space nut who always liked to watch as the rocket went
after about seven and a half minutes it just sort of disappears over the horizon
but after about five minutes the solid rocket exhaust was actually approaching the spectator area because of the wind blowing in
and they made everyone get on the buses and drove them away so that nobody got injured
and my brother was really annoyed because he didn't want to leave
if we have time i would like to talk to you a little bit about the challenger accident talk to you about the o ring seal
i would like to talk to you about that
i don't want to sweep those things under the rug but i would like to talk to you about that because i've got my own thoughts on the problem that i would like you to hear
ok
any other questions on the mission profile
shall we keep going
yeah
tell you what
let's take a two minute break stand up and turn around
an hour is a long enough time to sit for a bit
i am assuming that everybody is aware that the russians at one time had a space shuttle program
and they manufactured a vehicle which looked almost identical
not exactly but almost identical
and it was no accident because they used our plans
they used our thermal protection system too
and they only ended up flying it once
and they actually flew it unmanned
and despite a little bit of nail biting during the landing they did recover it successfully
and then they discovered just what we had discovered that it was a lot more expensive to operate than they had anticipated
and they had a lot less money than we did
and so it basically never flew again
they had crews of cosmonauts who had been training to fly the buran but there were actually two differences
the first was that they put the engines on the external tank
this did two things
first of all it did improve the performance
and also the russians were turning out engines on assembly lines basically
they turn out a tremendous amount of rocket engines
and i guess from their point of view and i don't know the details of the performance of their engine how their main engine is compared to ours i think they actually had four engines if i remember
the orbiter was just a glider and it was no difference
it was an unpowered glider
they did learn one thing from us that when you have a delta wing vehicle you are very very sensitive to the center of mass of the system
and it was a problem because the orbiter when it flies back through the atmosphere it hits the top of the atmosphere at mach twenty five and then flies all the way down to subsonic
and the control characteristics and stability characteristics change throughout that flight envelope
and we will have a lecture specifically on the aerodynamics of the shuttle but it turns out that the shuttle is extremely sensitive to the forward cg
and i think it was around the mach three flight regime if you're just an inch or two forward of the critical area in the cg you can lose control
and so we actually on many flights they always do a weight and balance on the shuttle before a launch have had to be put lead ballast in the aft engine compartment of the shuttle just to get the cg far enough back to get mach three stability
i hate to tell you how many tons of lead we've launched into orbit over the course of the shuttle program because of the cg
and if you look the delta wing profile of buran is slight different from the orbiter because i guess they learned the lesson
and so they were not as sensitive to the cg
but of course once you build an orbiter you cannot really change it
and so we were sort of stuck with it
to add on one of the other concerns was having the orbiter with the thrust behind the orbiter and this large mass in the tank you could get a pogo type activity
and so one concept that max faget had early in the program was to have a swing engine
actually have the engines fire on the back of the tank and then when you get ready to separate the tanks swing the engines back into the orbiter and bring them back into the orbiter
and we threw that out
that was a little complicated
you're going to have a discussion on mechanism in mechanical systems
and mechanisms in mechanical systems everybody can design but everybody has a hard time making them work
when you put up an electrical schematic everybody accepts it
when you put up a mechanical drawing of a mechanical system everybody has an idea of how it is supposed to work
let's move on
i've got some pictures now just to show you
it is showing a profile
and then of course you've seen the vehicle when it gets to roll out of the assembly building
there it is stacked
and then it's on a crawler
this crawler basically was used for apollo and the crawler takes the vehicle out the pad
just one thing so that people notice the difference here
is anyone familiar enough with apollo to be able to say what the fundamental difference is with the crawler mechanism here and the crawler in the pad
well if you look at the picture of a saturn rocket being rolled on the crawler the whole launch tower was on the crawler
and so they rolled the whole thing out
with the shuttle it's a little different
i will be bringing in some pictures at some point to show you some of these details but they actually cut off the top part of the saturn launch tower because the shuttle stack isn't quite as tall
and they added a movable what's called a payload change out fixture
and so once the shuttle actually gets on the pad there are actually railroad tracks here
is this a better picture of it
ok
yeah
this whole enclosure rolls over and forms a kind of hermetic seal around the shuttle so that you can open the cargo bay doors which by the way cannot support their own weight in one g
so you have to put an external strong back on them
and in the meantime you put the payload that is going to be installed this payload canister here that is installed in the change out room
and then it is swung over the doors are open the payload is installed in the bay
and then this forms a protective enclosure over the shuttle
and it is not swung back usually until the day before launch
see now this is again another detail in systems engineering
you go in for that schematic or that little plan form of the orbiter and you did iterations of the size and then you had to do iterations of the launch complex how it was going to put payloads in
and that's all systems engineering certain levels of systems engineering
i mean it's very easy to say well we will just put the payload in on the pad
but the actual development of the mechanisms to do that is extremely complicated to say nothing of which i mean what kind of amazes me is that it has to be done essentially in a clean room environment
you're up there crawling around the pad inside the payload change out room in white coats bunny suits and gloves on
and outside the wind is blowing and it could be raining
there is sand blowing by
so the whole thing has to be done in a clean room environment but it's on the scale of a naval shipyard
this is a huge vehicle
so it's really a challenge
of course that's one of the reasons in all honesty why the cost per flight has gone up
the original concept when dale myers was associate administrator of manned space flight the man who spoke to you i went up to him seeing i was the orbiter project manager
and we concluded this will be very simple
we were going to make very standard payloads
you went put the payload in fixed it in we were going to launch it deploy it come back fail the computer on the pad we'd go anyway wouldn't replace the computer
of course that all changed
the missions became very complicated and we didn't do that
that is another important point though
you better be sure when you get to be a project manager or manager you understand your requirements understand your customer's need
but if the ground rules change your performance is going to change
so you need to understand that
any other point you want to make jeff
any other questions
i've just got some other pictures
here is the liftoff as you see everything burning
have we had a case where we hit a bird on launch
yes i believe we have
of course in the orbiter windows one of the things we did i hate to say this is fired dead chickens into the window to see if you could break the window in the system
i think we did an aircraft also
and we actually did i remember one simulation where in the simulator right at liftoff
the instructor came in and threw a rubber bird in the commander's lap and said you've just been incapacitated by a bird strike
and so the copilot had to take over flying
you should realize that kennedy space center is actually a wildlife sanctuary and so there are a lot of birds
there's a national wildlife sanctuary park rangers and a lot of eagles
there are eagles and a lot of turkey buzzards
there is a landing strip that is right in the middle of the bird sanctuary
and so often before the shuttle gets ready to come in they will send planes to sort of buzz the runway to scare the birds away
they also had a problem at one point with owls
no woodpeckers excuse me
woodpeckers were decided that the external tank insulation was a good place to find bugs
it sounds funny but think of what that actually potentially could mean
they had to go down and had loudspeakers and stuffed owls and everything which they ended up putting around to scare away the woodpeckers
these are things again which i think the original systems engineering never took into account
we were worried about f equals ma
and there is a typical deployment of if i'm not mistaken to get the payload into orbit
here is a picture of the crew at their station with their crts
and of course then you de orbit
and this is of course not a real picture
do i have that right
this is right
and then of course landing on the runway
that's a typical profile that we've gone through in terms of showing
now let me talk a little bit more about systems engineering
when i took over in august of one thousand nine hundred seventy two we had what we called space shuttle orbiter management reviews
that's north american
this was one of september one thousand nine hundred seventy two
and i think it might be interesting to look at the agenda in september of one thousand nine hundred seventy two what we were talking about
and here was the agenda
i'm not going to go through all the paperwork but here was the agenda
basic resizing of the vehicle because of certain problems we had in the iteration
cabin configuration and docking location
the space shuttle main engine interface control document
it turns out interface control documents are probably one of the most systems integration tool because interface control document defines how you're going to put the main engine into the orbiter
what is interface
an interface could be this plug
if you had a plug in a socket it would be bad if you couldn't plug that in
but that's an interface
when you change your tire if those bolt hole patterns don't match you'd be very frustrated
so that's an interface
interfaces can be as simple as that or they can be very very complicated
and so this was the ssme interface control document how we actually get the main engine in terms of mechanical propulsion put into the orbiter
integrated asset control abort requirements
and now we're talking about just procurement rcs and oms procurement
the rocket motor's procurement package
avionics definition leading edge tps and emergency risk
these were some of the problems we started talking about
now these are lower level systems engineering problems
but they are systems engineering to make the definition of the total launch configuration
here is an interesting chart
this is dollars
why this is interesting is you see on this chart rockwell's proposal
these are dollars one million
one hundred twenty three million the first year but when i became orbiter project manager that was rockwell's proposal
the first thing they did to me they told me i only had dollars seventy three million that year so i had to re phase the whole program
i had to rephrase the whole program to fit the funding curve that the office of management budget gave me
this was a major perturbation
when you do that and you don't get your money as the proposal it comes out to be a cost increase
right away we went a little bit cost increase to four point six but as you don't get the funding requirements you then essentially lose your momentum you lose your schedule
and once you lose schedule you start costing
as doctor hoffman mentioned you have the three ledged stool cost schedule and performance
and that is a continual tradeoff as you go through a systems engineering program
and the things you have to look at the things that cause project managers to lose their job is first you're going to recognize that you have a weight increase in the vehicle
whatever you build is going to cause to have your weight increase
the next thing you're going to have is a schedule slip
and then when you put those together you're going to have a cost increase
and then you're going to have technical problems
and those are disastrous cases for a project manager
those are reasons to firing somebody
luckily i made it
i made it because of a man that you are going to hear talk chris kraft because he was my immediate boss and he ran interference for me
and you're going to hear doctor kraft talk
he's a good man to have on your side running interference for you
you're going to hear him talk
he's a great guy
and he's going to tell you what he thinks
and he'll tell you what he thinks
but that's a little bit about cost
further systems engineering questions in the orbiter management review is orbiter maximum wing size
atp is our authority to proceed
wing size is very important
you've got to get the aerodynamic model wing load squared away
we said no major line change after program requirement is reviewed
controlled dry weight was one hundred seventy thousand pounds including margin
and i don't think we made that did we
no we didn't
more like two hundred point zero
no ejection seats on vertical flights
top located docking port
wing area for landing speeds of one hundred fifty knots
wing stiffness criteria
flutter margins
control effectiveness for entry and ferry
elevon design concepts
crew cabin
these were some of the systems engineering problems that had to be resolved before you could start manufacturing
one of the interesting things i forgot who was head of the astronaut office at the time
i don't know if it was brandon stein
i don't know who it was
at which time
well at about the time of the design of the shuttle
about this time
i forgot who i asked but we were trying to get the cockpit laid out
it was very important to get the cockpit laid out
and i wanted the crew to have their inputs on how they wanted the cockpit
you want the crew to be a part of laying out the cockpit
i called the head of the astronaut office over and said we need to lay out this cockpit and you need to come back to me with a decision of how you want the cockpit
he said i cannot do it
i've got one hundred astronauts over there and they won't agree
i said i'll tell you what you do
you tell them that i will give two weeks and then i'm going to do it
and that really scared them because i didn't know anything about laying out a cockpit
and we had the cockpit laid out
so that's sometimes how you have to use management techniques
now we're going to get more into the details of what you're going to hear in some detail
and i'm going to start if off a little bit
here are basically the hardware subsystems
you're going to hear a technical briefing on the thermal protection system and the structures
you will see in your syllabus when that is but you're going to hear a very detailed discussion of the thermal protection system the structures by tom moser who actually did the work
he was actually what i call my subsystem manager on the shuttle in the early days of the program
you are going to hear a technical briefing on the space shuttle main engines and a very detailed briefly by j_r
thompson
j_r
thompson a little background about him he was project manager of the main engine at marshall space flight center
then he became director of the marshall space flight center
then he was deputy administrator at nasa
now he is vice president of orbital sciences
you are going to have a detailed briefing on the hydraulic system the auxiliary power system fuel cells orbital maneuvering system and the reaction control systems
that is going to be by henry pohl
guidance navigation and control is going to be by phil hattis from the draper laboratories
environment control and life support of the crew cabin that is going to be a man who is currently working at the johnson space center walt guy who actually did this job for the apollo
most of these people by the way did the same thing for the apollo that they did for shuttle
very similar jobs so you can ask these people about the apollo program
landing and mechanical systems by al louviere
communications and electrical power we're really not going to brief although we will talk electrical power when we talk fuel cells but we're not going to really have a discussion on communications and fuel cells
and then we're going to have some analytical studies on aerodynamics and aerothermodynamics
these will probably be detailed technical discussions when we get into aerodynamics and aerothermodynamics
again these people did the same on apollo as they did on shuttle
that is going to be your details of what you're going to see
what i'd like to do now with the few minutes we have remaining is talk to you a little bit and give you a little bit of flavor of some of these subsystems a little bit more detail than that we've previously given you but not as much detail as you're going to see
let's start off a little bit with the orbiter and just show you what the orbiter looks like
and talk a little bit about some of the subsystems in the orbiter
the forward reaction control systems is up in the far nose of the vehicle
and then you have the reaction control system back in what is called the oms pod orbital maneuvering system pod
you have reaction control systems here and here
that's reaction control systems
you have your orbiter maneuvering system back in these oms pods
of course you have the main landing gear and the nose landing gear
the wing faring and the leading edge which is the carbon material
this wing edge is carbon material
and the side hatch
and the overhead windows
and then the side windows and the far windows
the payload bay doors are made out of graphite epoxy
they were originally made out of aluminum
we made it out of graphite epoxy because of the weight growth
we could say quite a bit of weight if we went from aluminum to graphite epoxy
that was the largest probably at that time composite material used in an airplane
it was made out of graphite epoxy
and then the main engines of course are in the aft end of the orbiter
and then you have the vertical tail stabilizer
and of course you've got your elevons
and you've got the body flap
the body flap was actually put on originally to deflect some of the heat from the engine but it actually turned out to be a control surface also
it actually turned out to be both the focus of a control surface
that's sort of the layout
and you can visualize where you use these systems these active systems
the reaction control system is used primarily in orbit getting ready to de orbit
the oms is used to help you get into orbit and get out of orbit or maneuvering you want to do
the body flaps and the elevons are actually used primarily during entry a little big during assent during entry
we do use the rcs system a little bit during entry
in the high altitude of entry you use the rcs system but eventually during entry the load just becomes so high the rcs system or reaction control system does not become very effective
i guess that's about all i want to say
any questions on that
yes sir
i was wondering why the nose gear was so short
well it actually saves weight making it shorter
it was easier to put in and it saved weight
and i think also when you land by having the nose down you actually have an aerodynamic force pushing the orbiter down on the runway which increases your stability
and since you don't have to worry about eventually taking off
like professor cohen said if they had wanted the shuttle to be able to take off horizontally from the runway they would have had to raise the nose
yes sir
well when you say under designed i mean i would call it a minimum design
i mean if it were under designed it would break
i mean there are landing limits
as i said for a planned nominal landing and you have to realize there are different kinds there are emergency limits and limits for nominal operations you can take off with sixty five thousand pounds
that means if you have a launch abort and you have to return and land with your payload you will be landing with sixty five thousand pounds
but you don't plan to do that
that's a one off deal
if you're planning to do it it means you can do it over and over again and then the limit is thirty five thousand pounds
they don't build it like a navy carrier landing airplane i will tell you that
not just landing gear i found the tires are just really small
the tires are small
they have no treads either
and the brakes were small
actually the original brakes were under designed and we kept having brake failures
in fact i took the drag shoots off and then we put them back on
i took them off because of weight and put them back on
tires are very interesting
we're going to have a very detailed discussion on tires but tires are very very complicated
you think by putting more plies on the tires you make it stronger but not necessarily because when you cycle them they got hot and the more plies tend to hold the heat in and weakens the tire
tires are not a very simple thing to design
they are only used once then
no
i think we used these tires i think five times or could use them up to five times
the brakes are used five times
i don't know about the tires
i don't know
let me talk about weight and margin
let me go back to apollo
we had apollo designed
and we found that on the lunar module taking off from the lunar surface it was too heavy
we couldn't lift off
the engines were already built the tanks were already sized and we couldn't get off the lunar surface
and that's not a very good deal
the astronauts didn't like that too well
george low was the program manager at the time
we were spending in those year dollars dollars twenty four point zero a pound to get weight out of the lunar module
and they scraped they did everything they could to get any
you're basically offering them dollars twenty four point zero for every pound that they could scrub out because we couldn't resize the engine
the engine was there
they were literally in there with emery cloth shaving down the aluminum from the inside
so weight can be very critical
i don't think most people realize how close the margins were there
i mean the lunar module was only certified for i think five pressurizations
and then it was beyond its structure limits
my statement to many people is the next time we go to the moon we are going to find out how hard it really was because to tell you the truth we went to the moon with one computer in the service module and one computer in the lunar module
excuse me
we did have two computers in the lunar module
we had the mit computer and then we had a strap down system built by trw
that's an interesting point
i think somebody asked the question last time
let me talk about the aft end of the orbiter a little bit because we did not have cad cam systems at the time
and let me show you some pictures taken
i don't know what vehicle it is but that's the aft end of the orbiter
that's where the big engines go into
this looks like it is going to take off
if you crawled in the back of the aft end of the orbiter there is plumbing there is wiring there is structure
now had we had computer aided design at that time i am convinced we would have a much neater better design than we have today
we had to mark everything up
we marked it up and we changed it
people bumped their heads on it
if you go to the aft end of the orbiter you'd wonder how they can do anything but that was done because we did not have computer aided design
like airplanes now have virtual markups
you can actually build a virtual markup right on your computer
we didn't have any of that
and this again is just to show you what the crew module looks like in a structural point of view
that was the pressure vessel
that's basically a pressure vessel going together
and there were the windows
but the thing that's interesting about that it had very intricate welding techniques
and these techniques were very good and actually proved to be a very very satisfactory design in a pressure vessel
i would like to now talk a little bit about a couple of subsystems that you're going to hear much more detail about
but now venture into some systems and tell you a little bit about them
it's probably going to be the thermal protection system and the guidance and navigation system
i will talk to you a little bit about that
here is an old chart that shows now unfortunately i use english units maximum heat rate and btus per foot second squared integrated heat load and radiative equilibrium temperature
and then you see the apollo return as number four
and the apollo design was about one hundred btus per foot squared integrated heat load if i read the chart right and a heat flux of about three hundred btus per foot squared second with a radiative equilibrium temperature of about a little over five thousand degrees fahrenheit
on apollo that was our baseline
we used an ablative head shield
now the ablative heat shield has a density of about one hundred thirty to one hundred forty pounds per cubic foot and is not reusable
on the shuttle it was about forty thousand btus per foot squared integrated heat load and fifty btus per foot squared second for heat flux with a radiative equilibrium temperature of about three thousand degrees fahrenheit
now at that point of time we had to come down from our baseline knowledge of an ablative material to what we could use and make it reusable and light
and there were several competitors at the time
one was a metal insulation rene forty one i believe shingle type material very thin very high temperature and it had pretty low density
and then of course there was the ceramic material or the so called tiles which was basically a ceramic material
it is made out of silica
in fact interesting enough it's made out of what we call gopher sand that comes from minnesota
why is it gopher sand
i'm not quite sure but it's got a very high pure silica content
and you make it into a mulch and then you actually bake it and it comes out in these tiles
and of course tiles sometimes are hard to bond to the vehicle
how many people knew the tiles were hard to stay on the vehicle
well i was the orbiter project manager and my home town is san antonio texas
we would go back to san antonio to visit my family
my little old aunts would say their nephew is in charge of the shuttle program and he was having trouble making the tiles stay on the vehicle
they couldn't understand that because they had tiles in their kitchen and their bathroom and had no trouble at all having those tiles stay
so they couldn't understand why i was having so much trouble having the tiles stay on the vehicle
we had a problem
what would we use
there were two competitions on it
one was the competition from two of the research centers
the langley research center wanted to go with the metallic version and the ames research center wanted to go with the ceramic version
and at jsc we're trying to figure out which one to go with and we decided to go with the ceramic version
of course tom moser is going to give us some detail because tom was the guy really in charge of it
but just to give you a little background and he'll go into more details of it the problem we had with the tiles is that when you bonded the tiles of course they were basically a ceramic material
forget about this layer called densified for a moment
when you bonded the tiles to the room temperature vulcanizing material which is basically a high temperature glue to the strained isolator pad you got stress risers set up and the tile became very weak
it broke really at the bond line of the tile because it became very weak
the stress risers were such that because it was ceramic it broke at the interface
we had one very cleaver engineer that saved my day because tiles were falling off and i couldn't get the vehicle built
he said if we densified below a quarter of an inch of the tiles and tiles could be anywhere from two inches to four inches thick and by that i mean put liquid glass inside that tile the bottom became like really a hard surface no stress riser you could bond it like this and basically have the inherent strength of the tile
it no longer broke at the bond line it broke at the tile which had a very high load
so after we did that we really did solve the tile problem to a large extent
that was the day we really solved the tile problem but i remember this so distinctly that we were doing all these tests and all these analyses and all of a sudden they called me one day and said aaron we're just doing a very simple flat wise tension test and tiles were just coming off the vehicle
so that is what saved the day
i think it's another good example of problems in system engineering if you just leave it there for a moment
sure
we worked so hard figuring out how to make these tiles and they are extraordinary
you can take one of these tiles put one side of it into a kiln heat it red hot and you can hold the other side of it in your fingers
i mean that's how good the insulation is
and i guess everybody just sort of figured we know how to glue things on
you brought up another very good point that i left out
the problem is we spent so much time figuring out the efficiency of the tiles to do the thermal protection
in other words this is fantastic tile
it weighs about like balsawood so it is anywhere from ten to twelve pounds per cubic foot compared to one hundred thirty pounds per cubic foot
it can take the higher temperature ablative material and be reused
so it answered all the questions we had about thermal protection
what we didn't do though was figure out how we're going to attach it to the vehicle
but everybody i think just assumed i mean it's almost like your relatives we glue tiles in the bathroom all the time
anybody can glue stuff onto something else
but we really did a bad job
in fact that's an example i use in my course at a and m
we come up with a function structure
what functions does this have to perform
well it doesn't actually have to thermally protect the vehicle
it has got to stay on
and we forgot about the staying on part
we talked about the thermal protection part
and this thing is so good its thermal diffusivity is so good that like professor hoffman says
you could get the surface temperature to two thousand degrees fahrenheit and hold it in the palm of your hand
and so it turned out it was a very very good solution but we almost blew the day by not coming up with this design
why does it have to be individual tiles rather than big long panels
well because of the coefficient expansion
now that's the point of this strain isolation
and it's another interface problem which is part of the system's engineering
the structure of the shuttle is aluminum
thermally it expands and contracts by several inches every time you go from night to day
i mean the orbiter we've done these measurements
one side of the orbiter is pointed towards the sun
the other side is cold
the orbiter actually bananas by a couple of degrees
and they did thermal tests in some of the orbital flight tests where the payload bay
the clearances could change by a couple of inches depending on the thermal conditions and designing mechanisms to latch them closed with those tolerances
so the orbiter is flexible and expands and contracts as a metal
the tiles don't
they are rigid
and so if you have too large a tile area the aluminum is going to bend under it and the tiles will crack
and even with the small tiles between the aluminum and the tile there is this strain isolation pad
this of it as sort of like a felt type material
it kind of eases the interface between the two
and of course if you look at the tile installation on the vehicle in between the tiles remember on the last mission we went eva to fix the gap fillers between each one of those tiles mainly for problems during liftoff to keep the tiles from vibrating and damaging each other
and those gap fillers i'm not concerned about going eva to fix it
well on the other hand once you see the problem you cannot let it go so you've got to do something about it
they went eva and pulled the gap fillers out but those are the tile installations
but your question is a very pertinent one
why are there so many
and that's the reason because of the coefficient expansion
then you put gap fillers in between those tiles to keep it from damaging during liftoff
it does turn out that one of our biggest concerns is going to be how fragile the tiles were
and they really turned out to be a pretty good system
we were concerned about losing a tile and then getting heat and having an unzippering effect where you lose a bunch of tiles
and we really alleviated that problem
i will tell you another funny story
this is probably not so funny but it was a story anyway
i've forgotten what mission it was but these tiles are actually waterproof
we actually put scotchgard on them because the waterproofing is in the tile
and after a certain mission the waterproofing boils out so we had to waterproof the tile
sts four was the hailstorm
that was the first one where they recognized the problem
well anyway rockwell international was my contractor
the head engineer at rockwell was a brilliant guy but he ran a test where he put a densified tile panel in a bucket of this scotchgard or this rain repellant material
and he called me about eleven point zero at night
and i was getting ready to go in because we were
we just ran this test and all the tiles came off
i said what do you want me to do with that information
we're getting ready to back the de orbit burn
i mean they were coming down
i said what do you want me to do
i said that was sort of a dumb test wasn't it
i said is that what happened on the vehicle
did you actually put the tiles in a bucket of water repellent material
he said no
i said that's a dumb test
i took it upon myself after talking to the man you're going to hear tom moser what do we do with it
we didn't tell anybody
now i took a big risk on that
but what could you do about it
there was absolutely nothing you could do about it on that test
so that's an interesting case in discretionary project management
but you will hear more
let me just mention the question of waterproofing because again that was something that i think at first slipped through the systems engineering
and it was the fourth shuttle flight sts four
i was down at the cape for some other activity
the night before a launch they had rolled back the payload change out room the whole shuttle was exposed
well a thunderstorm with hail came through and it pelted the bottom of the shuttle
there were pox marks all over it
and of course it was raining
and people realized that the tiles actually were absorbing material
the outside of the tile is kind of impervious but once you crack that the rain can get in
and they actually brought a tile expert down from the cape and did some calculations
it was an early flight so we didn't have a maximum payload luckily because we ended up carrying they figured probably a few hundred many over a thousand pounds of water into orbit
and there was so much water in the tiles that the orbital dynamicists were able to measure the perturbation of the shuttle's orbit because of all of the water that was evaporating
and of course it was evaporating from the bottom so that it effectively was asymmetrical and had a propulsive force
and after that was when they came up with the idea of scotchgarding
and if you look closely at each of the tiles there's a little hole where every tile before every flight they go through with a hypodermic syringe and just inject a little bit of scotchgard
and think how critical it is
you've got over thirty thousand tiles
if you add one ounce to every tile you do the math that's a lot of extra weight
so you want to put in as little as possible scotchgard but enough to do the job
this might be a very good subject for you to decide to redesign
you might think about what are the technologies what are the differences how would you do it differently because their technology has changed
that's why i brought this one up
and you will hear a much more detailed discussion by tom moser but you might think about this as one of the subsystems to look at
i guess that's all for today
ok
we will see you on thursday
let's get started
again just putting things in perspective professor cohen talked about how in a big engineering design project you work through the various stages
and the first stage is phase a where you come up with the basic concepts
and i think the level of detail of the system and subsystem lectures that he is giving
last lecture and today we could sort of look at as being on kind of the phase a level to show the basic feasibility and the overall structure
those of you from aero astro have certainly been familiar with our approach to systems engineering which we call cdio
someone from aero astro can tell me the c is conceive design implement which actually means manufacture and test and operate
so we're kind of dealing in these first few lectures
and this could be looked at as phase a and then the detailed design that's your phase b
that ends with the critical design review after which in principle you're supposed to be ready to cut hardware
and then you get into the phase cd where you actually build and test
and then of course we operate
my sort of background the way i got into engineering and i probably should have mentioned this at the beginning as sort of truth in advertising is i was never trained as an engineer unlike professor cohen
i was actually trained as an astrophysicist
but when i went to nasa i spent so much time working with all the technical systems and interacting with the engineers and the people who use them that i learned certainly a lot about the way these systems are designed and particularly operated
so my approach to a lot of these engineering situations is very much from an operator's point of view
and i will try to emphasize that as we go along
very important right from the beginning of the design i think that you think about how you're going to operate the system
we have had too many examples that i've come across and many people who have to actually operate systems where you build something without really thinking of how the system is going to be maintained and taken care of
one of the things that we have been doing for the last few years is to take a group of undergraduates down to the kennedy space center every january an interim activities period and have them spend a couple of weeks with the engineers and technicians who have to maintain and operate the shuttle system
and they hear lots of stories from the engineers and particularly from the technicians who say boy i would like to have a chance to talk to the person who designed this little system
and i have to get my hand all the way around
and it takes five hours to turn the bolt or something more fundamental
and we will probably discuss this when we talk about the main engines
the fact that originally the main engines were supposed to be reusable without being taken out of the shuttle so that you could cycle them many times
well it turns out that in order to get sufficient confidence that the engines are ready to fly we really do have to take them out after every flight
and they are extensively borescoped when you look inside
but some of the engineers in the main engine shop pointed out that for instance if certain diagnostic test equipment had been built into the engine so that you could have taken data as the engines were shutting down over and above the data that we actually get possibly we would have been able to reduce considerably the maintenance on those engines
again the shuttle was the first time we had really tried to design reusability into a space vehicle and engines
and we've learned an awful lot
so i think it's very important when we discuss the systems in the course of the term that we don't just look at the detailed design but we also consider the operations
that's very important
in that spirit professor cohen is going to continue his introduction to the shuttle systems
and aaron i will turn it over to you
ok
thank you
as professor hoffman said i'm really giving you what i would call a technical management overview because when we talk about structures on the twenty two nd mister moser is going to come and talk about structures and he's really going to go into the details
how the loads were calculated how the stressors were calculated how nastran was used how we came up with the basic structure
but i'm just going to really give you sort of an overview on it
and i think it's interesting to note that the structures may be a very good system to look at for your project because it weighs a lot
we certainly didn't have all the tools for calculations that you have today to make it a more efficient structure
the materials are a lot different
but basically this structure if you start at the front of it the crew cabin which i showed you a little bit about being made a welded configuration and the forward fuselage are basically an aluminum skin stringer structure very basic aluminum
if you go back down to the mid fuselage which is the large part there it's again a skinned structure
interestingly enough the forward fuselage and the crew cabin where made by rockwell international in downey
the mid fuselage was made by general dynamics in san diego
so we had various people putting the structure parts together
the wings were made by grumman
so we had this vehicle being built all over the country coming to palmdale california for assembly
and the aft thrust structure was built by rockwell
the vertical tail i believe was built by fairchild on long island
some of these places don't exist anymore
but then you go back to the vertical tail
again it is machined skins with honeycomb
the aft fuselage as you can see is very complicated
it has all the plumbing all the wiring all the auxiliary power unit so it is a maze of plumbing and wiring
you could get lost in there and they'd never find you again
but it is a maze of wiring and plumbing
and it's made basically of aluminum
but a lot of the support structure are boron aluminum thrust structure panels with graphite epoxy skin panels
and then the payload bay doors which was our innovative material going into large composites
we use graphite epoxy that was the first time that really a large composite structure was used in a vehicle
now it's used quite commonly in the air force and a lot of places but graphite epoxy were the panels we used
and that saved a lot of weight
one of the problems we had though was when we built these panels we found we got moisture trapped in it
and of course the moisture when you heat it up coming back it would pop the panels off
so on the pad we had to go in and drill little holes in these panels to be sure we could get the moisture to escape
so those are things you learn when you do new technologies
but as i said mister moser is going to go through a very detailed explanation of this
this may be something you want to consider because there could be a real innovative way of reducing the weight and making the vehicle more robust so i suggest you think about that for the structure
now i'm going to talk a little bit about guidance navigation and control
and some people asked me yesterday where they could find some information on it
actually in those orange or yellow books i've forgotten what color they are that we showed you that are on hold in the library have a very detailed analysis and discussion of how the guidance navigation and control system was formulated
and it is probably as good as you're going to find
it was very early in the program
it's a little bit different than it is today but it's a very good description of the redundant computer set the fail operational fail safe system
so i think you could really get a lot out of going through that book
i should just say it turns out that we have two sets of those books in the library and they are on reserve so you can only use them for two hours at a time
there really should not be any problem with everybody in the class having access to those books when you need to go and look at them
that will probably be the best source except when phil hattis from the draper labs comes and talks about the guidance system
i will talk a little bit more about that
this chart or this schematic or whatever you want to call it was originated by the johnson space center and rockwell international
it took us many hours but it basically is the architecture i am going to go through it in some detail for the guidance navigation and control system
now this was the original one
it is a little bit different today and i will explain the differences that we have but this was basically the guidance navigation and control system main architecture
and you can see on the left side and the left side is what i would call sensors
first of all in a very simplistic term some of your experts in guidance navigation and control but guidance navigation and control navigation is actually determining where you are guidance is getting to where you want to go and control is controlling the vehicle and its stability and its characteristics around the center of gravity
so that's basically control
this is for the total guidance navigation and control system
interestingly enough the contractor for this was ibm federal systems division
we used their computer and they did the software
much of the hardware was designed and built by other contractors and rockwell international basically did the integration
and they did the integration on a system called the shuttle avionics integration laboratory
it was basically a vehicle that was in the laboratory that had all the electronics the cockpit and everything in it
it simulated the actuators
the hydraulic system was simulated and the engines were simulated but basically all the hardware and software was in the shuttle avionics integration laboratory
i imagine you spent some time
we actually had two
we had one in houston and there was one out at rockwell
and when professor cohen says that it was a vehicle you have to appreciate that it was actually laid out just like the shuttle so that they had the controllers which were in the aft end like in the engine compartment were a hundred feet away from the crew cabin and the computers and all the lines the data and power lines were laid out as closely as possible to physically duplicate the layout in the shuttle because there was concern about the timing of signals going back and forth
and they wanted to run the simulation as accurately as possible
and then of course you have to have a set of simulation computers to try to determine the environment that the shuttle would be flying in so that it could make the inputs to the rate gyros and the other parts of the measurement units to try to duplicate the flight regime
and here is an explanation of the alphabet soup of all the systems subsystems components
on this side you see really the sensors
that's the information that you need to do your navigation part of it
and then of course that information then is sent to the computer through a multiplexer demultiplexer mdm which basically is an analog to digital converter digital to analog converter
the computer does its computations and then sends it to the effectors which actually change whether it's the rcs reaction control system whether it's the orbital maneuvering system whether it's the aerosurfaces the srb actuators the solid rocket booster actuators the main propulsion system actuators
so you've got sensors computation and effectors
let me talk a little bit about one sensor which probably many of you can relate to and that's the imu or the inertial measurement unit
and draper labs is famous for its inertial measurement units
i worked with draper labs or mit instrumentation lab on apollo and we had the original initial measurement developed by the mit instrumentation lab in that vehicle
the initial measurement unit has gyros on it to determine angles and it has accelerometers on it
and it is aligned with the star tracker
it's basically a stable platform
it's aligned with the star tracker to get a reference system in inertial space
and when you make a maneuver you get acceleration and you send it to the computer
and you integrate it once you get velocity and you integrate it twice and you get position
and it's also used during powered flight and it's used during entry but that then goes to the computer
so the inertial measurement unit is very critical
just to give you an example here you have three of them and you have four computers
i'm going to talk about the computers in a minute
you have three of them
you have to recognize when we went to the moon on apollo we had one imu and one computer in the command and service module and we had one imu and one computer in the lunar module except we did have a backup system called a strap down system
the primary system was built by draper labs mit and the backup system was trw
so we had two different contractors
then you have rate gyros and accelerometer assemblies primarily for ascent for the stability of the bending of the vehicle
here's the air data transducers that we talked about yesterday for entry
then you have the microwave landing system the tactical navigation radar altimeter rendezvous radar
these are all sensors you use during various phases of a mission which again go through the mdms or multiplexer demultiplexers to the computers and then to the effectors which change your position and velocity as need be
let me talk about the computers for a moment
you see four computers
that was the real test of this system
we had four computers that were synchronized
this vehicle as we talked about yesterday for aerodynamicists we decided to make it statically unstable
we saved a lot of weight
by that i mean a regular airplane a normal airplane that's stable
when you get a disturbance it will still come back
without any augmentation it will come back to its original position
with this vehicle if you get a disturbance it will diverge
so you had to continually have augmentation
so you had to have a fail operational fail safe system
and that's why you have four computers
it's fail operationa fail safe you could lose one computer and your fail operational will use another computer
that means you have two left
and you're fail safe and you come home
so that's what it is
now the real concern about it is these computers are synchronized
they essentially communicate with each other four hundred forty times a second
now i'm recalling a lot of this from memory but four hundred forty times a second
and they actually vote on each other to simplistic form terminology
and if one computer is out it votes it out and another computer takes over
basically that's it
but the concern we had was that in doing this we could have a generic failure and lose all computers or we could have what we call a two on two split
and these would be sort of diabolical errors which would cause the vehicle to fail
so we decided after this was made to put in a backup flight system a backup computer a fifth computer
now it turns out there was an argument there
should we have the fifth computer a different computer and different people or should we have a same computer with different people
and we argued long and hard on how to do it
and we had a lot of experience with the draper labs
the draper labs just did an outstanding job
the mit instrumentation lab just did an outstanding job on the apollo vehicle both on the command and service module and lunar module
we went to the mit instrumentation lab draper labs and asked them to actually take the same computer but put it outside the loop
it's not part of the redundant set
it's outside the loop
i didn't show the schematic right because it gets all the same information that the other computers get but it then can take over if the primary system fails
now phil hattis did this work for the draper labs for nasa in this backup system
he's going to give you a lecture
he's very good to lecture on this total system
he can tell you about the total system
we thought we'd put the backup flight system in just for a short period of time to give us confidence in the primary system but it turns out that we started putting things in it that now we needed so we could not take it out
so it's really part of the major system
that is a very different part of the system today
i don't think we ever really had a diabolical problem in flight
i think we did have one in the shuttle avionics integration laboratory one time when we had a two on two split
but when we did the approach and landing test where we had the orbiter on top of the seven hundred forty seven and we separated the orbiter and landed i remember that first flight i was sitting in the control station at edwards air force base and at that time i smoked a pipe and when we separated a big x came across the screen because we lost the first computer
i guess the shock actually broke a solder joint in the computer
the power shock from separating actually broke the first computer so we had to go to the second computer
i bit my pipe in two
but it did prove that the redundant set did work because it took over and landed
we had a very successful in flight test not planned but it turned out to be a very successful in flight test
now when you make the computations you get the information on position that the computer computes it sends it to the effectors
the effectors during the high part of entry may be to the reaction control system the forward rcs system or to the aft or it could be to the oms systems if you're trying to make a maneuver
or when you get down lower in the atmosphere it could be the aerosurface actuators
and then during ascent it's to the solid rocket boosters or the main propulsion system
so those are the effectors
the flight control system is a very interesting system for entry because as you can envision early in the entry you don't have any aerodynamics so your aerosurfaces aren't of any value to you you use the reaction control system
but as you get farther into the atmosphere the loads become so high that the reaction control system becomes ineffective and then you have to use the aerosurfaces
so it's a blended system
and the system has to know when to handle the aerosurfaces versus the reaction control system
and of course then you also have displays to the crew and actually information that the crew could use to make certain decisions
so that basically is the guidance navigation and control system
there is one additional change that i don't have on this chart which they have incorporated the global positioning system in the shuttle
the gps is now part of the system
it took a long time to do it because i remember it wasn't done when i left
and were you still there when it was implemented
yeah they did put it in
and gps you can essentially get position
if you could get attitude then theoretically you could eliminate the inertial measurement
and i don't think they do it that way
but theoretically the gps for you looking at the guidance system change this again becomes a very interesting system to look at
would you do it different today
for example the computer that was used i cannot remember all the characteristics of it but it's basically the ibm four pi computer which is a very old computer
it was probably made before many of you were using computers
or weren't born
which i think was a design from the early seventy s
yeah it is the early seventy s
this would be a very neat system to take a look at for your system
not only that you could probably get a lot of support from draper labs and that type of thing
so it would really be a good system to take a look at
and i'm sure you could make a lot of improvements
those improvements could theoretically be used on the new cev the crew exploration vehicle
i think it would land a lot of merit of you very smart people to take a look at the guidance navigation and control system
yes sir
in the air data transducers were there more than just torpedo tubes and static cords
that's all there was i believe
i think that was
we had a lot of problems with those
i think it's just very old technology
yes
i was going to ask how you got position information before gps
position
well i don't know exactly
but it's got thirteen satellites going around
well there were two ways
i mean the desire for gps of course was to give the shuttle autonomous navigation capability
the shuttle with the star trackers and the imus it has the autonomous ability to determine its attitude but it doesn't know where it is because the inertial measurement units drift over time
and so you need to be able to update the state vectors
originally the only way you could do it was radar tracking from the ground
you would track it
you would get a state vector
you would uplink the state vector and then the shuttle would know where it was
and then periodically you would have to update it because of imu drift
once we got the tracking and data relay satellite system installed you do get navigational information by the doppler navigation and from the signals coming back and forth through tdrss but it was generally calculated on the ground
so it was not really until the advent of gps that we got autonomous capability
you need it for things like if you're going to deploy a satellite for instance you need to know your position pretty accurately
because the satellite is going to take that position and has to do its burn accordingly
and obviously for your reentry burn or for rendezvous it's critical that you know your position
when you're doing a rendezvous the shuttle does have a rendezvous radar
i don't know if we'll deal with that in detail
once you get close enough to the object that you're rendezvousing with such that you can get it either with your radar or they actually use the star trackers to optically track the object then you can start getting your relative position with respect to the object even though you may not know your absolute position
and so from that point of view the shuttle gets a certain degree of autonomy
maybe i'll just say one other thing about the computers because people are amazed at how primitive the shuttle computers are
but like i say the original idea and the concepts that we talked about this was going to be an airplane like vehicle
and originally they wanted to use some off the shelf hardware
and of course the ap one hundred one s as they finally used them were not off the shelf
but these original computers had one hundred twenty eight k of memory
and the memory they used i don't know if any of you have read back in the history of computing where they actually had the little magnetic ring cores with the wires going through
i mean this was really old stuff
and they did finally replace that with a solid state memory with a whopping two hundred fifty six k
and again probably none of you have dealt with overlay technology but back when i was a graduate student and we were using computers to do complex astrophysical calculations sometimes you would have a program that was too big for the computer memory so you would have the whole program on a tape recorder and you'd segment it into what they would call overlays
and then you would load it one part at a time and it would do its calculations
and then you would stop and load the next batch of software
well that's the way we have to run a mission
the computers cannot hold enough software to do ascent orbit and entry
there are three segments of flight software
you start the mission with the ascent software loaded
then when you get up into orbit you do what they call a major mode transition where you basically punch a button and everything goes blank
and you sort of sit there saying i hope this is going to load properly
and the tape recorder chugs away
and then it loads the orbit part
and the same thing when you're getting ready for entry
now the backup system they decided that they didn't want to take that risk
that if something went wrong in a major way they wanted the whole flight software on the backup system
and that meant it had to be scrubbed
the backup system is capable of flying the shuttle and getting it home safely but there are a lot of capabilities which the main computer system can do which the backup system cannot do just because they're limited to the amount of software
the one other thing i'll say is putting together this redundant set of four computers because as professor cohen said the shuttle will not fly without the computers
i mean it's absolutely flight critical
hundreds of times a second every computer is looking at the data from all the other computers
and they are all voting
and so you have this matrix just to make sure you understand the way the system works
if computer number one sees a problem with computer number three it's likely that computer three is also going to see a problem with computer one because they're doing something different
but if computer number two sees a problem with computer three and computer three sees a problem with computer two and computer four sees a problem with computer three now you've got a three to one vote
and so computer three will recognize that it is the problem and it will take itself out of the set
and that's what happened well in that case the computer actually shut down
i remember that big x
i bit my pipe in two
and at the same time all of this information has to go back and forth to the backup computer
because if you're ever going to engage the backup computer it has to be ready to go at a split second's notice
and there are situations where you can get a two on two split
when we run through the simulations to learn how to work this actually learning the ins and outs of how to work the computer system is probably one of the biggest trainings
the astronauts become more knowledgeable than the designers
yes
if there is this danger of a two to two vote was it ever thought about to have five computers then
well that's why we put the backup system in
oh the backup system
yeah the backup system
that was why we put the backup system in
it did a little bit more too
it was programmed by different people
even though it used the same computer it was actually programmed and formulated by different people
so that was one way of saying take away any you might say systematic errors that were in the redundant set
in other words they kept the same software requirements document but the actual coding was done by draper rather than by ibm
that was the other problem
suppose all four computers are doing the same thing but there was an error in the code which never turned out so that something starts to diverge what's your protection against that
there was a big argument in doing that
the real argument said should you really have this or a different computer
should you really just say just do everything differently
just have a different computer
a different everything
and of course there are advantages to that and there are disadvantages to that
so we settled on this
i think there was another question
was there a question back there
yes
you said this was the first fly by wire system
i was wondering what competing ideas there were besides having
well fly by wire means when you put an input into the control system whether you do it manually or whether the computer does it nevertheless ultimately your command just goes into the computer
you put the stick to the left saying i want to do a left bank all you're doing is telling the computer you want to do a left bank
and now the computer has to figure out what's my navigation state where am i if i'm coming down through the atmosphere what's my altitude what's the air pressure what's my mach number
and then it's programmed with aerodynamic control laws
this is one of the big challenges
because as i mentioned the other day you hit the top of the atmosphere at mach twenty five you do your initial control with the rcs
as the dynamic pressure starts to increase first the ailerons the roll becomes active at about i think ten pounds per square inch something like that
you blend the roll control into your aerosurfaces
at about twenty i think it's pounds per square inch you can do the pitch control
but because the shuttle is coming in at a forty degree angle the vertical stabilizer is pretty much shadowed
so for yaw control you actually have to keep using the rcs all the way down to about mach one when the shuttle finally pitches down and the vertical stabilizer now has some effectivity
the computer calculates all this information and it comes to the effectors and you do the control laws on that
and the problem is that the flight control laws which the computer has to use in order to control the air surfaces in the rcs are not constant on your way down
i mean the flight control laws at mach fifteen are very different from at mach five
and there is part of the flight regime for instance where if you want do a left bank you actually have to start by commanding a right yaw
and then the cross coupling terms in the aerodynamics actually causes you to go in the other direction
it gets very complex
and the flight control system is continually changing as the entry progresses
and so the idea that maybe you should have a direct backup link between the pilot's inputs and the aerocontrol surfaces although it might give you a warm fuzzy feeling you could not fly the shuttle directly
because to be able to take into account these change in control laws on the way down you just cannot do it
in fact the shuttle is uniquely i mean unless the shuttle knows where it is if the navigation state goes bad the shuttle cannot fly
you could have the runway in sight but if the shuttle's inertial nav state is wrong you will lose control and you cannot land
so it's a very complex system from that point of view
this is a very very if you can envision the systems engineering that went into this system it takes aeordynamics it takes flight dynamics it takes electrical signals it takes guidance laws navigation laws hardware software
this is probably the biggest integration job or systems engineering job
it requires everything
it also has to take into consideration aerodynamic heating
i'm going to show you that in a minute because you've got to be sure that you don't fly outside the regime that you were designed for aerodynamically
i think you had a question
just real quick how big are those imus
because nowadays you can get a solid state one not quite that big
well i don't recall
it's a box sort of like a shoebox
the apollo imu was about this big
that was built for the polaris vehicle
it was one imu and it was a three gimble platform
and i remember it was a big issue
a three gimble platform has a singularity so you had to maneuver the apollo vehicle a certain way so you didn't get the singularity in it
and one of our astronauts jim mcdivitt quite a famous astronaut who was a good friend of mine said he wanted a fourth gimble
and there was no way we could get an imu in that day in time with a fourth gimble
so what i did was gave him a fourth gimble to carry with him on his flight
a little gimble system so he had a fourth gimble
we didn't have the gimble lock problem on the shuttle because it was a four gimble platform
but i remember we went through that with mit instrumentation many times because all you could get at that time because the imus were so big a fourth gimble was almost impossible
and mcdivitt was a very good astronaut but he wanted the four gimbles
in fact he wound up being my boss
before we go on let me just mention one more thing about the backup system
sure
go ahead
the backup system actually takes a lot of care and maintenance and there's a lot of money that goes into that
and this is not a dead issue because in the design of the cev nasa is going to have to make a decision
there were some guidelines which were produced a couple of years ago out of the johnson space center with a lot of astronaut office input about what are the requirements in the future for human space vehicles
and they put in that you should have a backup computer system because basically that's the way we did the shuttle
and actually that was an afterthought
and yet now it's being listed as a requirement
and this is now being questioned for the cev because it's a huge financial impact
and so we're going to have to deal with these problems all over again
it's an interesting thing to think about if some of you want to delve a little bit more deeply
i think this could lead to a very interesting activity for you
yes sir
do backup computers have their own sensor or are they reading the same sensors
the same sensors
i just didn't show this very accurately because i looked at the chart when i had it i said my god this is the wrong chart
but this was the original chart before the backup system so i quickly penciled in the backup system so i would remember to talk about it
but no it has the same sensors
it has all the same information
but again most of those sensors are redundant
yeah they're redundant sensors
not all of them but most of them
any one of the four computers can read any of these sensors
it's not like sensor one is dedicated
the sensor input is put on a data bus and they have multiple data buses
like four data buses in each of the computers can read all four data buses
i mean there's just a tremendous amount of redundancy built in
yes go ahead
did they ever use the star tracker to update your gyros
the platform
yeah they do that
there is also a procedure if you totally lose attitude
then you have to go right back and manually take a star site and orient
and that we've only had to do in a simulator
to look at the failure history of this would be very interesting
in my tenure i know we lost one inertial measurement unit
we lost that one computer during the approach and landing test
i don't know what other failures we actually had in this system
the mdms this box was made by sperry at the time in phoenix arizona
and i've visited that many times because that is probably the most complicated electronics box of this whole system other than the computer
it's very very complicated
yes sir
computers have developed a lot faster so why do you still think that it will be a major expense now
i don't think it will be a major expense now
as i recall and you're absolutely right nasa does not put a lot of money into development of this technology because other people have done it
it's so much more sophisticated than we have now
we don't need it
it turns out though at one point in time structures was the most expensive component of a space craft
then of course there was propulsion
and then there became avionics and software
and avionics and software for the shuttle is very very expensive
it's probably one of the most expensive things
i think today in today's environment with the technology we have in both software and hardware i think it won't be that expensive anymore
so i think you're right
that's why i'm saying in redoing it you could use new technology and really show how much less it's going to weigh because the imus are probably going to be smaller
you could reduce the weight you could reduce the electric power and you could reduce the cost
but you're going to have another detailed briefing on this
and phil hattis i know him very well i think he will do an outstanding job in explaining it to you
let me just show you very briefly we talked a little bit about this yesterday but here are some of the profiles that the guidance system has to be able to do
it certainly has to take care of launch
the abort modes which are interesting there is an abort mode that is a return to launch site
and i guess you would use return to launch site primarily for a main engine failure
i guess
if the main engine fails during ascent you can go to a return to launch site
or a total loss of cabin pressurization something like that
and i guess that's never been tried
and i guess that's probably one of the most difficult maneuvers most biggest fears the astronauts have if they ever have to come back to return to launch site
but of course the guidance system has got to be capable to take care of that
then you have abort once around
again when you have main engine cutoff you have separation and you abort to once around
again i guess that's primarily a main engine problem
and then you have of course an abort to orbit
and those are the three abort regimes you have
yes sir
transatlantic landing
transatlantic
yes you have transatlantic abort
that's right
you do have transatlantic abort
yes thank you
that actually drives the launch window because that's right
so the guidance system has to take care of all those abort modes
again i'm sure phil will go through this with you
but first stage guidance really consists of attitude and throttle schedules as a function of relative velocity
it's not completely open loop it's almost an open looped system but you do control the thrust vectors of the engine and the solid rocket booster actuators
and the key thing though where systems engineering comes into play it has to get maximum performance
but the angle tack history has got to be shaped to control aerodynamic loads
because some of the highest loads you have and you will find out when moser talks about it some of the highest loads you have on the structure is during ascent
control of maximum dynamic pressure
and you have to provide the flight angle at srb staging to allow recovery of the spent boosters
these are some of the constraints that you have
and again this comes out to be a real systems engineering problem
and for entry entry really becomes a task in itself because one of the basic problems you have to control is thermal control
the thermal protection system i should have pointed out on that structural slide that the back face temperature of the tiles have to be at three hundred fifty degrees fahrenheit
while the surface temperature may be fifteen to two thousand degrees fahrenheit the back face has to be at three hundred fifty degrees fahrenheit because that's the limit of aluminum so you've got to control the guidance
the thermal control for guidance is to keep the vehicle within the temperature constraints in the peak heating region
so that's all got to be married together so that the tile system you design keeps the back face temperature to within three hundred fifty degrees on the aluminum structure
then you go into equilibrium glide
constant bank angle we were talking about is modulated for drag control
and then the transition guides the vehicle from the high out braking to the lower angle of attack
and then you basically land
all this has to be tied together for your guidance navigation and control system
i have one more system that i'd like to talk about briefly
now you're going to have another very detailed briefing on this
this is the hydraulic system
this ties in together with the other systems we talked about the flight control system
the guidance system the department of flight control because the hydraulic system is three systems
it's a three thousand pound per square inch system
and what does it do
it basically is used during ascent and entry for it to control the thrust vector control of the engines for the body flap for the elevons for the rudder speed brake the actuators for the main engine the doors for the external tank separation main landing gear nose wheel steering and braking
so that's what the hydraulic system does
if you lose your hydraulic system you had a bad day
and there are three systems
i do believe there is one place where there's a single point failure in the hydraulic system
it's pretty hard to eliminate all single point phase
i believe that
when henry pohl talks he's going to be doing a very detailed discussion on the hydraulic system you might ask him that
i don't recall but he'll tell you whether there is a single point failure in the hydraulic system
and this is a schematic of the hydraulic system
i am not going to go through the details of it because i'm not sure i could explain it
but basically this is the hydraulic system that shows how system one system two and system three is tied into the right outboard elevon the right inboard elevon and so forth and so on
the main engines
the external tank
and we've never had a loss in the hydraulic system
we did test the hydraulic system in what we call the flight control hydraulics laboratory at downey where we had actually all the hydraulic systems tied together with the computer system
and actually flew the vehicle what we called this iron bird with a hydraulic system
and we did have a failure there one time
early in the program we had a single point failure and lost all the hydraulic fluid
we had to go back and make a major change to the actuator system to the hydraulic system
yes sir
i'm just wondering how the hydraulic system on the shuttle compares to the hydraulic system on an aircraft
an airplane
yeah
i'm really not sure i can explain it
i think there's not much difference
let me tell you the only difference
i think airplanes have three hydraulic systems
the shuttle started out with four hydraulic systems
we actually started out with four but it was so heavy and so complicated we decided to go to three
and i think the airplanes have three hydraulic systems if i'm not mistaken
does anybody know
i at least know quite a few that have three
i don't know if all airplanes have three
the big difference in it is that the hydraulic system in the shuttle is powered by what we call an auxiliary power unit
and that's what pressurizes the system
and i think on an airplane it's powered by the engine itself
but this system is pressurized by what we call an auxiliary power unit
an auxiliary power unit is a box about this big
it generates one hundred thirty five horsepower
and it's got a ten inch turbine wheel that goes about ten thousand to twenty thousand rpm
and actually it's fueled by hydrazine
and it essentially pressurizes the system to get you up to three thousand psi
again if this auxiliary power unit doesn't work we have three of them it's a bad day
and i think we did have some problems with one of the auxiliary power units at one time during ascent
but that's the major difference i think because i think we tried to copy pretty much aircraft designs using the same type of hydraulic fluid and everything else
so i think we copied their standard in using this as i recall except we're pressurized by the auxiliary power unit
again not to belabor the point you're going to have a very detailed briefing or lecture on the hydraulic system the auxiliary power unit and the reaction control system the oms system by henry pohl
so you will have more details on this
again the hydraulic system might be another interesting thing to take a look at
i hope what i'm trying to get across to you is how these systems all fit together
you cannot do the guidance navigation and control without the hydraulic system
you have the aerodynamics and you have the aerothermodynamics
you've got the structures and everything that has to fit together
and you can imagine the systems engineering problem associated with trying to put all that together
just to remind you of a few other things that you have to deal with
when you're working with a space system that also makes it a little bit different from designing for the ground
for instance you have a fuel tank with the hydrazine inert
this is a generic problem with any liquid tank
once you're in weightlessness how do you get the liquid to flow out
this is actually a fairly traditional old fashioned design where they have a diaphragm in the tank
and on one side of the diaphragm you pressurize it with either helium or nitrogen
and that pushes the material
it's basically sort of like squeezing it out of a bag
the problem is that hydrazine is nasty stuff
and in the orbiter maneuvering and reaction control systems they decided that for reusability they didn't want to use diaphragms
and so we'll probably learn more about some of the details
but there's a very elaborate screen mechanism which uses surface tension to collect the material
and just getting liquids out of a tank into where you want to go is something you have to worry about in space
the second problem is a thermal problem
you're not flying through the atmosphere so you don't have air cooling
as you see you've got the gear box
you're generating a lot of heat
and actually in order to cool they use water spray boilers
and you essentially we actually do this to get rid of heat from the orbiter as well before we open the payload bay doors which have radiators
while those are closed it has to be done with a water spray boiler
and so you get rid of all your heat by putting it into a heat exchanger
and you basically shoot liquid water
and of course in a vacuum the water flash evaporates and that takes the heat away
and so although in essence the control system is similar to airplanes even there there are a lot of special design features that have to be put in because this is a system that has to work in space as well
that's a very good point
the cooling is one of the biggest differences
and because this system is so complex and heavy and needs a lot of maintenance and uses hydrazine which is very nasty stuff there have been on various occasions studies of could this system be replaced by an electromechanical system
and as motors become more powerful and battery and fuel cell systems are more efficient
i think just about two years ago we gave up on the last effort but it always turned out to be too heavy
to get an electromechanical system which had enough muscle to move these air surfaces around it is just beyond what we can do
but that might be another good system to take a look at today
it might be another good system
the other thing
you see where it has a speed control and safety for the apu controller
the interesting thing about this turbine wheel i forget the exact rpm but it's pretty high
i think it's at least ten thousand to twenty thousand rpm
if this shaft should break off it's a very hard to control it in the box
i mean it will go right through the box it's in and share the vehicle
we've tried everything we know
we've put protection around it
we've put a lot of margin into the turbine wheel into the shaft but that's a very critical thing
and as professor hoffman mentioned there have been many exercises to replace the auxiliary power unit
and i think again this would be another good challenge to take a look at seeing what you could do to come up with a different design for the auxiliary power unit
but there will be other systems that you might want to look at
but i thought i'd just give you a little discussion of some that i personally think are very pertinent to look at
that's the thermal protection system the structures the guidance navigation and control the hydraulic system including the apu
and these i think would be a very good system
now you might pick others but these might be very good ones to look at
let me wind up my discussion by talking to you about what i think you ought to look for in the system
this is just a very simplistic chart but this is my way of thinking about what you do when you go about designing something
you need to look at the functions
as we pointed out yesterday the functions are very important because when we talked about a thermal protection system we looked at the functions of protecting the vehicle maintaining that back surface temperature to three hundred fifty degrees fahrenheit
we worked that to finite detail
we knew exactly how thick the tiles had to be what the characteristics had to be but what did we
we forgot oddly enough that it had to be attached to the vehicle which is sort of dumb
and you would think my gosh they ought to be able to do that
but you're infinitely smarter after you find out your problem
one thing you ought to do is really understand what functions have to be performed
and you might say that becomes your functional requirements
the whole thing is understanding your requirements
then you ought to understand what performance is required
in other words performance requirements
you ought to have a first order of magnitude calculation of what kind of performance requirements you need
a lot of times this is going to have come from assumptions talking to people getting experts involved
but what kind of performance requirements
it is going to have to be iterated but what kind of performance are you thinking about in this system
whatever the system may be hydraulic system thermal protection system whatever
then we talk about the three legged stool as professor hoffman said
we talk about schedule cost and output weight under performance
because as i told you before the first thing you're going to wind up in designing a system is that the weight is going to get too high
then you're going to find out that performance goes down
you have schedule slips
but the first thing that usually happens is you wake up in the morning and you find out
my gosh my system weighs a lot more my subsystem weighs a lot more than they told me i could have
so you've got to understand your weight
and then you need to think about what is the available technology
what is the technology available
as somebody pointed out today the avionics technology is probably pretty high up on the ladder
and you could probably pick something today right off the shelf
although in my experience of the thirty years i had in the space program i never was able to find something that was off the shelf
space programs just don't usually allow you to take something off the shelf
people told me to go do it
and once i went and did it we changed everything
but today in the technology we have in the avionics you may be able to get a lot off the shelf
so what technology is available
and then one of the key things one of the biggest things you have to know is what are the interfaces
if you could see the multitude of interfaces that are required for the guidance navigation and control system it takes into consideration all the interfaces you could think about
and so you need to think about interfaces whether they be mechanical whether they be electrical whether they be functional
so you need to think about what interfaces you're talking about
and to me those are some guidelines you need to think about
of course then we talk about cost and schedule
usually your cost is going to grow unfortunately and usually your schedule is going to slip
and those are what i would call career limiting problems
that's the best way to get fired to have your costs go up and you schedule increase
so these are some of my guidelines for things you ought to look for when you try to design your system
i would be happy to answer any questions for you that you may have
yes sir
about taking technology off the shelf i'm wondering and i don't think from what i know it was really thought of much during the shuttle but the idea of maybe putting something on the shelf so to speak the idea of designing something a subsystem or something so it would have the flexibility to be used in future systems
do you see where i'm going
no i don't think i quite follow what you're saying
try again
well you said there wasn't really off the shelf technology available then but maybe there is now
the idea i'm thinking about is the idea of designing something not so much just for the shuttle in this phase but so that it could be used for other things
well that's a very possible thing to do and would be a very good thing to do
in my experience and we tried something like that usually this tends to start growing into it
you start saying well what is it really going to cost you to do that
i know when i was project manager people would come to me with something like that
and i used to be a pretty mean guy
i'm not quite as mean as i used to be
but that's the first thing i'd ask them what about the cost because that's what happens
when you start trying to make multiple uses out of something you usually drive the cost up
and that's what you have to be careful of
yes sir
well let me add to that
i feel very strongly that had it not been for the mit instrumentation lab or the draper lab or the people they had there the technology they had there we wouldn't have gone to the moon when we said we were going to doing it
i mean i worked very closely with them and i feel very strongly that draper labs i keep getting them mixed up at that time the mit instrumentation lab was really one of the prime movers of the whole system
it was really fantastic
so the people working here and you can take advantage of that would be very useful for you to do that
any other questions
well i will be back on the twenty two nd
and i look forward to working with you some more
one more question
sorry
yes
it has not as much to do with the subsystems but to the overall concept of the shuttle
i was wondering why if you know at all the military thought it was important to have the ability to capture a satellite and bring it back
was it because satellites were so expensive at the time and maybe they aren't as much
because i don't think we've really done that
well it really wasn't the military
several satellites we did bring back
i cannot recall which ones
westar and palapa
i have pictures of that a little later
and we retrieved those
and it turns out interestingly enough they were insured by lloyds of london
and that was the biggest salvage operation lloyds of london ever achieved when they returned those satellites bigger than anything in the ocean they ever picked up
in fact they rang the bell
when they have a big recovery a big thing in lloyds of london they ring a bell
and they came down to serve somebody whoever he was i don't recall who he was but he was head of lloyds of london
and we had a big reception at the johnson space center after we retrieved westar and palapa
i don't think the air force really had that much demand at the time or it went away whatever it was for retrieving payloads but commercials did
what the military was interested in was the possibility of refueling satellites in orbit
that's right
we did do that
because when you have recognizant satellites very often you have to change their orbit to get them over to the right place at the right time
and orbital maneuvering fuel is a limiting commodity on satellites
and these are very expensive satellites to build
so if you have the possibility of refueling then in principle you could extend the life of these very high value assets
and we did do a demonstration
of course the fuel in most cases is hydrazine which is very nasty stuff
if you get it on your spacesuit you cannot come inside until you bake it off
it's fairly dangerous
and so we actually did do a demonstration just in the shuttle's cargo bay but we've never actually done a real refueling of a satellite in orbit
but they're still working on it
now i think the military is still working on possibly robotic refuelling technologies
for whatever the next version of the shuttle or crew vehicle would be is it necessary or even a good idea to have this huge cargo bay
well i think that's what they're eliminating
i haven't been that close to it
but the cev is going to be really a passenger carrier
and then any cargo will be on an unmanned vehicle i believe
so that's what they're separating
is that right
i mean i haven't really been that close to it
this is one of the guidelines now for future space vehicles is to the maximum extent possible separate humans and cargo
if the original concept of the shuttle had been realizable that the shuttle would be capable of flying frequently enough that it could basically satisfy all of our launch needs then you can make the argument well all right we're doing this and people are in it to fly it and we'll just do it that way
but given the fact that we cannot fulfill that goal then you have to ask why put humans at risk just to take a satellite up in the cargo bay and launch it when we can launch satellites using unmanned vehicles
and in fact that was the decision after the challenger accident was any payloads that are carried into space on the shuttle in general i mean there were some exceptions for various reasons but you ought to be using the shuttle to do things where you need people to do them
and some of those things for instance to service in the hubble or the assembly of the space station although even that could be argued that had we planned it differently we might have been able to do it without making such extensive use of the shuttle
but there we do make full use of the big cargo bay
but future human space vehicles the cev will be basically a people carrier with a small amount of cargo
and any time you want to launch large amounts of cargo you will do it without people
let's take a one or two minute break
i'm going to get my computer set up
let me put this down here
i want to give you a short presentation just to bring everybody up to a certain level of familiarity with what the shuttle does and what it looks like
and again i tend to look at this from an operational point of view
this will be informal you know ask questions as we go through
as we've said the two critical phases of shuttle operations and what makes this such a unique vehicle is it launches vertically like a spaceship with a tremendous amount of power
and it lands
you look at this and you have to remind yourself that it looks like an airplane landing and yet a half an hour ago this was a spaceship going in orbit around the earth
so it really has been a spectacular technological achievement
let's go through some of the maintenance operations what is actually done to the shuttle
we've talked about it a little bit but i think if you actually see some of the images it will help to give some reality to some of this
after the shuttle lands here it's landing on the runway at the kennedy space center
and as we mentioned all of this is a bird sanctuary so sometimes you have to chase the birds away
and there's a problem from time to time with crosswinds
there is only one runway so if you get wind blowing across the runway at more than fifteen knots you cannot land
and so that's also a constraint sometimes to launch because when you take off you always have to be able to turn around and come back and land here just like you have to be able to land over in europe or africa
and so there are a lot of launch constraints
what they do is this was actually hooked up back on the runway but they hook up air conditioning units
they have to purge
there's an ammonia boiler
remember we talked about getting rid of heat as you're coming in using water spray boilers
but once you get below one hundred thousand feet the pressure is actually above the triple point of water and you cannot flash evaporate anymore
and so they switch from a water boiler to an ammonia boiler
and so after the shuttle lands there are ammonia fumes all over the place
if you've looked at pictures of shuttle servicing on the runway sometimes if there isn't actually wind blowing they bring around a big fan to blow the ammonia way
and everybody has to stay upwind of the ammonia
and there is also the possibility of course that there might be a hydrazine leak or who knows
anyway the orbiter has to be safe
and you have the people come out in what looks like space suits
escape suits they call them
self contained i don't remember the acronym
but in any case we're bringing the orbiter back to the hanger area where it will undergo a lot more than fourteen days of servicing
i remember again just to give you a sense of the state of mind before we were actually operating the shuttle as a new astronaut back in one thousand nine hundred seventy eight
remember the shuttle didn't fly until eighty one
we were getting a series of lectures on all the shuttle systems
and i remember the lecture they gave us on turnaround which was supposed to take fourteen days
and we got a briefing from the people who were planning the turnaround
and i remember they told us we've studied this really carefully and we just don't think it's going to be possible to turn the shuttle around in fourteen days
we've cut out every unnecessary step and we think it's impossible to do it in less than sixteen days
and that's kind of the way people were thinking
we were talking about it's supposed to make sixty flights a year and people were skeptical
there is no way they can make more than forty flights a year
people just didn't have a concept of how complex it was going to be to operate this vehicle because it is such a complex vehicle
to operate it safety is difficult
now sometimes it lands in california
and in that case you put it on the seven hundred forty seven
this is the same bipod fitting just to essentially duplicate the way that the orbiter is put on the external tank and the tail pod is of course for aerodynamics
and that was also the configuration for the approach and landing tests
and actually later i think in the middle of october gordon fullerton who was one of nasa's premier test pilots he still flies i mean i'll have to find out from him how many different types of airplanes he's flow he's just an amazing guy but he was actually in the shuttle during that first approach and landing test
so he can tell us about what it was actually like test flying the shuttle as well as being on the third orbital flight test
yes
were they carrying anything on the airplane
you mean inside here
yeah
no this is not your opportunity for a transcontinental vacation trip
i mean there are a few people who ride along with it because you need the maintenance people
they also have an airplane flying about fifty miles in front of this checking for turbulence
and in the early days they had a chase airplane as well
i told people they were crazy trying to get them to do this because i thought it was the dumbest thing i heard of
ok
now a look at some of the details
remember we talked about how the engines are taken out
you get a little bit of a view here inside the engine compartment
i had the chance on numerous occasions to actually go inside the engine compartment
i mean it's just amazing
you get these huge big pipes
and it really helps when you're going to be using a system like this
we spent a lot of time in the simulators
and you'll flip a switch and that switch controls what they call the main fuel shutoff valve
it's a big butterfly valve about seventeen inches in diameter inside this huge pipe
and you sit in the simulator and you flick the switch and the talk back shows that the thing is closed
and then you actually go in the compartment and you look and there's this huge pipe and this area
and you realize this huge thing that's moving around
and it kind of gives a sense of realism
and in fact that's one of the big safety concerns
when the fuel is flowing the butterfly valve is in a vertical position so the fuel flips by it
obviously it's an unstable situation
if it goes out just a little bit then the fuel flow can slam it closed and you've got an explosion on your hands
so that was a major consideration
this is the body flap
so you can see all of the plumbing
and all these red things are removed before flight stickers
it's a very very complex process
and they pull the engines out after every flight now
that's the thing all of the platforms have to be designed so that they fold up and they fold down so that you can get access to all the places
i mean it's a very complex system
and a lot of the equipment the launch platforms and everything as we mentioned were adapted from the apollo program
but the hangers which we call the opf the orbiter processing facility was built specifically for the shuttle
the tiles we talked about
i mean that's just a huge amount of work replacing maintaining and testing the tiles
this is inside the cargo bay
you've got the fuel cells
you've got hydrogen and oxygen cryogenic tanks
helium pressurization tanks
nitrogen for your atmospheric system
this is the bulkhead in front of which on one side you have the engine compartment
on the other side you have the crew compartment
and like we mentioned this has to be done essentially in clean room conditions and yet it's on the scale of a battleship
so it's a real challenge
this is the forward window
on maybe one in every five flights we'll get a little ding on the windshield from a little piece of usually orbital debris
in fact more often than not it turns out to be little paint chips
whenever they do that they remove the window they replace it and do a chemical analysis to see whether it was a micrometeorite or a piece of space debris
the windows actually there are three panes
there's a redundant pressure pane
the two panes on the inside are capable of holding pressure and the outer is a thermal pane
this is one of the orbital maneuvering system pods
these are removable because again they contain nitrogen tetroxide and hydrazine
and we mentioned the fact that these are called hypergolic fuels
when you bring them together they ignite spontaneously as opposed to hydrogen and oxygen you need a spark igniter
so in that one sense it's a nice system because when you want to use them in your reaction control and you only want a very tiny tenth of a second pulse you don't have to worry about an igniter which is a potential failure point
you just squirt in the hydrazine and the nitrogen tetroxide
but they're very nasty stuff
they are extremely toxic and of course highly combustible and they are very corrosive
so these pods are serviced in a place far away from where the other activities take place for the orbiter so just in case there is a leak or an explosion it's not going to take down the rest of the critical facilities
this is the orbiter maneuvering engine and then they also have these smaller reaction control engines
and there are two aft pods
and all the fuel tanks with the hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide are in here
the aft system the two pods they actually have inner connects so that you can actually cross feed from one system to the other
and all of that stuff has to be hooked up
the forward system is independent
you cannot cross feed to that
the landing gears
we talked a little bit the other day about the tires
these things sit up in space for two weeks at a time
you've got to worry about thermal control
i mean can you imagine if you had a slow leak and you found out that your tire was flat before you started your reentry
and then of course the problem of sealing this against the hot gas
the tiles on the edge of the doors for the landing gear that's a very critical section
anyway after typically about a three month turnaround in the hanger they wheel the orbiter
actually originally it was pulled over on its own wheels but that required that they then stow the wheels in this big vertical assembly building
this is the vertical assembly building
hopefully you've seen pictures of it
it's huge
it was actually built to assemble the saturn rockets
it's much taller than we need for the orbiter stack but it has been adapted
so what goes on here is it's wheeled into the big vertical assembly building
there it is actually on the inside
you just don't get a sense of the size of this building from any picture that can be taken
you have to be there and see it to really appreciate it
in the meantime you remember the solid rocket boosters are recovered after every flight
and the liberty star and i think the freedom star that's the nasa navy
these boats are positioned out offshore
and they actually have divers who go down and put in plugs and floatation devices so that they actually float the boosters
and they drag them back where they're disassembled and cleaned up
the actual segments which contain the fuel are shipped back to utah to thiokol which is now atk for cleaning refilling
and the other parts the nozzle and the top which contains the electronics and the parachutes those are serviced in florida
and then they're brought in segments into the vehicle assembly building where they are stacked
and remember those are the segment sizes
some of these are assembled in the factory
those are the so called factory joints
and then were these come together that's the so called field joint and that's the joint that failed in the challenger accident
this gives you a sense of the size of those solid rocket motors in the way the solid fuel is put in
and they do all of these tests to look for the roundness of the motor and the flatness of the propellant
yeah
is that the fuel itself
it is
although what confuses me about this is i'm not sure which segment this is because most of the fuel is actually put in with a star pattern in it and they actually shape the way it's loaded so that you shape the thrust profile
and i've not been able to get a good explanation of why that is not the case here
in any case this is now the process where they lift one segment they put it down on top of another
of course all of these are hazardous activities
and nobody is allowed except for the critical personnel nobody's allowed in the vab when they're doing this just in case there is a problem
and then they actually put all of these bolts in to join up the field joint
and now of course after challenger we have a new and improved o ring configuration
now we have the two solid rocket boosters sitting on the mobile launch platform
and again you can see you have to design all of these platforms so you have access
now the external tank we talked about
this is in
this has actually been damaged not too heavily but it did suffer damage from katrina
this is the oxygen tank upfront
notice how small this is compared to this is the big hydrogen tank
and then this is actually the front side but this is then turned around and the two are joined together inside the outer shell
and of course the solids are joined to the external tank the orbiter is joined to the external tank so basically the external tank needs a strong back mechanism inside it because that's ultimately what's tying the whole stack together
and the trust from the solids and the thrust from the main engines ultimately they're linked together through the external tanks
so the tanks themselves the hydrogen and oxygen tanks don't have a lot of beefy structure
but going through this is a very heavy structure
yeah
the hydrogen tank there is about the diameter of the overall structure
yeah
that gives another idea of the scale
this is cleaning and polishing inside the big hydrogen tank
i mean again the scale of all of this it's important to get a sense of what's involved in taking care of these vehicles
do you know if they actually had to go in and scrub it by hand
i guess
i mean the scrubbing is only part of it
the inspection is the really critical thing to see if there is anything that's not quite right
one thing that's interesting the use of liquid oxygen liquid hydrogen is wanted so much because of its higher performance
but on the other hand if you would do something like liquid oxygen and kerosene you would get a much smaller tank or some other propellant
and there is a tradeoff
i think today people are realizing especially from the russians the russians don't really use liquid hydrogen
you get a lower isp but your tanks become so much smaller to deal with
and hydrogen is very hard to deal with
it's very hard to find the hydrogen level and hydrogen is very hard to deal with
my second flight do you remember
that was the one with the hydrogen leaks remember that
we were supposed to launch in may of one thousand nine hundred ninety
and we went down
and before they fill the system they do a helium leak check
and of course helium for those of you who have worked with vacuum systems helium will leak through anything
and if the system is tight against helium they figure it is tight
the problem is that that's done at ambient temperature
and when you fill it with the cryogenic hydrogen everything contracts
and so things which were vacuum tight at ambient temperature are not always vacuum tight
but the problem is you don't know that until you fill it which is only done a few hours before a launch
so we had gone down to the cape
we were in medical quarantine
and we just got the message about six hours before launch there's a hydrogen leak launch is scrubbed
they did some checks
they drained the tank
they did another helium leak check
it was fine
we had gone back to houston
we came back
the same thing happened
how long did it take
well in the end we made six trips over the course of six months
and we didn't launch until december
and actually another one of the shuttles also had a hydrogen leak
they actually alternated us
they pulled us off the launch pad
they put somebody else on
i mean what had happened was they had somewhat changed the procedure of installing some o rings in these big hydrogen lines and it required a process where the workers were actually working in an area where they couldn't see
and the o rings were being installed slightly wrong
but it was just terribly difficult to track that down
so yeah there are a lot of problems using cryogenic fuel
now the other thing is if you have a fully staged vehicle with a separate first and second stage one of the things that you learn in rocket propulsion classes is that in the first stage the specific impulse is not nearly as important
what's really important is to get a lot of thrust
in your upper stages having a high isp becomes much more important in terms of the payload that you can carry
so if you had a fully staged vehicle and in fact that's the way saturn worked
the first stage of saturn was kerosene and liquid oxygen and the upper stages were cryogenic with hydrogen and oxygen just for that reason
ok let's move on
now we have the external tank again suspended in the vertical assembly building
that's lifted up and joined between the two srbs
this is the feed line where the oxygen comes down and this is where these two feeds lines this is the hydrogen
and then the orbiter has two corresponding feed ports where the hydrogen and oxygen comes into the engine
and actually when you fill the tank on the pad you actually put the hydrogen and oxygen into the orbiter
and it flows from the orbiter back then into the external tank
and it was on this oxygen fitting from the foam that they put around this was what fell off in the recent discovery flight where they did get a big piece of foam
ok so now we go back
remember we brought the orbiter over into the vertical assembly building
now you put this strong back to hold the orbiter
and this is really spectacular
i mean you lift the whole orbiter up off the ground and tilt it up
and you basically hang it and lower it
and these are big pieces of equipment and yet you need millimeters of accuracy
so very skilled crane operators to say the least
now we have the orbiter and the strong back laid down in position and all of the mating is done
and we're on the pad
excuse me we're on the mobile launch platform and they put the crawler transporter underneath it and then they roll it on these specially prepared pads which have very i don't know how deep it goes into the ground but this is heavy river gravel
most of the boulders are about the size of your fist but after one or two trips of the orbiter it's crushed down to the size of pea gravel
and then they have to replace it with new stuff
and of course as you're going out to the pad when you're rolling up to the launch pad you're actually going up at an angle
and so this whole system you can see the crawlers down here each one of these treads each single piece of the tread weighs a ton
just to give you a sense it goes about one or two miles per hour top speed
it takes hours to get out there
and it has to be capable of staying level to within a few degrees even as you're climbing the ramp up to the launch platform
what are those things supporting the
the whole stack is basically sitting on the two srbs
the skirts of the srbs is taking the weight
these are the fuel inputs which are connected through the other side where the hydrogen and the oxygen run into the shuttle
and from there the way i showed you before it goes into the external tank
did they also keep it tilted back
did it have the tendency to
each of the srbs has four bolts
actually they give us as a souvenir after a flight they give us the big nuts that are explosive bolts
there are eight four on each of the srbs
and essentially that's what gives it its stability
again this is a hill
it's a little hard to see the perspective but keeping the whole thing steady
and we talked about how you can see this track here where the payload change out room eventually could come around and cover the shuttle to give it protection
this is actually going up the hill to get up
and it's just a pretty picture that i like
and here we are
this is nice because you have both shuttles on the launch pad
this is a big water tower
in order to protect the launch pad against flame damage and also to protect the shuttle against acoustic effects they actually get a shockwave when you ignite the engines which can bounce back and do some damage
shortly about fifteen seconds before t zero they open up the valves
and all that water flows with little jets
if you've seen pictures of a launch sometimes they show that as part of the launch sequence
in fact in another class i will show you some of the details of an actual launch picture
that's the water deluge and that goes for about thirty seconds
and that cushions the acoustic load reflected back to the shuttle
ok that's enough pictures on the pad
oh i know what i wanted to show
this is called the white room
and that's how the crew goes in
you take an elevator up to here
and then that actually joins up with the hatch
so the hatch is sitting open
and you put on your parachutes and the last few pieces of equipment to get in
and this is a view inside the white room
this is i guess from our last flight in one thousand nine hundred ninety six
and when you go out on launch day the big thing that you notice that's different is there are very few people on the pad only the essential personnel
and the whole stack is creaking because it's now filled with the cryogens and everything is shrunk and it's sort of alive in a very strange way
so we talked about the mission profile
i won't deal with this
and i do want to talk about some of the shuttle aborts but we will do that another time because i want to get finished with the slides
i did want to show you after challenger they introduced a bailout
we did mention that the basic survivability for the crew requires an intact orbiter
it used to be that it needed an intact orbiter landing on the ground or ditching in the ocean
which was kind of an unlikely survivability because you're going to hit the ocean at two hundred knots and probably break up
so now there are circumstances where you can lose more than one engine during launch or you might have to do an emergency de orbit where you basically can be flying along at forty thousand feet stably but with no place to land
and so that's really the only situation which the bailout system protects you against but there is a collapsible poll
the reason for that is because the aerodynamic studies show that if you just jumped out of the open hatch with a parachute the airflow would carry you back on top of the wing and you'd hit the oms pod and that would not be a good deal
so you actually hook yourself to this escape poll
and that takes you down below the wing and then you can open the parachute
and we actually practiced this where you go out into a swimming pool using the escape poll
these are some actual tests conducted by army parachutists in i think a one hundred forty one transport
the system has been tested in flight although never with the shuttle
and that's the test where they have a simulated hatch and you basically jump out into the swimming pool
once again into the white room
you can see the hatch out here
and that's the last thing that they'll do is they close the hatch
then they pressurize the shuttle by about one point five psi just to make sure that it has pressure integrity before a launch
and then we launch
as you can see you're burning hydrogen and oxygen in the main engines
what's coming out there is just hot steam not very visible
most of the smoke the noise and everything come from the solid rocket boosters
however you do need these engines
in fact people have calculated that if you tried to take off without these main engines pushing up on the shuttle that the attachment between the shuttle and the external tank would probably fail
each of the main engines is about well it's a half a million pounds of thrust in vacuum
it's slightly under four hundred thousand pounds at sea level
you've got a little over a million pounds coming from the main engines but these are putting out almost three million pounds a piece
so most of your early thrusts in the first two minutes are coming from the solid rocket boosters
and it's a pretty rough ride
i mean there's a lot of vibration
when you go through mach one which is max q maximum dynamic pressure the vibrations are even more pronounced
the first time on my first flight i really thought the wings were going to come off there was so much vibration
but of course they don't
but i'd love to get a hold of it
i actually saw a high speed well a slow motion picture actually looking at the tail as you go through max q
and you can actually see the tail fluttering back and forth like that
i mean the aerodynamic loads on the vehicle during ascent are significant
and you do actually have to move your elevons to what's called load relief in order to take the stress off that
i really like this
it gives a sense of the power that you're sitting on top of to get up there
and that's just a nice picture of riding the fire
ok so you get up in orbit and you drop the external tank
and although now they're going out of their way to take even better close ups of the tank to look at the foam shedding
we've been doing that in fact throughout the history
now they especially time the launch so that you're guaranteed to drop the external tank with good lighting conditions
that didn't used to be a constraint to launch but it is now
you can also by the way see how the atmosphere quickly fades out into space
and that's a telephoto so it actually makes the atmosphere look even thicker than it really looks
ok so there is the orbiter in space
that was actually after it had delivered a payload
this was taken from the space station
and just a quick reminder of all the different things that we've used the orbiter for
launching satellites you've seen that picture
this is a payload assist module to take the satellite from the shuttle orbit up to geosynchronous transfer orbit
we have used it extensively for satellite repair in orbit
this is the intelsat where it was put into orbit by an expendable rocket but into a bad orbit because of underperformance
and they managed to get it into a shuttle compatible orbit
and i won't go through the whole history
why there happened to be three people out there is a whole story in itself
this is one of the satellites
again the satellites were put into orbit by the shuttle
and the shuttle deployment was fine but the payload assist module which you saw before did not perform properly
and so the two satellites were stranded in a useless orbit
we actually brought them back to the ground
they were refurbished and re launched again on expendable rockets
the shuttle has also been used as a space station with the space lab on in the inside to carry out scientific experiments
this is a large pressurized module which is put into the cargo bay
and the original idea as professor cohen mentioned was you could just take your laboratory equipment off the shelf plug it in here one hundred twenty volts ac power i guess and it would be just like working on the ground
well it never was
but having said that i think the space lab program as a whole was extremely successful
and then it's been used to service the mir space station
we certainly added several years of useful life to the mir station because we could carry up a lot more equipment than the russians could themselves
and that also gave us an opportunity to get some us astronauts on long duration space missions
and then as you all know we're using the shuttle to construct the international space station
and hopefully we'll get more of it built before too long
the shuttle is also an excellent platform for performing evas space walks
and that's a picture of when we went up and repaired the hubble space telescope
i cannot overestimate the capability that the shuttle gives us as a work platform in orbit
we can do this sort of complex eva activity on the space station but once we retire the shuttle we've essentially lost that capability
to have the manipulator arm and to be able to use people and the robotic arm to move equipment around it's just a very powerful work platform
that's one of my favorite pictures floating up there
this is a pretty picture of firing the orbiter maneuvering engines just to start your descent into the atmosphere
despite the fact that you're going at eighteen thousand miles an hour you only have to slow down by a few hundred feet per second in order to lower your perigee down to essentially the surface of the earth so that half an orbit later you intersect with the atmosphere
and of course that produces the aerodynamic heating which you can see on the outside
this is looking out to the front
that's kind of a dull glow
it starts out as a deep red and then it gets orange and yellow and finally white on the outside
the most spectacular thing you know you're a meteor
this is a picture that was taken from houston
this is at about two hundred fifty thousand feet at about mach twelve on the way to a landing at the kennedy space center
the shuttle is flying like this
if you look up at the overhead windows you can actually look back into the wake
and this is really spectacular because you have these different colors and it's sort of shimmering around
and every once in a while when i would be looking at this you'd see a big bright light
and i would think boy i hope that was nothing important
what people said it probably was were little bits of gap filler
you may have heard that on the last flight they discovered that some gap fillers were protruding
and so steve robinson went around and actually pulled some of them out
but they've probably been doing that the whole time and just have come off
i mean this little point where you have the convergence of the shockwaves this is about ten thousand degrees fahrenheit that's the surface temperature of the sun
it's a spectacular visual view
and then again at this point we're just going subsonic flying like a glider and ready for touchdown
so i hope that gives you some sense visually of what goes on in the course of a shuttle flight with an emphasis on the maintenance operations
without appreciating how complex it is to operate this system i think it's hard to really make the link between the original concept and the difficulties we've had in getting the shuttle to perform in terms of the turnaround maintainability
so again just wrapping up that's kind of my farewell picture the shuttle was an amazingly ambitious concept
and i think what has been astounding is how well the shuttle has been able to perform and do all the things that it was designed to do in terms of the satellite launching and being used as a science platform performing eva repairing satellites building space stations
it has given us experience and capability to learn how to do things in earth orbit which we never had before
and as i say we may well miss them once we retire the shuttle
but where we really did get it wrong and this will be one of the things that we'll look at when we deal with the individual subsystems is in the operations
it turned out to be a lot more complex expensive and delicate to operate than had been anticipated
so hopefully there will come a time when we set out to design another reusable vehicle possibly a reusable winged vehicle
and i think a lot of what we've learned from the shuttle will be folded into that
it still is a question of how re usable the next crew exploration vehicle the cev will be
re usability has been put in as a requirement but that remains to be seen
and certainly the experience that we've gotten from the shuttle is going to make people look really really closely at what assumptions we're making about the reusability whenever we do this again
ok
next tuesday will be the last in kind of the conceptual part of what we're doing
professor john logsdon from george washington university is a very well known space policy analyst
he did a seminal study on the apollo program and has also written a lot and done a lot of research on the origins of the shuttle
and so he'll talk to us then
let's see
i had promised to post everybody's emails on the web and i got diverted and didn't get that done
but i will do that before tomorrow you know in terms of forming your teams
put together an idea of what system you would like to work at
if you're not able to form up as part of a team between now and tuesday just give me what your own personal preference is
and then we can look and see if different people are interested in the same system
we'll let you all know and help you form up teams
i'll make sure your email is there in the student view
if you've already formed a group then just turn in something as a group
that's fine
if not if you haven't hooked up with somebody just let us know what system you're interested in working at and any ideas you might have of what you're going to look at
really this is just a very very short write up essentially to get you started
and that way if you have any questions we can talk about it next tuesday
you probably noticed professor cohen is a little bit more formal and wears a tie
and so when he's here i also wear a tie
but today we're a little bit less formal and so no ties
but i'll probably have one on on thursday again
just so that you knew what the code was
tom moser is coming
you know that was the generation where everybody wore ties
so i'll wear a tie too
anyway despite the fact that we're a little bit more informal that doesn't imply any intellectual informality
we are actually i think very fortunate that professor john logsdon who is the director of the space policy institute at george washington university which is part of their elliott school of international affairs and we have a recent graduate of that program
he is going to talk to us today
and this is really going to be the last in the looks at kind of the policy which led to the original requirements on the space shuttle
and as we've pointed out on numerous occasions when you're looking at systems engineering of any scale project well anything really
it is absolutely critical to get the requirements straight
and we cannot really understand a lot of the technical issues with the space shuttle and the challenges that we had to face without understanding how it got to be that way
professor logsdon has written numerous articles about the shuttle
and do you have an electronic version of your science article
you don't
we'll have to dig that up
we'll give you a version of that
but before that actually i guess the work where he really achieved a national recognition was his book on the apollo program the decision to go to the moon which was a history of the apollo program
professor logsdon is a recognized expert is space policy
you will see numerous articles by him in space news
and he is often the first person who gets called by the new york times or national public radio or one of the other media for comments on various developments in space
and actually depending on how the talk today goes on the shuttle in terms of time if there is some time left over he's brought some information about the new exploration architecture which was just announced formally yesterday
and given that we're setting out on another large space project where a lot of the same issues that we had to deal with about the shuttle will also apply i think it would be interesting for people in the class to start following what's going on in this new space system
so that's enough from me
john i'll turn it over to you
and take it away
good morning
what i'm going to do this morning is somewhat different from what you just announced in the sense that i'm not going to talk about the political history of the shuttle requirements as much as the political history of the shuttle and how the requirements interacted with that political history
so it may be the same thing
but i'm not a technical person
although you have a bachelor's degree in physics which is a well hidden fact
yes
next tuesday is the one hundred th anniversary of the publication of the equation e equals mc squared
and my degree in physics is almost before that not quite
one of the things that we've been doing at george washington university seemingly forever
and close to it it started in one thousand nine hundred ninety is a project to collect the seminal documents that define the evolution of the us space program
there are now six volumes of this size printed we're working on seven and there is one more to follow called exploring the unknown
jeff thinks that it's in your library
i'm going to try to get an electronic version of what i'll just talk about in a moment to put on your class website
volume four which doctor hoffman has at his home not in his office deals with access to space
and one section of volume four deals with the shuttle
and that's what i'm going to try to get an electronic copy of for you
what i've done is built this talk around the original documents that trace the policy history of the shuttle
and i'll use them kind of as backdrop
as nasa approached the end of the apollo program its leaders or at least some of them were thinking about what followed apollo
and at that time the head of i'll say manned spaceflight and apologize for the gender specific language
but that indeed was the office of manned spaceflight in the late sixty s
its head was a very creative character named george miller who is still active
he's one of the founders and moving spirits in a thing called kistler aerospace that wants to provide alternative commercial access to space
miller gave this talk as you see august of one thousand nine hundred sixty eight
as far as anyone can tell it's the first use of the term efficient earth to orbit space transportation system and economical space shuttle
miller's concept of the shuttle which had a lot of influence in one strain of its development was rather grandiose in character
especially the notion that the shuttle would operate in a mode similar to large commercial air transports and work in and out of major airports
landing would be completely automated with prime dependence on spacecraft guidance with ground control backup
and this is a long talk
it's in the book i just mentioned
then its basic design could be applied to point to point transport
if the space shuttle were used as a global transport safety and comfort standards could be comparable to those of a large transport jet
it was probably not like business class in a seven hundred forty seven
maybe like the concorde
but that's certainly what they were talking about with the national aerospace plane
i mean if you can develop a plane that can take off from a runway and fly into orbit
and you remember when we talked about the rocket equation we tried to make it clear why that is such a difficult thing to do
but if you could do it then you don't have to go all the way to orbit
you can just go halfway to orbit and land in tokyo after you take off from london or new york
right
and this kind of holy grail reduction in cost by two orders of magnitude that was the mental set of the guy who i would call at least the policy father of the space shuttle is that you could have an aircraft like operations two orders of magnitude of a level of safety and reliability and operability that it could even be used for commercial transport
as you know nasa was successful in carrying out its mission of getting humans to the moon in july of one thousand nine hundred sixty nine
when nixon came into office in january of one thousand nine hundred sixty nine he had a transition taskforce on space
and that taskforce told him that there was a need for some decisions on what to do after apollo
with the focus on getting apollo done the then head of nasa jim webb didn't like long range planning
he wanted the politicians to tell nasa what to do rather than the other way around
nasa was woefully unprepared for what it wanted to do after apollo
and the country hadn't discussed it at all
nixon appointed a so called space task force space task group and asked it for definitive recommendations on the post apollo space program
that task group was chaired by the vice president who traditionally has had the space portfolio in most administrations
at that time was a well known space expert named spiro agnew
you're all too young for that to even be a joke
he was later caught taking bribes in the white house and resigned in shame
he was a typical maryland politician which means corrupt
that's my home state
the space task group was captured by nasa by its then administrator tom paine who was a very bravado character
he told nasa that they should be swashbuckling
and by miller who had developed a long range plan for nasa
and ultimately by wernher von braun who was brought up to washington to add the charisma to the plan
the report that was submitted by the space task group to the white house two months after apollo eleven had these recommendations for what nasa should do
this was what nasa really wanted to do mars starting in one thousand nine hundred eighty one a hundred man space base in the mid eighty s
the program that was recommended ultimately was program two which had mars in eighty six
and you see these comparative accomplishments
and in here was an earth to orbit space shuttle for some time between seventy five and seventy seven
that's where the shuttle entered into national policy was in nixon's reaction or in the country's reaction to nasa's post apollo proposal
again just to give you a sense of this kind of thinking at that point i'm not sure where this came from to be frank
but you take the station the space based and other stuff in this maximum program and you're talking total space shuttle flights a year peaking in eighty three with sixty six flights a year including thirty four to service a six man base and a six man orbiting station at the moon
so these truly grandiose ideas of what might be done
i don't think it was ever clear why you had to go to the moon every other week in order to maintain a six man base either
no i think it was not every other week
thirty flights a year
i think it was a three month rotation of a crew
but they've got thirty point forty flights a year
maybe logistics flights i don't know
logistics
and you're doing two things
you've got a six person station in orbit around the moon
why
i don't know
and a six person base
the architecture it was announced yesterday culminates in the buildup of a four or more person lunar base with a passing mention that oh yeah we might go to mars
by the way if anybody has comments or questions interrupt me
otherwise i'll just drone on
yeah larry
to what extent was the space station's existence importance for the shuttle back in the seventy s
it was the reason for its existence
at this point the reason to have a space shuttle was to take crew and supplies to the station period at least in the core nasa planner's ideas
you had people like miller who left the agency in september of sixty nine with these very grandiose ideas
he was succeeded by dale myers who i understand has already talked to you
and myers was very instrumental in the negotiations that led ultimately to the decision to go forward with the station
i remember the first time i heard the word space shuttle
as jeff said i've been at this a long time
i finished the book the decision to go to the moon published by mit press but out of print in late one thousand nine hundred sixty eight
we tried to market it as a paperback
we were going to put a rocket and a girl on the cover and the inside story of why kennedy sent us to the moon
it didn't work
it had footnotes and all because it was a phd dissertation
talking to an audience like this they understand what a phd dissertation looks like
i went down to attend my first launch which was apollo eleven and for some reason hadn't rented a car so i was figuring on hitching a ride from orlando to coco beach
and the person that i ended up driving to was a man named leroy day
did you know roy day
roy was at that time running the phase a studies of the space shuttle
and he told me what he was doing
it was the first time i had heard of the concept
see i don't know where this came from but it's the kind of thinking of the need for this
so to go to your point larry
when nasa first presented its post apollo plans to the congress in the spring of one thousand nine hundred seventy the program was called station shuttle
and they were coupled at the hip
and so it was the integral justification from the nasa side
although people like dale myers were already negotiating with their counterparts in the department of defense for potential military use of the system
although almost clearly this is before any military involvement or really commercial involvement came in because when you look there are only two unmanned satellites per year
this is the manifest to implement this
and that was purely as nasa program
there was not much consideration of other users of the shuttle at this point because this was enough to justify the investment in a new vehicle
again the logic was that you could put these big things in space like space stations but the logistics costs would drive you crazy if you were doing it with expendables
and so the only way to operate a permanent outpost in orbit or beyond was to have reusability in the supply system in the transportation system
that was in essence the number one requirement
unfortunately well i don't know whether it was unfortunate but in reality the nixon administration was not having any of this
nixon made a statement in response to the space task force report as you'll see march of one thousand nine hundred seventy
so it took him six months to respond to the report
meanwhile nasa's budget was getting chopped to pieces
but it was essentially a fundamental one hundred eighty degree change in policy from apollo
now apollo was separate leaps requiring a massive concentration of energy
space must take their proper place within a rigorous system of national priorities must be planned in conjunction with all the other undertakings
in other words space has to be compared in its priority to all the other demands on the federal budget
and at least for the nixon administration but in reality for every administration since the answer has been essentially the same
when kennedy made his speech saying we should go to the moon in one thousand nine hundred sixty one the nasa budget jumped eighty nine percents the first year one hundred one percents the second year thirty eight percents the third year
and it's like a rollercoaster that gets to the top of the first hill
and the program has been living on that momentum every since
and you came down that hill very quickly
you see by seventy three or seventy four this value was percent of the federal budget so it's kind of a constant measure
as the budget goes up nasa gets essentially the same share of the federal budget
about seven tenths or eight tenths of one percent
and has gotten that share for thirty five years
and this i would say is the way the democratic political system makes policy choice is through budget allocations
and if you have the same budget allocation essentially for thirty five years i would say that's where space ranks in the scheme of national priorities according to the political leadership in the white house and congress
just to flip ahead to two thousand four one of the fundamental premises in the bush vision for space exploration is that nasa will stay at this level of expenditures
and that everything you want to do going back to the moon eventually to mars has to be within that budget envelope which means you have to design to that
and remember the fundamental systems engineering triad we talked about on several occasions cost schedule performance
that clearly demonstrates cost is a fixed parameter
we don't have the freedom
either for the shuttle or in this future program cost is going to go up by very much
just in case anybody asks what these two blips are this one is the replacement of challenger after the one thousand nine hundred eighty six shuttle accident
it's a one time cost of building another orbiter
and this was bush forty one you may remember or no who announced a space exploration initiative on the twenty th anniversary of apollo
and he provided an increase in budget resources to carry out that initiative which when bill clinton was elected quickly got undone
and you see the result in the past few years
in a sense that decision that space had to be planned in the context of all other priorities has had multiple impacts over thirty five years
the first thing is nasa has never accepted it and has always tried to do more than it has resources
and one of the things jeff didn't say was that i was a member of the columbia accident investigation board after the last accident
one of the things we said in our report was that nasa had for too many years been trying to do too much with too little
and it created the kinds of stresses in the organization that led to some of the organizational sloppiness that was at least a contributing factor in the columbia accident
it told nasa that it could not pursue in the seventy s a post apollo program that was anywhere near its ambitions
and so nasa had to reinvent its program from what it had proposed in one thousand nine hundred sixty nine
and by the end of one thousand nine hundred seventy this is how budgets get done
this is a letter from the then head of nasa jim fletcher transmitting nasa's recommendations for the next year's budget
this happened last monday september the twelve th this year nasa submitted its formal budget proposal to the white house
every year this starts the process
well you can read all this rhetoric later
nasa had decided that the key element in the program for the seventy s was not the space station by now but the space shuttle
it supports the last four of the presidents' six objectives these four
and reflecting that decision nasa announced we have made a major decision to defer development of a space station to a later time and to orient the space station studies towards modular systems that can be launched as well as serviced by the space shuttle again a fundamental change in plans
the station that nasa was planning in one thousand nine hundred sixty nine would have been launched by the saturn five
would have been thirty three feet across have lots of habitable space be big a twelve person minimum building up to fifty person maybe eventually one hundred person outpost
this represented a major shift that said number one the shuttle becomes our number one priority not the station and the shuttle has to be designed to launch space station modules
that was the overriding nasa goal
and so i would argue or suggest that this decision made in late one thousand nine hundred seventy only separated in time shuttle and station that the intimate link between the two programs remained
it was just going to do them in sequence rather than at the same time
and here we are thirty five years later
and the major issue in getting started on exploration remains what do you do with the shuttle what do you do with the station
they are now seen as mortgages that have to be paid or obstacles to the next systems or however you want to characterize
what this also meant is that the traffic model that was justifying the shuttle of all these launches to space stations and lunar bases that you saw was no longer operative
and so beginning at the start of one thousand nine hundred seventy and all the way through this two year complex decision process the office of management and budget kept saying well how do you justify this investment
you're talking about a multi billion dollar investment in the future
what is the justification for it
this was the first time in the early seventy s that the white house through its office of management and budget used cost effectiveness analysis cost benefit analysis as a tool in budget allocations
it had not been done certainly not been done in the space program of the sixty s
but omb insisted that nasa show an economic justification for this investment
and in order to make it come out the way omb wanted it to come out which was that there was no justification how much economics do any of you get in this environment
i have never had an economics course except at jesuit undergraduate college called christian economics which may be a contradiction
never mind
but i'm going to say something i don't have a clue of what it means which is that omb insisted that nasa use a ten percents discount rate which is the future value of current money
and that's much higher than the discount rate applied to many other investments because this was a long term and risky investment
and so that meant the economic justification for the shuttle had to be very strong
and throughout this process there was this constant pressure on one hand to justify the shuttle economically
the only way that could be done absent a space station or an ambitious nasa program was finding other users
and this goes back to your comment earlier
nasa became not just a kind of suitor of the military as a user of the shuttle but the economic justification for going ahead with the shuttle became totally dependent on the military willingness to use the vehicle
and military is a euphemism
many of the payloads that were being discussed there were intelligence payloads operated by the organization called the national reconnaissance office which at that time the existence of the national reconnaissance office itself was classified
so you could not say nro satellites
you can say it now
nro's existence was declassified in one thousand nine hundred ninety two
but at that point was all called air force or dod satellite many of which including the most demanding were intelligence satellites
the primary determinant of the size of the shuttle's payload bay the width was the ability to launch space station modules
professor young may be able to comment
if i understand it right the kind of human factor studies at the time said that people would be unwilling to live in tubes less than fourteen feet across for long durations
and so the shuttle had to be able to accommodate a fourteen foot wide module
the length could be adjusted
but the military payloads i think hubble pointed down rather than pointed up
i think there's been enough discussion of it that i'm not revealing classified material
the reconnaissance equivalent of hubble was the next generation reconnaissance satellite
and that was basically fifty five feet long
and so the decision was that you needed a payload bay sixty feet long in order to capture many military and reconnaissance payloads
and that was a determinant of the size of the payload bay which again drove the size of the shuttle
the other military requirement was the desire well there were two
one was a desire to be able to go into polar orbit which meant a west coast launch site
you cannot launch into polar orbit from cape canaveral air force station or kennedy space center without flying over boston
actually i guess you'd launch south flying over miami and cuba which for range safety is not a great idea
if you launch from vandenberg air force base out in california you've got several thousands of miles of open ocean in front of you
the air force was in a nice position here because it could make up any requirements it wanted
we've actually talked about the cross range
ok you've talked about it
that's where the cross range came from
and so you've talked about cross range leading to delta wings leading to heavier orbiter because of more thermal protection but all of that came from the requirement of getting the department of defense to say they would use the shuttle as a way of justifying to the economists the large upfront investment
have you looked at anything like this
this is kind of from the outcome of the phase a studies in the last sixty s and early seventy s
as you see phase b proposals a bunch of studies
and then in june of one thousand nine hundred seventy one a rapid shift so that in six months the configuration evolved to what was finally built
and i presume if you've talked about cross range and that sort of thing you've talked about the difference between the preferred shuttle of johnson space center and its chief designer max faget which was a straight wing minimal cross range shuttle probably technically simpler to build and less expensive to build into a delta wing configuration that matched the air force cross range requirement
what happened in june of one thousand nine hundred seventy one was critical to this whole process
at this point in its studies nasa had concluded to build a two stage fully reusable shuttle that would match the cross range requirement and the big enough to launch space station modules it would cost in the order of dollars ten billion to dollars fourteen billion in investment cost with a peaks funding of dollars two billion a year during the seventy s
omb in may of one thousand nine hundred seventy one said that's fine but you can only have dollars five billion with a peak spending of dollars one billion a year
if you want a shuttle at all it has to fit within that budget curve
and i presume aaron and others are going to talk about the kind of hectic trades that got from a fully reusable shuttle to first moving the liquid hydrogen tanks outside the orbiter air frame and throwing them away
then coming up with the idea that you could put both the external oxygen and hydrogen fuel tanks on the outside and throw them away to the notion that you could use strap on solids to assist in takeoff and move the orbiter down to the bottom so its engines could be used as part of the take off thrust to the final configuration
at that point june to december one thousand nine hundred seventy one there were not zillions but hundreds of different variations of shuttle design being floated around and other designs to do something that was approximating but not totally what's the right word i want to say
totally meeting all of the payload requirements that had been laid out
i'm sure you're going to be talking a lot about the engineering choices that were involved in this
and i'm not capable of talking about them
but as apprentice young system engineers the notion that you could go from here totally different concepts to here in six months and know what you're doing should make you a little nervous
why was the shuttle ultimately approved
omb the office of management and budget was on one spectrum of the participants in this debate
it really didn't believe its staff in the value of human spaceflight
its staff was and is the guardian of the federal budget believed it was under the policy guidance of the nixon administration to cut federal expenditures dramatically across the board
and so omb through this whole process through a variety of interventions and changing demands on nasa and political interventions getting leaked information from the aerospace industry and asking nasa nasty questions that it didn't want to answer the career staff of omb they say in retrospect went too far in trying to kill the shuttle
so they were at one end of the spectrum
nasa was at the other end obviously because by now one thousand nine hundred seventy one the shuttle was a survival project for nasa as it viewed itself as a large organization built around human spaceflight and developing new large scale systems
yeah larry
omb not congress is what i'm talking about
well ask your question
well the fact that non elected staffers i was thinking of congressional staffers
yeah but omb is the same thing
have enormous influence over not only implementing but making policy
and they stay long after their term
any of you heard of paul shawcross
i wouldn't think so
paul is an mit graduate
he's the examiner for human spaceflight in omb right now
he did a tpp masters up here ten years ago or so
and he is leading the fight to ground the shuttle
now nobody knows his name unless you're inside the beltway
one of the things i'll say larry in reaction to where you were going is at least the career staff on the hill are relatively accessible
so if you're an aerospace industry operative you know who they are and you can talk to them
particularly back in this period thirty five years ago the omb staff operated under a cloak of anonymity weren't open to talking to industry people
it's changed a lot over the years
and were able to operate behind a wall of secrecy and push their agenda into national policy
it is my belief after starting my forty th year in washington
god that's a long time
most people outside of washington think that congress matters but almost all the decisions that matter are made in the executive branch and congress just snips at the margins two percents or three percents
yes sir
how much did industry lobbying affect the design of the shuttle
i mean you look at it and every aerospace company had a piece of the shuttle you know they were getting money from it
i assume they also were probably lobbying their senators for places like i mean how much did industry
well if you look at this all of industry had study contracts
this is grumman which was a separate company at the time that had built the lunar lander
and boeing before it bought rockwell this was north american rockwell that had built the apollo command module
this was mcdonnell douglas
so the major aerospace companies each had a concept
and they were lobbying or contending for the adoption of their concept rather than what you see now which is work shares of a single concept
but this was a decision totally inside the executive branch at this point
congress was more or less supportive with the exception of one senator fritz mondale
walter mondale who kept asking some difficult questions
and nasa had its preferred concept
msc is manned space craft center what's now johnson space center
and it was grumman and mcdonnell douglas that came up with the idea of putting rockets on the side at that point they weren't necessarily solid rockets to enable a cheaper configuration
what you ended up with was the preferred orbiter of the manned space craft center and the nasa orbiter after all these design requirements
with the grumman mcdonnell douglas concept of an expendable external tank and recoverable strap ons
i don't want to say solids
what came out of this was an amalgamation of everybody's ideas
and i said in passing i will say again one of these industry firms and all evidence points to north american had a relationship with the omb that was feeding omb questions that would embarrass their competitors
or result in not doing the shuttle at all and continuing on with the existing systems where north american was building at least the apollo command module
players in this included the economic analysis
here is a report that was given as this debate heated up to nasa in october of one thousand nine hundred seventy one done by a company called mathematica which was founded by oscar morgenstern an economist at the institute for advanced studies in princeton
and his young colleague klaus heiss was and is an austrian somewhat crazy economist
again that may be the same thing crazy and economist
and they had the contract to do the external economic analysis for the shuttle
and they came up through their analysis with the conclusion that a reusable system is economically feasible at the current level of activity
and that a thrust assisted that's the strap ons shuttle is the economically preferred choice
this is economists designing technical systems another thing that would make me nervous
and this goes back to your comment earlier the demand for space transportation by nasa
the department of defense but particularly by commercial and other users is the basis for economic justification
the economic analysis had as an input a demand model that was totally unconstrained
it's everybody's wish list of things that might be launched but weren't funded for the next fifteen years
and that's where the next round of shuttle launches fifty or sixty which was part of the image at the time the decision was made came from this demand model which was done by the aerospace corporation given to mathematica to play with in its economic analysis
it's not clear how influential this set of recommendations was in the final decision to proceed
klaus heiss who is still very active claims it was very influential
i tend to think well you'll see my explanation why the shuttle was chosen
these are the kind of economic comparisons that were talked about
the launch vehicle investment costs nonrecurrent were clearly much greater for the new shuttle system but the recurring costs of operations were much less than using the current system
what is that
almost dollars six billion
this is five hundred fourteen space shuttle flights over a twelve year or eleven year period
eleven i guess
that is what about forty eight or forty nine flights a year the model that was being used at this time
it always interests me when people do modeling like that
you notice they chose the number five hundred fourteen not five hundred thirteen or five hundred fifteen
i mean it sort of gives you the impression that they know what they're talking about
if they had just put approximately five hundred that's really as much as anybody knew at the time
but that's the number that will make it work i suppose
now that would be rigging the analysis wouldn't it
look at how round the numbers are at the bottom too
well one of the things to watch here is that a lot of the costs were payload savings
there was this illusion at the time proven to be an illusion that because of the characteristics of the shuttle you could make the payloads much less expensive
you didn't have to design them to space program standards if you want
here are the payloads
instead of costing dollars eighteen billion over this period we're going to cost dollars twelve billion
that's a dollars six billion savings in payload
and it's that combination of operation cost and payload savings that give you the dollars seven billion advantage in the economic argument for going ahead with the shuttle
bush forty one later used the term which i think is properly applied to this analysis calling it voodoo economics
and i think most of the people involved in this decision recognize that
in a technical decision the white house often at this period in time depended on its office of science and technology now called ostp office of science and technology policy and its president science advisory committee called psac
what does psac mean
president council of advisors on science and technology
and so the science advisor who was actually an engineer not a scientist named ed david
commissioned a psac president science advisory committee study to look at nasa's proposals as a basis for the position he would take in white house debates
head chair of that study was alexander flax who was president of the institute for defense analyses a think tank in washington
and this was a kind of summary report that flax sent in about the panel
doubt that a viable shuttle program can be undertaken without a degree of national commitment over the long term analogous to that which sustained the apollo program
it may be attainable but is certainly not apparent at this time
this is a long letter and i'm just going to show you a couple of things
in retrospect i think this advice was sound advice that was provided
maintaining the program is large and risky with the long term prospect of fixed budget ceilings does not bode well for the future of the program
some decisions had been taken which introduce additional hazards to the success of the program technically operationally and economically in order to reduce projected peak year funding requirements
at that point i think the strap ons firing the main engines at liftoff
i can show you the analysis in the letter but i think that's what he was talking about
and basically what the psac panel recommended was postponing the decision for a year or more while some of the uncertainties were studied
general view
no significant role for manned spaceflight in military and civilian or science
didn't believe nasa's suggestion that the shuttle would allow experimenters to conduct their activities in spaceflight
evoke no enthusiasm from the scientists
you can counter that obviously
the shuttle was not a wonderful laboratory for most applications
the scientific community in large doubts the potential benefits of the space shuttle
manned spaceflight should be considered contributions in terms of national prestige international cooperation exploration and unforeseen future needs
basically the justification was really kind of arm waving intangibles some of which i think are very real like prestige and cooperation
science enthusiasm or lack of it because i think there was a clear division in the science community then between the real space scientist and which sort of came into its own with skylab when it was realized
but skylab was two years after this larry
but at this point the life science community was better that interesting things were going to be happening
but without any real data skylab was the first long duration exposure
and the life science community did not have the high step in the space science community at that point
space science was dominated by physicists
and in fact even within the nasa hierarchy
i think at that point it was still part of space medicine
right crew medicine
so yes that split was there
it must be noted that new approaches have often not been recognized or appreciated by the putative users until after they've been demonstrated
yeah mark
didn't hubble then conveniently make scientists excited about the shuttle
some
but again only after
we don't want to talk about why
we'll let hoffman talk about whether the tradeoff of putting hubble in the shuttle orbit compared to it being serviced was a good tradeoff compared to where you want a telescope
if you would have been designing this large space telescope in one thousand nine hundred seventy would you have made it shuttle launched
well everything had to be shuttle launched then
i mean given the history of hubble obviously had it been put in an inaccessible orbit we wouldn't have a space telescope now
so what can you say
again the shuttle cannot be justified on a purely economic basis for the unmanned portion of the program so it's a position directly opposite the thing i showed you before
it must be justified on the basis of new capability contribution to leadership and prestige its unique value if we're going to have intensity of infrequent manned spaceflight
and you have to postulate expanding rather than level space budgets over the next ten years
and the nixon administration said that wasn't going to happen
again the somewhat bottom line of the psac position led to the conclusion that if you had to make a choice in one thousand nine hundred seventy one you had two choices
either proceed with the shuttle program now or soon or drop manned spaceflight after skylab
and nobody likes binomial choices like that
but in the large degree that was the consideration or the mental set as this debate came to a head towards the end of one thousand nine hundred seventy one
actually that brings into sharp relief
remember the comment that professor cohen made when he was talking about what should a systems engineer do when presented with requirements that you're not really happy with and don't know if you can meet
but on the other hand recognizing as they came to that basically if they didn't build the shuttle that was being specified they probably were going to end up with nothing at all
and i think what john just showed was justification that that in fact was the political environment at the time
it wasn't the shuttle or something else
it was the shuttle or nothing
well except at the end people like psac and omb kept suggesting alternatives
this was a chart drawn in november of seventy one by george low who was the deputy nasa administrator and kind of the technical strength in this thing showing the investment costs versus this is in billions this is in millions the cost of operations for various things
the two stage fully reusable dollars ten billion investment low operating cost
the baseline fifteen point sixty foot payload bay could be done he's saying for dollars eight billion
within three weeks it was dollars five billion
a phase development develop a simpler one first and then a more complex orbiter later with the large payload bay and various rocket assists developing a smaller one smaller payload smaller bay or developing a titan three launched glider sort of thing
and the argument was in this curve it made sense to pick something along this line the knee and the curve on that basis
nasa made its last best case in a memo to the white house
this is dated november the twenty two nd
i think it shows up at the top
and look at these reasonings
this is really nasa's best case
number one the us has to stay in the human spaceflight business
that's not subject to analysis
that's a belief
and nasa argued that this should be a policy premise that the united states had to have humans in space
and the shuttle is the only meaningful new manned space program the operative word being new
you could have kept launching apollo capsules and saturn one bs or something
saturn five had been cancelled by then
the shuttle is a necessary next step for science applications military position in international competition and cooperation
the cost and complexity is one half of what it was six months ago
again as engineers that statement ought to be very nervous that in six months you can cut cost and complexity in half
and starting the shuttle now will have a significant positive effect in aerospace employment
not starting will be a serious blow to both the morale and health of the aerospace industry
let me talk about that last one
those i think were nasa's five best reasons for going ahead
employment impact was one of them
this is an undated memorandum from somebody within omb
peter flanagan was nixon's top person right at the intersection of policy and politics who was overseeing the space program
and flanagan had asked for impact of the shuttle on the aerospace industry
and this is what came back
what the program is
here is the additional employment impact on the engine program space shuttle
main engine
not very much in early seventy
this is seventy one
but in seventy two fairly significant employment impacts in either california or florida
and on the airframe
depending on when the decision was made to go ahead with the shuttle the impact in seventy two not very big but big enough
peak of seventy thousand jobs might ultimately result
the number of actual jobs by the end of one thousand nine hundred seventy two would be relatively small
why do you think one thousand nine hundred seventy two
you have to recreate the environment of the time
this was one thousand nine hundred seventy one
the supersonic transport had been cancelled
defense spending on vietnam was ramping down
nasa had no new program
and in doing the article that jeff mentioned on the space shuttle decision i ended up one afternoon in of all places santa fe new mexico talking to john ehrlich one of nixon's top guys
he said they sat down in the white house and mapped nasa jobs on key election states and said if we want to win the one thousand nine hundred seventy two election again this is political history well before your time
at that point the leading candidate was ed muskie of maine who was viewed as a serious candidate
it wasn't george mcgovern who was for better or for worse not a serious opponent
so that the political people were worried about winning places like california and florida and saw in the shuttle program a way of providing the indication of future jobs in key electoral states
some of the people i have talked to over the years say that at least for the top political levels of the white house that was the major reason for going ahead with this program
was in order to have aerospace employment impacts for the seventy two election
you can judge whether that's a good reason or not
the decision kept getting postponed until very late in the budget process
omb kept asking for more studies
this was a letter to the deputy director of omb caspar weinberger later secretary of defense which nasa said we've concluded the full capability still represents a best buy
but in recognition of budget problems we are recommending a smaller vehicle fourteen point forty five
because that is the smallest that will still be useful for manned spaceflight reid space station
it won't accommodate many dod payloads and some planetary payloads
and here are the numbers
i don't know whether you've seen these numbers yet
attached to this letter this is what nasa was telling the white house last business day of one thousand nine hundred seventy one what the cost of various shuttle configurations would be
you notice very little difference in the development cost of the configurations eight tenths of a billion dollars between a very small and less capable and the full size fully capable
and the operating cost relatively low across the board
look at that number dollars seven point seven million a flight for a payload cost of dollars one hundred eighteen a pound
i think one of the points of your course if i understand it is to understand maybe where these numbers came from and where they ever possible
i shouldn't bias the answer
were they ever a possible realization
i mean here are the heads of the leading technical organization in the us government presenting these figures to the white house
did nasa lose its technical integrity in this process was there any foundation for these numbers or where these total salesmanship are all i think valid questions
you said you took a two minute stretch break
yeah
let's do that and then i'll come back with the answer of why they ultimately went ahead with the shuttle
i'm going to argue that the decision to go ahead with the shuttle was made before all of this last six months or so of one thousand nine hundred seventy one back and forth when it occurred
and the basis for that is primarily this memorandum written through the director of the omb george shultz by cap weinberger to the president in which he is talking about the staff proposals for reducing the nasa budget which included eliminating the last two apollo flights and eliminating manned spaceflight
and weinberger said in this memo to the president i believe this would be a mistake
the reason for reducing nasa is because we cut it because it's cutable not because it's not doing a thing
that the uncontrollable programs that offer no real hope for the future this is remember a republican administration are eating up the budget
we do need to reduce the budget but we need to do it on a reasonable basis
there is real merit in the future of nasa
and if you took nasa apart it would be very hard to put it back together again
and he says stopping apollo and not starting new programs would be confirming a belief
i fear is gaining credence at home and abroad
our best years are behind us
we are turning inward reducing our defense commitments involuntarily starting to give up our superpower status and our desire to maintain our world's superiority
america should be able to afford something besides increased welfare
notice the underlining
and this came back with a handwritten note i agree with cap
that's nixon
my view the decision was made with those four words
yeah
just out of ignorance who is weinberger
weinberger at that time was the number two person in the office of management and budget long time california associate of nixon became secretary of defense under reagan
who he is in a sense irrelevant except he was a political appointee and a trusted associate of the president
and basically he was telling nixon that the reason for continuing the space program was image
i mean again read those words because they're interesting words
not having the strongest space program would confirm our lack of desire to maintain our world's superiority
i should you this december the twenty nine th memorandum where nasa went to the white house and said we would recommend the full size orbiter usually but with tight budget will go with fourteen point forty five
that was a friday the twenty nine th of december or maybe earlier in the week
anyway over that new year's weekend seventy one seventy two somehow somewhere nixon and his inner circle decided to approve the shuttle and approve the full size shuttle
and they decided if we're going to approve it we might as well approve the one that nasa thinks is best
and there was a meeting scheduled between nasa leadership and the president in the san clemente on january the five th
this is written by george low
for a historian doctor low was wonderful
he dictated his notes every week on the events of the week and then backed it up with the documents
that's like a treasure load for somebody that's trying to write the history of this
met for forty minutes
here's what the president had to say
we should not hesitate to mention the military applications
routine operations
quick reaction times
solar power satellites
these kinds of things tend to happen more quickly than we expect
nuclear waste disposal
he liked the fact that ordinary people would be able to fly in the shuttle
preserve the skills of the people in the aerospace industry
in summary we do not know of the things the shuttle will be able to do
it will open up entirely new fields
did we think it was a good investment
we the top two leaders of nasa
it's not a dollars seven billion toy
but he indicated even if it were not a good investment we would have to do it anyway because spaceflight is here to stay
men are flying in space now and will continue to fly in space and we best be part of it which was essentially what weinberger had said six months earlier
and to me that link in doing research in this area i've talked with both weinberger and ehrlichman and others around that
it's that link of human spaceflight to national image of the united states plus the employment impacts in the seventy two election that were the fundamental reasons for going ahead with the shuttle
you may make a judgment that those aren't great reasons but there they were
finally the decision was made say january three rd we would develop a shuttle with the big shuttle
and the only major open issue was whether to use a liquid or solid strap on
and that was studied for three months
trade off between future benefits and earlier savings
liquid boosters have lower operating cost solid boosters have lower development cost
conclusions here are heavily dependent on the mission model
the basic concern was keeping within the development cost of the shuttle and somebody else worry later about operating costs
all of that argument led to a decision in favor of the solid booster
the rest of this is kind of irrelevant to that
basically with the omb acceptance of this letter and the choice of the solids the configuration was frozen
there were some things in it that i'm sure you'll talk about later
there was at that point it had abort capability on the solids
i'm not quite sure how that would have worked
and somewhere along the line and it's not clear to me at one point the shuttle was going to have jet engines so it could fly to a landing rather than glide to a landing
and those were taken out
and i think it was after this but i'm not sure
as i said at the start the technical requirements of the shuttle i want to say it a little differently
the reason for approving the shuttle had very little to do with the specific technical characteristics of the system
if my argument that the main reasons were national prestige national image aerospace employment rather than the actual performance characteristics of a particular configuration
as long as the shuttle could be developed within a dollars five billion a year peak funding profile and as long as the shuttle could do things for the department of defense that made it useful to both civilian and military users
those were the drivers of the shuttle decision
and the technology was derivative of that rather than the other way around
that presented challenges as i'm sure aaron cohen or jeff have talked about of developing thermal protection developing a main engine developing a vehicle that could operate in multiple flight regimes
but those were secondary to the policy decision that the country should go ahead with this capability
questions
comments
reactions
yes sir
one quick question
i saw in one of those earlier things you put out that it was around seventy one it talked about first flight was seventy seven and fully operational by seventy nine
it seems to me that you could really reduce things like heat cost and you could spread out your development cost if you just said we're not in a hurry let's do it right but let's take our time
because there wasn't the race anymore
i mean we had done the apollo
we had beaten the russians
and i was wondering what kind of time constraints played into this why they were trying to finish it by the late seventy s and why not say let's launch it mid eighty s
well it ties into the current situation rather nicely in the sense that there was then and i think is now a perception that an extended gap in us human spaceflight is not politically acceptable
and at that point at the end of seventy one the only human spaceflight missions on the books were three flights to the skylab space station in one thousand nine hundred seventy three
the thing that followed that the apollo soyuz test project had not yet been agreed on
that wasn't agreed until may of seventy two
there would have been from seventy three to whatever future date a gap in american's flying to space
and i think the general sense was that that was not acceptable
also you had a workforce issue of maintaining the workforce with something to do at johnson by then not yet johnson but manned spacecraft center marshall spaceflight center and kennedy
and so you needed a relatively rapid development program so that you didn't either disassemble the teams and have to reassemble them later
and the same for the capability inside the industry
this was a program that was paste within a budget ceiling to make full use of the space industrial base in a reasonable timeframe
and i think that's why i would say i mean the dates were set on the basis this is the earliest we can do it on this budget profile
yes sir
you said the decision to go for solids instead of liquids for the boosters was the development costs as opposed to the operating costs
and now in this new architecture the plan is to use the solid rocket booster
it's something like it's proven to be the most reliable launcher ever developed or something along those lines
it's true
you've launched two hundred twenty eight of them with one failure
i agree
but at the same time if the idea then if they went for solid they could sort of reduce development costs and sacrificing operating costs
is sticking with solids in the same configuration now kind of repeating the same possible mistake
well i don't know
first you seem to assume that going with solids in the first place was a mistake
that a liquid strap on solution would have been a better solution
i'm not necessarily assuming that
many have argued that
it's not really clear that the operating cost of a liquid booster would have been less
one of the big concerns was you have a liquid booster you've got a real rocket engine on it and what happens when that lands in the ocean
i mean there were real concerns about could you clean up and reuse a rocket engine once it's been exposed to salt water
and we don't know the answer to that
maybe it's the time to segue if we want to do this to a quick look at the new architecture as it was presented yesterday which is being driven heavily the choices are being driven by budget ceilings again
an interesting question mark is whether you would be making the same choices now if you weren't constrained by budget once again
i didn't mean to assume that the liquid would be better than solid
just the observation of the basis the decision was made on
what this is or at a certain level what it isn't is the briefing that is on the nasa website which is a ten page briefing
this is the twenty three page briefing
there is a clear set of top level requirements in this new vision
and if you're space types at all you should know this
an interesting attempt to develop rationale for exploration which as you see is mainly intangible
curiosity and leadership they are very much the same things that started the shuttle program
this is about the only mention of mars in the whole presentation even though the president's vision says moon as a way of getting to mars
but here is why moon
and you're developing technologies that you're going to use downstream
and in particular this saturn five class
the apollo seventeen saturn five launcher took one hundred seventeen metric tons to low earth orbit
this vehicle that's being planned is slightly larger than saturn five
one of the few areas of technological innovation in this system is a new engine which uses liquid methane rather than liquid hydrogen as a fuel
why
maybe i'll ask the class why would you be interested in liquid methane
yeah
you could manufacture it on mars
yeah precisely
it's also a lot easier to store over the long term liquid hydrogen
but the main reason is it is a potential resource that you could get in situ on mars and so you wouldn't have to carry it all the way out there
and you could get oxygen on mars because there is clearly water
yeah
this may be slightly off topic but i wonder if you could comment on what you think the feasibility of
whether it's feasible or not we're not going to do it
elements of mars direct are in the nasa planning for mars which does a fair amount of in situ resource utilization
maybe i should back up and say what is this
mike griffin was sworn in as nasa administrator april the fourteen th
he had been convinced for a number of months that nasa's planning for implanting the bush vision was proceeding at much too slow a pace
and distributing money much too widely including to mit graduate students
jeff will explain that if none of you were affected by it
and so he ordered on april the twenty nine th a so called sixty day exploration architecture study to develop a specific architecture for getting humans onto the surface of the moon
and that architecture was basically finished by the end of july
and it's taken six weeks to get white house permission to release it
and so it was formally released yesterday
it was mainly because of two reasons because the senior people in the white house were on vacation in august as we all know
and so the omb staff could sit and snip at this and say well you can put all this stuff down but where is the money to carry it out
you have to show the business case that you can actually do this with the budget that is allocated
and it takes a little prestidigitation i think to do that
so this is what nasa has now said is its architecture for the next step in fulfilling our destiny as explorers
safe accelerated
accelerated in the sense that when griffin got there the schedule for the first crude flight of the cev crew exploration vehicle was two thousand fourteen and he wanted the shuttle hard date retired in two thousand ten
and he wanted to close that gap and thought that it might be possible to have the cev as early as two thousand eleven
it's turning out it is probably not going to happen
why is this just not apollo over again sending people back to the moon
here are the arguments
for all crew on the moon you can go anywhere on the moon not just in the equatorial regions
you can begin the buildup for permanent human presence in a lunar base
do institute resources
and it's more reliable and safer
the argument is that at least on ascent you get almost a factor of ten improvement in the safety
and how is that going to happen
well there are specific charts on that later
oh ok
although the system is being designed from getting to the moon backwards
it can also be used for the international space station if we continue with the space station
what are we going to do on the moon
learn to operate away from earth
do science
learn how to use local resources
develop one mission at a time
a lunar base
and develop techniques for the eventual human missions to mars
so there is another mars mention
science group picked a bunch of places that were interesting
i believe this was primarily a drill because going in nasa knew that its preferred site was the shackleton crater at the south pole of the moon
why
because of the possibility of water ice which would be a very valuable resource for in situ utilization
and each mission will go to the same place and begin to leave on the surface the elements of a long duration base
how is this going to be done
first you're going to have this heavy lifter launch the earth departure stage and the lunar lander
then you're going to have the smaller rocket launch the crew exploration vehicle
they are going to rendezvous in earth orbit
fire up the departure stage and head off to the moon
arrive in lunar orbit
and then the lander will separate and come down to the moon
this is the lunar orbit rendezvous method that was used for apollo plus an earth orbit rendezvous step
work on the moon
come back and rendezvous with the cev
probably ablative heat shield for what is hoped to be a land landing in western united states in oregon nevada or california so you don't have to deploy the fleet
the hope but it's what the contractors will confirm is that most of the cev will be able to reused up to ten times by replacing just the heat shield
again that's the hope
that is not put in as a requirement which is important
it's a desire
it's a desire yeah because they don't know they can do it
the baseline design is for a crew to the moon
the thing can actually carry six people either six people to space station early on or six people to a mars transit spaceship downstream
it can also be used if you take the crew accommodations out as either a pressurized cargo module going to space station and bringing stuff back from the space station
provides down mass capability which is missing after the shuttle goes away
the apollo capsule was three point nine meters across
this is five point five meters thirty two degree slope on the capsule
so it's a much larger capsule with hopefully better characteristics
nasa is calling the bluff of the commercial industry
it will issue shortly a request for a proposal with a half a billion dollars behind it that says you you the commercial sector demonstrate the ability to have cargo or maybe even crew deliver to the space station and we'll buy those services
we won't use cev
but in case you cannot demonstrate it the cev will be able to be a space station transport and crew rescue vehicle
i don't think anybody believes that in the relevant timeframe anybody in nasa believes in the relevant timeframe the private sector is going to develop crew transport to an acceptable level of reliability
maybe cargo
the national space transportation policy was issued last january that said that there should be full utilization of the evolved expendable launch vehicles delta four and atlas five
and that caused a problem because nasa said well for our purposes we're going to build something else
and part of the price of that is nasa agreement to use primarily delta four s and atlas five s for its robotic missions
the problem with that is those things are expensive a lot more expensive than the delta two s
and where does that leave people like elon musk in space exploration in privately developed launch systems
griffin was party to a study commissioned last year by the planetary society that came out with the conclusion that a shuttle derived launch system was the best way to approach this
this study examined that system shuttle derived and a number of possible alternatives and came up with this conclusion
this is the so called stick
the first stage is the current solid rocket booster on the shuttle for segment solid rocket
there's a new upper stage powered by some version one space shuttle main engine liquid hydrogen oxygen fuel
a capsule on top with a service module and an escape tower
now you can say why is it safer
it's because the crew is above any debris
and if something bad happens in the first couple minutes with a solid you've got an escape system to pull the crew away from it
and so nasa's probabilistic risk assessments say that this is a much safer system
you want to comment on that
well the probabilistic risk assessment i think it's fairly obvious if your escape system has a ninety percents probability of working then you have cut down whatever the reliability of the main rocket you've just increased your survival probability by a factor of ten if the rocket blows up
now if you listen to some of the stories that professor cohen has alluded to and we'll probably talk more about that there were some serious questions in apollo about how well the ejection rocket would work throughout the flight regime
and he said everybody always breathed a sigh of relief when the ejection rocket was jettison in the course of the launch
but nevertheless we've never used it in the us space program
but there was one example of a russian soyuz which they did have a pad abort and the crew was pulled off the pad by the ejection rocket
at a very high g load like fifteen gs or so but they survived and went on to fly again
you want to comment on the comparison of that to your level of confidence on return to launch site aborts on the shuttle
which was never done thank heavens
we'll actually talk about some of the abort schemes for the shuttle in more detail
and i think i'll leave it for that
but there's no question the only way to survive in the shuttle is for the shuttle itself to survive
we now have the capability either of returning the shuttle to the launch pad and landing or going across the ocean
but if you cannot quite get back for a landing we do now have the capability
i showed you the pictures of the escape
you can actually bail out of the shuttle now but it has to be under controlled flight
and there's definitely no system of just extracting you out of the shuttle
i mean the whole logic is this is claimed to be an order of magnitude safer for the crew on ascent
well i think the other point is that the solid booster by itself is more reliable
right now for the shuttle to have a safe launch you have to have both solid rocket boosters work plus all of the three main engines
so you've got a lot more failure points
this is a simpler system so only one solid booster
and then the second stage is your liquid rocket
so there are a lot fewer things to go wrong
plus the whole aerodynamics is much simpler because it's a simple stack formation
i think just from an aerospace design point of view it is a simpler and safer system
apparently there were some concerns because this was so tall of bending and that sort of thing
well that's something they'll have to deal with
but we've launched tall skinny rockets before
and i suspect they'll be able to figure out how to do that
the heavy lift is built around something derived from the space shuttle external tank with five versions of a throw away version of the space shuttle main engine plus two five segment solid rockets
so it's adding one more segment to the existing booster
the upper stage will be powered by one or two derivatives of the j two engine used for the upper stages of the saturn five
so this is a pretty retro system
but it was a good engine
and the other thing to mention some people had suggested using five segment solids for the crew launch vehicle
one of the other things when you talk about reliability as john said we've had now two hundred twenty eight launches of the solid rocket boosters
and one of the great things about the recovery is not just the economic impact of being able to recover and reuse the solid booster but you get to examine how it performed
and that makes a huge difference in terms of flying safely
because if you look back at the history of the challenger accident we knew for many years that we had a problem with blow by around the o ring seal
unfortunately for various reasons management chose to ignore that and fly anyway
but if you can recover your rocket after you use it and actually see how it performed and look and see if there are any critical failures which are suggesting that there are problems that also improves your reliability
so we have a lot of experience with four segment solid rocket boosters
and by choosing not to use this new and improved five segment booster for the human launches we're basically saying we're going to go with what we have experience with and what we understand
well besides that we don't have it now
it will be developed but when we develop it and use it for this some day after we get a lot of experience with it we may decide to well it says can be certified for now this is the heavy lift thing
right but you're going to want to fly it many times before we decide to and the intent is not to human rate this from the start
without the upper stage you can get one hundred tons one hundred six tons to low earth orbit just with the first stage and fifty five metric tons to well you can read i think
that's a new development obviously
this is marsha ivins who presented this yesterday one of jeff's former colleagues
this really isn't what it's going to look like the lunar lander
what's interesting is in addition to carrying the crew down the idea is that you can carry a fairly significant cargo load down to the lunar surface and leave it there
and that enables the fairly early buildup of a lunar base capability
and again this ascent stage will use a liquid methane propulsion
any sense of scale on the habitat
well this is enough for four people so it's not super big
i've seen dimensions on it but this is just a nominal design anyway
this design with all the tanks down here is not very good for carrying cargo down
they added the cargo capability and didn't change the picture
here is what nasa says are the commercial opportunities in this initiative
it's interesting
there were some other ones that have gone away from earlier briefings
here are the international opportunities
and they are focused in the longer run on lunar surface systems
and the reality is that without international contributions you cannot do a lunar base because on the budget available you cannot afford to build this stuff
i am looking at this hard for the first time
i saw a version of this in july and there have been some significant changes
the july version said opportunities for non us astronauts going to the moon and it's not here in this final briefing
committed long term lunar effort is needed
you can show mars up here but this is really a plan for getting back to the moon
and to reach for mars we must first reach for the moon
a griffin quote mike and i have talked about this he believes that the spread of the human species into the solar system is inevitable and the united states should lead so we carry the principles and values of western philosophy and culture
you can make a judgment whether you think that's a good rationale for doing this or not but he means it
great nations do great and ambitious things
we must continue to be great
cue the music now
this is interesting
this was a presentation that was given yesterday
and it is different than the presentation that was presented to industry yesterday
and the biggest difference is the industry presentation had a budget
and the budget shows that within the next five years all of this fits within the plan budget curve and then stops in terms of the affordability downstream
and it also shows no mars research and technology until fiscal one thousand nine hundred seventeen
and a fairly big wedge for lunar outpost
this is a us only scenario
any relief from this is going to come from international contributions
and one of the things that changed over the past week or so is now the phrase is go as you can pay
in the trade between performance requirements cost and schedule what you're going to trade is schedule
and nasa is very nervous of announcing this thing in the middle of the katrina recovery saying we're going to spend dollars one hundred billion going back to the moon
actually that was the first question that griffin got at the press conference
right
i talked with some media yesterday and this is the same sort of thing
it's interesting that the budget chart is not in the presentation i was given
the budget said that you cannot do it
the budget says that they can get started
what the budget is going to support and the hardware that we will be building over the next few years it's just the crew exploration vehicle
and the launch vehicle
the upper stage in the launch vehicle
right this
we will retire the shuttle
we will use that to support the space station if we're doing the space station at that point
and not until the shuttle is retired will then the money that is now used to support shuttle flights can start going into building this
that's the way i understand it
and that's the schedule which means you cannot get to the moon until near the end of the next decade two thousand eighteen is the target date
and that doesn't support any extra equipment once you get to the surface of the moon
so we don't have a long term habitat we don't have rovers we don't have nc two resources
all the stuff that we'd like to do on the moon that's over and above this
i think that's fair to say isn't it
i think it's fair to say except that as i say in this budget curve it's in the budget
but the only way to do the rest of it is to get that green part the lunar base buildup to be paid for by somebody else
so we will see
this is your future i think
if you're going into aerospace engineering this is at least the nasa project for the next fifteen years
and maybe twenty years from now there will be a class here talking about the systems engineering of the lunar exploration program
so you're kids can attend that class
then it was typewritten memos
now it's powerpoint
for you engineering junkies there is a thousand page report coming next month that has all the information of the trade studies and everything underpinning all this
this is the output of a study
the study report is coming
ok just briefly from most of you i've gotten an indication of what you want to do for your projects
i'll have a look at those
if you haven't sent them to me please make sure i get them by thursday
one or two of you have said you want to come and talk with me about it that's fine
let's see that's on the reports
the last thing just to remind you is this really is the last of the kind of introductory policy how did the shuttle program get started
for the next six weeks or so we'll be going deep into the nitty gritty of some of the systems
ok
good morning everyone
as i mentioned at the last lecture we're now moving into the nitty gritty of the subsystems
and we have quite an extraordinary list of speakers who actually worked on the original design of these systems
and as professor cohen mentioned not only did they design these systems for the shuttle but in most cases they came from having designed essentially the same systems on the apollo program
so in the question and answer period if there are some things that you'd like to know about the comparison of apollo and shuttle and also any questions about the future since some of you will be writing up possibilities for future development of some of these systems please ask the questions
and i spoke with tom moser and he's fully prepared to handle questions during the talk
because there will be a lot of fairly detailed technical stuff so if there's something that you're not familiar with you don't understand or just have questions about please ask while the lecture is going on
i want to remind you we have fairly extensive bios for all the speakers
rather than take the time in class to read through this i've posted them all on the class website
so my suggestion is go to the class website before each class and just see the background of the lecture
professor cohen is going to make some personal remarks about well whatever it is that you want to say about our speaker
before we go into that two things
tom moser asked me if we had this book
this actually is my personal copy
i'm going to put it on reserve
we may actually have it in the library as well
i'll check and i'll make sure that this gets on reserve
this really is a rather complete book
a lot the material that you've seen the early design of the shuttle is in here discussions of subsystems and then detailed discussions of the individual flights all the way up through the first hundred shuttle flights
it's a very nice resource and we'll have it on reserve in the library
the next thing
i believe i have now indications from everybody about what you want to do your paper on
we have two groups doing gn and c
one group doing displays and controls
we had two small groups interested in the propulsion system
and i've asked brian and other people you've gotten together
ok
only one person dan i think indicated an interest in the thermal protection system
i know we've got a lot people on gn and c
one of you i think had actually indicated an interest in thermal protection
i will leave that up to you
if somebody would like to work on thermal protection with dan he's back there and is available i guess
we have one group which is going to do a little bit of a different sort of project on modularity and some of the design methods that went into the shuttle compared to modern techniques that are available now so we'll be interested in seeing what you'll come up with
and then we had a group that wants to look at the propulsion system but from the point of view of fuel storage and what the system would have looked like if we had possibly used alternate fuels
we've got a nice spectrum of things that people will look at
any time you'd like to come and talk with me with professor cohen or take advantage of one of the speakers who happens to be talking about the area that you're interested in please do that
we do have time usually after class if you're free
the speakers will generally be available so take advantage of it
ok
that's enough talking from me
aaron i'll give this to you
i just have a few personal comments about mister moser
he is going to talk to you today lecture you today about the structures on the space shuttle
but tom as jeff mentioned did the same work on the apollo program
i was the manager of the command and service module on apollo and on the space shuttle orbiter so tom and i have been working tighter for many years
and i relied very very heavily on tom throughout the years
i told a little anecdote the other day and just let me say it again because the person that helped me with it is tom moser
during one of the shuttle missions we were getting ready to come back about eleven point zero at night i was getting ready to leave my house to go to the control center which i live about ten minutes away and we were getting ready to make the de orbit burn i got a call from rockwell international their head of the program there
and he said aaron we just did this test
we took the panel of tiles and dumped it into a bucket of waterproofing agent and all the tiles came off
i said what do you want me to do with that information
i said they're getting ready to come back and there's not much i can do about that
you're telling me all the tiles are going to come off
he said no they're not because that's not really what we did on the shuttle
i said well why did you do that test
that's sort of a dumb test
i had a decision to make whether i'd call the people in the control center like chris kraft and tell him we did this test and all the tiles are going to come off
but we've got to come back
i decided what i would do is call my good colleague tom moser
i said tom what should we do
we talked for a while and talked for a while and we decided to keep this information to ourselves until after the landing
it turns out it all worked out fine
there were no problems
but my point to you is that how much i relied on tom
the other point is you may find yourself in that type of situation some day on a project maybe not associated with that
tom turned out to be afterward my deputy manager in the orbiter project office
then he went on to become head of engineering at the johnson space center and then went on to be director of the space station in washington dc and now is a consultant
so with no further ado let me turn it over to tom
one thing i learned to do is have my own mic because aaron will keep it
one of the advantages to having a gray beard besides some of the folks in the back is i'm not going to refer to him as professor cohen or as professor hoffman
it's jeff and aaron
it's not out of disrespect
it's just the way i grew up so that's ok to do
when aaron asked me to do this and jeff i thought that's easy i'll just pull out some of my old notes and stuff like that and i will be up the next day
until jeff sent me the syllabus and what it was to do it made me start thinking about what i'd spent a good part of my life doing
and that was designing and development of the shuttle with aaron and some of the others but from a systems engineering perspective which you guys are doing
so what i did is i went back and looked at everything from a systems engineering point of view from one thousand nine hundred sixty eight all the way until eighty one when the shuttle flew
but i looked at it through the knothole of a structure and thermal person
so that's what i'm going to present to you today
and as you go through each phase of the program it changes
and sometimes it's down to the minute detail and other times it is the macro
that's my objective and i hope we accomplish that
ask me any questions any time that you want to
just a little bit of credit and recognition of some of the people that made this thing happen
you're going to hear from a lot of these people
you won't hear from john yardley or max faget because they are deceased now but these people up here made this program go
and then you will have also some references that give you a lot more detail than i'm going to give you today even though i'm going to cover a lot of it
there is one unique thing about a program like this that is complex
and that is the technical team and the management team have to work together and get together
everybody that is listed up there stayed on this program from day one and that is key
i don't think there has been a program since then that that has happened
and i think that if people judge the shuttle program as being successful i think that that's a major contribution to that success
beginning in sixty eight when the concept studies began all the way down to operations from a structural perspective what is important at each one of those phases in its weight and cost and produceability from day one
but then it gets into the certification phase the last part of the program how are you going to certify this thing
how are you going to prove that it's good for flight
how are you going to prove that the crew is safe
and you have to do it on the ground
so it's a completely different knothole you're looking through and a completely different set of parameters
i didn't start on apollo at the beginning like aaron did
i came out a little bit later
but in this program i had the good fortune of working on it from sketchpad to launch pad
and that's the way i characterized it
and aaron didn't know this but at the end i would have worked for free to complete the program because i was going to see something from beginning to end
and so if you ever had that opportunity to get on the program at the very beginning
i don't care what knothole you're looking at it through stay on that program if you can because it's a completely different life at every step along the way
so from the knothole of orbiter structure i'm going to break this thing into two pieces
orbiter structure and the thermal protection system
on the concept studies that began in sixty eight what was the objective of those concept studies
conceiving characterizing and characterizing by qualitative and quantitative concepts that would appear to work
so it was determining really the feasibility of the concepts
when that began the only requirement in the shuttle program was to have a reusable space transportation system
get something that goes from earth to low earth orbit and back reliably and reusable
there wasn't a requirement on payload size there wasn't a requirement on number of missions there wasn't a requirement on any of those things
that's what it was
the variables that we all looked at though were budgets yearly budgets developments costs operations cost
and you'll see as you go through some of this stuff and probably some of the stuff that dale myers showed you is development cost you can spend a lot of money on development and reduce the operations cost or you can spend a little bit of money on development and have very high operational cost
so there's a trade there
and when you're dealing with budgets that you really don't understand exactly what they are that's a very important variable
payload mass and size is important from a structural and thermal standpoint because it has to do with mass and it has to do with energy that has to be dissipated during reentry
the operational orbit is important
fully reusable flight systems or partially reusable and that's a trade on cost and weight
turnaround time and cross range
cross range was critical to us at this point because nasa didn't have a requirement for cross range
and that's cross range after you come back into the atmosphere to be able to deviate your normal ballistic trajectory coming back in
but the air force thought that they had a requirement so we had to include that
and then as we got into the next phase of it looking at what was important from a structural standpoint is the efficiency of the load path the weight the payload size the aerodynamic surface loading now we're beginning to get in and look at what are the wing loads et cetera and how does that manifest itself in weight and produceability
we did that under two years of contracted effort
then within jsc the johnson space center which was formally the manned space craft center we conceptionally looked at designs in house
and we looked at fifty three different designs
you talk about a systems engineering thing what we did was got a group of people about the size of this room and went away and locked ourselves up
but we had expertise in every area propulsion guidance and control aerodynamics aero heating that kind of stuff
and we were almost doing a configuration a week when we did that
so when you look at fifty three different configurations over basically a two year period we were not only just looking at it but we were quantifying then what it meant in terms of all the parameters that i showed you a while ago
how much did it cost
what was the development cost
what was the operations cost
what was the weight
what was the maximum temperature as we saw on the vehicle
was there a thermal protection system that could accommodate those types of temperatures
that was the characterization in the systems engineering parameters that we used
tom where these designs kind of refined
were you refining with each iteration or was it like we'll try this for a couple iterations and then maybe try something completely different
were you working towards a final
well what we were doing was looking at the variables
in other words like here when we looked at fifty three different things we looked at payloads ranging anywhere from fifteen thousand to forty thousand pounds
we didn't know what the answer was going to be
the driving thing there was reusability and cost profile
we thought we knew what we could afford to do
we looked at payloads from eight feet in diameter to fifteen feet in diameter thirty feet long to seventy five feet long
we were looking at all of those things
and as we did that we changed configuration from a straight wing which is not good for cross range to a delta wing which is better for a cross range to a double delta wing which is even more structurally efficient
landing weights then was important
just like everybody saw the plane landing last night it had to get that landing weight down to where it could control it
well that was the same thing we were doing
we were looking at landing weights not only from a controllability but also from a produceability
we looked at weights from seventy thousand to two hundred fifteen thousand pounds boosters from fully reusable to partially reusable propulsion systems and various types of things
we even looked at air breathers so that they didn't have to come back a dead stick like they do now when jeff was in the vehicle
and pressure fed and pump fed systems
there was simplicity and complications in all of them
tankage internal or external to the orbiter
could you maybe say for people's benefit here who have grown up in the computer age something about the tools that you had
i am going to do that in a minute
you are ok
i'm going to give you a challenge too
so we looked at all of those
and we not only looked at it we quantified it to the extent that we could get the first order estimates on what the cost in all those things where
now then i chose a couple of them here
this was one of the early designs of the orbiter
look where the locks and hydrogen are
it's inside the orbiter
it has a straight wing so it was fairly lightweight except for having to carry all that tankage
the engines were on the orbiter itself but the payload was really small
very low cross range very low payload
so that was probably the eight foot diameter forty thousand pound payload
we evolved that over a series of studies until we finally got down to about february of seventy two where we said we're going to have to have a larger payload than this
and the cost profile didn't fit
what we did is we came up with a configuration that's almost like the shuttle that you see today
large payload all the propulsion systems the main propulsion systems are outside the orbiter
and it's a fly back and part of it was throwaway
in this case we had a booster in line with the external tank rather than in parallel with it like the srbs are today
basically that's what we started the detailed design and development with but not exactly
and i'll show you that
now then some of us who like to worry about load pass and simplicity and low weight of the structure we said ah ha
what we will do is put the engines on the external tank
all the mass is down here
very little mass up here
and for boost reduce the weight of the orbiter which is going to reduce development and operations costs a whole bunch and thermal protection system but we have to swing these engines for reusability from the external tank back up the orbiter and stow them for entry
well our brother in mechanical engineers they beat us pretty hard
they beat us black and blue
anyway that was a concept that we looked at very late in the program
and that didn't go anywhere even though max faget and i wanted to do it pretty badly
as we continue now
now we're four years into the thing we've done all these systems engineering analysis so we end up with a final concept
here's what we want
we want a two point five stage launch vehicle because it costs too much basically to fly back the booster
we just didn't have the money so we said we want to have the most important part be fully reusable so that was the orbiter
it was going to be a delta wing
we figured that the mission life we had a mission model of five hundred total missions one hundred missions per vehicle and there were five vehicles
we had an ascent acceleration of three g's
why was that
really the requirement was to keep down the inertia loads but it was also to let people off the street flying the thing
go ahead
what constitutes half a stage
half a stage means that the external tank is like a half a stage
the srb is a stage the engine the orbiter is a stage but the tank is a half a stage
we kept the max dynamic pressure down because that was a major driver for control systems and for aerodynamic services
you would love not to have the wings on the orbiter going uphill
that's a penalty that you pay
so one of the things to help reduce that is to keep that aerodynamic load down on the wings
then for atmospheric flights and i'm going to talk a little bit more about that we said this thing is going to come back like an airplane
let's fly it
let's design it like an airplane two point five g normal maneuver load factor and a negative one g
a crew of four for one week
that becomes kind of important because that sized the crew module that sized a lot of the environmental control systems you'll hear about later and other things in the life support systems
so without a lot of changes to show you what the flexibility and capability of this vehicle is the orbiter is now flying seven people for two weeks
so it went from twenty eight man days to sixty three man days basically
and i don't think a lot of people understand what that has done
and there is a lot more robustness in the orbiter in the shuttle system that was not designed into it but had some inherent capability
and also some of it was a little bit of forethought in the thing
here comes the air force stuff sixty five thousand pounds up forty thousand pounds return
that was the requirements fifteen point sixty
another important thing is we didn't know what they'd be but maybe up to five payloads at a time
and that's going to become a problem i'll show you about in a minute as we start peeling this systems engineering onion of getting down into the details
and deployable payloads
cross range
a little less than one thousand three hundred nautical miles cross range
tps material
we didn't know what the hell it was going to be but that's what we started with
so we began the contract for design development test and evaluation
nasa does pretty good stuff in house
and i think with doctor mike griffin at the helm now you're going to see a lot more of that coming into nasa where they're doing a lot of stuff in house
but when it gets down to doing the detail design and manufacturing and cost control
down to the detailed parts and manifesting everything around that's where the contract is
nasa doesn't have that capability in a large program
so this is where we gave a contract to rockwell international
they had the integration contract
and another company martin had the external tank
had the srbs
and who else am i missing
and rockwell had the integration and orbiter contract both
this is what they started with
that was their authority to proceed configuration even though this is shown as in one thousand nine hundred seventy two
but you see there is very little difference in the configuration then and what the configuration is today
there was some minor mods which are not worthy of even talking about right now
but let me give aaron a lot of credit
his favorite word the whole time he was the project manager was no
and he had above his blackboard better is the enemy of good
we've got something
we know it will work
we knew that damn configuration would work
and aaron got inundated with people coming back after we started the program
aaron if you put reaction control jets out on the wing tips and here and up on the vertical stabilizer you get a lot more control authority
and when you guys start looking at this guidance and control stuff in propulsion you're going to come up with that
but it complicated the entry in the thermal protection system
it complicated getting the fuel to those things so aaron said no no no
and the astronauts would come in
they'll always meet with aaron at seven point zero in the morning because that's when they would get their word in
and so they would have to go do flight training or something like that
and as they walked out the door aaron would say no
they didn't hear him but it was always no
and that was critical in this thing
and so the program came in at dollars five point one billion
it started dollars five point one billion
it came in at dollars five point one billion
it was only because of being able to say no
but to say no you better do a good systems engineering job at the beginning
and were there some faults and errors
yeah
i'll confess and open my kimono here on the few of the things but all in all it wasn't too bad
and i will say one other thing about systems engineering
it was interesting to watch four or five different large companies look at the various concepts
i can say this now because none of these companies even exist in the form that they were then
grumman had a very large systems engineering organization
rockwell had a very small systems engineering organization almost down to one or two people but they were extremely good
they were extremely good systems engineers
nasa went with rockwell for a number of reasons but one of the things that probably benefited the program was having a very concentrated set of engineering requirements coming out of a systems engineer which almost turned out to be one guy ed smith
and he was very very good at that
the reason i bring that up to you the thing that's most defficient from my perspective now in the united states today are good systems engineers
very good thermal engineers good structural engineers good propulsion engineers
there are very few systems engineers that are good
if you make a note of that and become one of those you'd be highly sought after
so a little bit of this is a repeat
as we went into these requirements and from a government system's perspective now the challenge was to give the contractor the requirements that they need but don't over specify the requirements
we were very careful to say here are the top level requirements don't ask us what the internal loads on the wing are because we're not going to tell you what that is
that is for you to decide
and if you want to change something within these constraints you can change it
but the burden is on you to make everything else right
that is something that i think the orbiter did probably better than the external tank
i'll just say it like it is
go ahead
i'm just wondering sir what happened to the canard configuration with the delta wing
what happened to it
yeah
it was not selected
and i don't remember why it was not selected
what was driving it i don't know
i don't have those notes anymore
it could have been cross range
i don't remember that particular configuration if it had the required cross range for the payload mass
i just don't remember
i don't think it would have been cost
i think it was a lot of complexity
well it did have complexity so it had to add some cost
weight wise it probably was not too different just because of the control authority of having the canards there
but that's a good question
tom you might mention
i'm going to touch on that again a little bit in a minute about what we did in surveying and determining the loads
and let me hold that if i can
now we have begun with the design
when you use the term top level requirements what does the top level refer to as opposed to just requirements or performance requirements
well the top level requirement changes as the phase changes
the very beginning in sixty eight the top level requirement was a transportation system
we don't know what it's going to be reusable and we don't know how much payload it is going to have to carry
so that was the top level requirement
then it was to look at all of the combinations of things that you could create
the solution was it is feasible and we think that this is about what it's going to cost
now as we get into this point these are the top level requirements
so the granularity of the requirements increases as the program advances
good question
for the challenges now i'm going to call it the challenges of beginning this thing
we know what the configuration is you know what the design life is et cetera all that kind of stuff but we still haven't decided on what the material of the airframe is going to be
we estimated some stuff because it could be aluminum or it could be titanium and this is what it would be
and it all fits within the right cost and performance envelopes but let's optimize that from a systems standpoint a little bit and see what that is
some of the challenges in structural design and i'm going to talk about each one of these things that's listed on here separately should the cabin be an integral part of the fuselage or should it be a pressure vessel floating within the fuselage
trade to be made
how are we going to account for thermal stress in this
well what the hell is thermal stress
apollo we didn't care a whole lot about thermal stress
it really wasn't an issue not to the extent that a vehicle like this is
it was very sensitive for thermal stress
compartment venting
we'll talk more about that
major structure concept trades to reduce weight basically
and then how in the hell do we get the design loads on this thing
from a structural design criteria we said well let's start with one point five
that's what all airplanes are designed for so we'll do that
even though some of the boosters were designed for one point twenty five
does everybody know what an ultimate factor safety is
that's the allowable of the material that you've decided to use compared to the maximum expected load that you will ever want to see three sigma kind of loads
and then whatever the factor is about that that's the factor of safety
so you simply take the maximum loads you can expect to find multiply it by one point four and it better meet what the allowable is
if there's margin in that allowable then that's called a design margin
ideally you would like to have zero margin
that still gives you a forty percents factor of safety
everybody with me
yield is classically something that you decided on material
well i want to also have a factor safety on yield
and we sat around and asked ourselves why the hell do we care about that
the only thing you don't want it to do is you don't want it to deform such that it won't operate so doors won't open hinges won't work et cetera
we did not impose that on the program of the yield factor safety
we didn't on the orbiter
the external tank did
and they paid a weight for that because if you put a one point two factor safety on yield for some materials that gives you a lower allowable than an ultimate factor safety when you're really only interested in ultimate strength
and then we had said thermal stress is going to be important but we don't want to be so conservative that we let the thermal stress add in such a way that it adds conservatism
but at the same time we don't want it to count on it if it's relieving when we cannot really rely on it to be there
so it is decreasing from the stress point of view
a scatter factor of four on life for a hundred missions
what is scatter factor
scatter factor just means a factor of four
if you have ten thousand cycles at twenty thousand psi stress then you have to certify it for forty thousand cycles
typically most airplanes you fly around on they have a design life of about twenty thousand flight hours
i think that's about right
they are fatigue tested to eighty thousand flight hours to make sure that they have that kind of factor on life
and then we said well this thing is going to be used a lot we've never looked at that before so we will arbitrarily say we'll use a one point two factor at the end of life or ultimate
and then these are just classical engineering material allowables that everybody uses today
a lot of people have mentioned lately as we were thinking of the end of the life of the shuttle that although it was designed for a hundred missions i guess it was always assumed that those hundred missions would be flown over the course of just a few years
and so i think it's true you more concerned with the long term effects of stress than things like weathering or being exposed to salt air over twenty years
is that correct
well you hit a very key point
and you're exactly right
it turns out a hundred missions wasn't really designing anything
i mean it could have
well as a matter of fact it didn't
i don't know of anything
a hundred missions design is for a cyclic stress high cycle low stress fatigue or low cycle high stress
it didn't
but the environment sitting around or the life of the material exposed has
the leading edge turned out to be there is a degradation in the strength of the leading edge material the carbon carbon material because of being exposed to the conditions
there was some corrosion found in the wings during an inspection
nothing was wrong with the low carrying capability except it was beginning to corrode
you've got me mixed up with somebody else
i'm not talking about avionics
no but it's true
there i think just to bring that up the idea was they would not be good for that length of time so change them out we're going to have to upgrade them anyway
aaron i think just left being program manager when they decided to change no you still were there they decided to change the general purpose computers
it took ten years to change the general purpose computers because of all the certification
did the use and safety factors like what numbers you were using how much did the apollo program aircraft safety factors
the apollo program was like one point two factor of safety as i recall because it was a single use item
and i'm going to take the opportunity to go back and verify that but i think that's was right for some conditions
and it could have been one point five on others
i know on pressure alone it was one point five psi
you say well why was it different for pressure than it was for others
because there was some historical data there that nasa had that said that was the right thing to use
but that's a good question
now you've caught me
i can remember on the boosters it was one point twenty five but on the command module itself let me retract that it was probably one point five
it was one point twenty five on the boosters and one point five on the crude part of the vehicle
one of the challenges that we had here was to establish a criteria
these were our objectives
to assure that there was a realistic stress that we're putting in the vehicle and we weren't being overly conservative with it
we were not reducing the stress because of thermal gradients
and then we were incorporating the classical pressure induced stress
and now what were the details of that
here were the details
we came up with this algorithm that says we will use a factor of one point four on all external loads because that's aerodynamic loads inertia loads and so forth
we will use a factor of one point four on the thermally induced loads if you will
they are really thermally induced strains and stress
we'll use a one point four factor on that if it's additive to the mechanical but if it's subtractive we'll only use one because we probably won't reach the maximum thermal conditions so you cannot rely on that
on pressure we used one point four
unless it was pressure alone we used one point five
but the whole thing is we would never have less than one point four of the total combined load
so that's what we did
and so you say why in the hell did you do that
why did you have to go to that kind of detail
the reason being is because you probably had about thirty thousand stress engineers working on the program and they needed to know how to combine this stuff
if you didn't this guy is going to do one thing and this guy is going to do something different
we got it down to that level to save weight in the vehicle and save complexity in the vehicle
well we have our criteria set now
let me give one more story on marginal safety
one of the people that i showed you at the top of the credits list was john yardley
and probably aaron and larry young and other people would probably agree with this john yardley is probably the best engineer that i ever knew in my entire life
he's probably one of the best managers i ever knew
john yardley had the job of being the program manager on mcdonnell douglas f four aircraft
and he was an old stress guy
he knew that weight was going to be a critical parameter in the success of that program and he had to keep the weight out
what he did on that previous slide where i showed you the stress criteria and make sure that you have a zero margin of safety with a factor of one point four is he told all the stress engineers because they all worked for him design to a negative ten percents
which means if you really do your job right this thing is not going to be able to reach ultimate load
it's going to break
but he also knew that they were probably conservative because he was one of those guys
and he also had in his hip pocket if he's wrong he would find out because he had the opportunity to do an ultimate load test on the airframe
it turns out he did the ultimate load test it passed the ultimate load capability and he saved a bunch of weight in airplane which made it a very successful airplane
sometimes from a systems perspective it's what you learn in the details or in the trenches as you're coming up and being able to apply it the same way that aaron did a lot of stuff as he was managing the program
on the airframe we looked at a lot of different structural materials we looked at a lot of different tps materials and some of the parameters that were coming out in there was not only strength of the material but how much heat sink there was because you were having to rely on that to keep the weights down
and let me go up one slide and show you something here
i don't know if you can read that but on the left side what it was is it was all aluminum airframe
it had an ablator thermal protection system on it
and you said well i thought you said it was going to be fully reusable
well we also had a cost constraint
so we put that in there as a reference point
and that was the lowest cost
and here's weight up here
it wasn't quite the lowest weight it was pretty low but it still was violating the objectives and requirements that we had
and we said that will be our reference point
then we looked at different types of aluminum
we looked a beryllium
we looked at titanium
we looked at the thermal protection system on a beryllium substrate
every kind of combination you could think of
the interesting thing was look where the whites were staying
they were all staying within the sixty thousand to eighty thousand pound total weight envelope
what was happening is we were decreasing the thermal protection system thickness
if we were using titanium which we could operate to six hundred degrees the tps weight was going down
titanium was not as good a heat sink as aluminum even though we're working it to a higher temperature
and it turned out that the combination of tps plus structure was pretty much a constant
i'm oversimplifying it but that's basically what it was
and you can see where the cost was
this is beryllium titanium
the cost was way out of whack compared to everything else so we said we're not going to do that
and there were some other exotic materials over here for hot structures
we said let's now decide what this airframe material is going to be
it's going to either be aluminum or titanium
and total weight total cost doesn't make any difference they're about the same
we weren't' smart enough to decide so we went out to the skunk works
kelly johnson skunk works i don't know if you know what that means
kelly johnson designed and built more airplanes in a short period of time
and they were the ones larry was it in the fifty s the sr seventy one was designed the black bird
i think it was in the one thousand nine hundred fifty s
it was somewhere in there
they had to develop titanium for that airplane
it was a hot structure design
we went out and spent some time with kelly johnson
we went through all this stuff with him
all right mister johnson at the end of the day it's a mix for us
would you build it out of aluminum or titanium
he said aluminum
and the reason being is because titanium was so difficult to work to produce
the manufacturing was difficult
today it's a lot less difficult than it was then
we made the decision and went with aluminum so we had to protect that structure to three hundred fifty degrees
that was a lot of work and a lot of analysis to make that decision
and we talked to aaron and said that's what we want to do and he said go for it
the next thing we looked at we got the airframe design now we're starting to put together the fuselage
we said we can put this crew cabin as part of an integral part of the fuselage or we can make it a separate pressure vessel inside
went through the trades on this
and we came up with some of the discrete advantages
it's a purely simple pressure vessel when you don't have any inertia loads except the mass that is inside the crew module itself
there is a discrete attachment between the crew module and the forward fuselage which means you could start the design and construction of these two things in parallel
and simple interfaces are important
somebody mentioned modularity and it's probably modularity in some analytical tools
but simple interfaces where you're putting things together are extremely important
so this created a very simple interface for us
also we didn't have a lot of heat transfer to the crew module
it was easy to control the environment within the crew module
and we designed it out of a material a two thousand two hundred nineteen aluminum which had an inherent advantage of if it gets a crack the crack doesn't grow catastrophically under the operating stress before it starts leaking a lot
well that's good because from a crew safety standpoint you know that if the seals are working and it's still leaking you've got a crack in that pressure vessel but it's not going to be a crack that is going to propagate to be a catastrophic failure
we chose the floating design
when i talked a while ago about the crew of seven in two weeks now compared to four for seven days back in seventy two we said we don't know what the requirements are going to be but let's make this thing as robust as we can without penalizing ourselves weight wise
so we went back to apollo and said what were all the densities in the command module for the crew module
we figured out a density and a volume
we said that will be our baseline
that's what we came up with
well for another fifty pounds of weight we could increase the carrying capability of the crew module by about five hundred pounds
that was a good trade at that time so we did it
we just said we're going to design this thing
instead of for twenty five thousand pounds we'll design it for thirty thousand pounds of payload carrying capability within the crew module
it turned out to be a good decision
we weren't smart enough to know operationally we'll need larger crews for a longer period of time but that helped us out a lot
you probably also want to mention when you look at the structure of the crew cabin in both of the shuttle disasters the challenger and columbia we have every indication that the crew cabin actually survived the breakup of the orbiter
so it really was an excellent structure
i'm glad you brought that up
as a matter of fact i have a note here to bring it up myself
jeff is exactly right that that's what it did but it was never designed to be a crew escape module
it had some inherent capabilities probably could survive some things that it couldn't had it been part of the fuselage different flight regime so it had that inherent capability
but it was never designed and i know there was a lot of talk after challenger that it looked like it would have survived all the way but it would have never made it all the way
but it would have under a lot of conditions
we said apollo didn't have a lot of thermal stress issues but we know this vehicle now we've skinnied down weight wise as much as we can to the extent that the thermal gradients between any two different pieces of structure where they were different materials or different masses is going to cause a thermal gradient
and thermal gradient cause thermal stresses
and you will see in a minute that was not only important to stress but is important to all these tiles we were sticking on the outside of this thing
so we said we have to look at every one of these thermal gradients and we have to understand what that induced stress is because we had an indication it was going to probably contribute about thirty percents of the total stress in the vehicle
it was going to be from thermal stressors at different flight regimes
kelly johnson helped us out pretty well deciding on aluminum and titanium
we said why don't we just fix this thing
we'll design around all the thermal stress
we'll put stress relief in it like expansion joints along the sidewalk
we'll do all these kinds of cute things and we'll simplify the heck out of this
as a matter of fact the sr seventy one the black bird it had huge thermal stress problems
so the wing on an sr seventy one normally the skin carries a lot of the wing bending
not true on an sr seventy one
it's corrugated skin so it can expand and contract
all the wing bending is carried in the spar caps the frames that go out the entire wing and the caps themselves
they paid a penalty but avoided the thermal stress issue
we said we'll be smart with that
we'll go talk to the sr seventy one guys
and we'll go talk to the concorde
the concorde was an airplane that had high thermal stress even though it wasn't that high a temperature
i think it was reaching five hundred or six hundred degrees outside but it was moving fuel around all over the vehicle
so when it moved this high mass of fuel from one part of the vehicle to the other it was creating big thermal stresses
they knew what to do
they designed in stress relief at these high points
it bit them
every time they did it they had fatigue failures
every time they did that
they finally gave up and said just accommodate
we said we'll do that
now then we decided on that criteria
we're going to account for thermal stress but how can we do it
we don't have a three d model that we can apply mechanical loads to i'll call aero loads mechanical loads and temperature distribution
the finite element model didn't exist
we had a finite element model that had fifty thousand degrees of freedom but we didn't have a computing capability to combine thermal and mechanical loads on there at the same time to be able to decide how to size the structure
we said now we've got a problem
what the hell are we going to do about that
what we did is looked at what were the conditions causing the thermal stress
going uphill thermal stress is not an issue
it's all coming back in in the entry phase
we knew we had initial conditions that were going to primarily be the cause of it
coming back where the vehicle had been sitting in top sun for a long time bottom sun for a long time side sun for a long time so we looked at those initial conditions as being the worse
and we proved to ourselves that it was the worst
then what we cleverly did is we went around the vehicle where we had a detailed structural model of a lot of stuff
and we created a hundred different thermal models of different types of structure
this is one that was in the wing truss
we had a wing skin panel we had a truss member and a lower wing skin panel
and we did a detailed thermal analysis of these hundred models
we then applied that to a structural model simplified which was giving us the internal loads and stresses that we needed and then we hand extrapolated that over the entire vehicle
there was no other way to do it
so as you look at your analytical capability probably on your damn laptop now computing capability you couldn't really do it on that but think about that
and i noticed nobody wants to talk about structures as one of these groups
if one of you changes then i'm going to feel really good when i go back and fight the hurricane in texas
but that's the way we did that
it was a necessity that we had but we didn't have the capability so we invented a way to do it
and i'll show you in a minute it worked
another issue that we had
normally you'd like to just vent everything through one area in the vehicle but we couldn't do that because the payload bay had to be very clean
it had to be contamination free
and there was hydrogen in the backend of the vehicle
there was a pressure vessel in the front end and a bulkhead up there
we said what we've got to do is we have dictated to ourselves that we have to design a venting system
this turned out to be a major part of a lot of internal loads in the vehicle because of venting from one compartment to the other
and stop and think about it we had vents all along the fuselage
we had a different pressure coefficient at each one of these vents for our various attitudes during ascent for our various attitudes during entry so we now had a whole myriad of complicated internal pressures that we had to accommodate
but that was pretty straightforward
we just complicated our design with the venting system that we had but we had to do it to meet the requirement
i don't know that people are actually aware that there are all these vent doors because it's not something that you would normally pay attention to in the pictures
that's right you don't
as a matter of fact in this book that jeff referenced it shows where all the vent doors are
i didn't show that detail to you today
and they do open and close at different times during ascent and entry
venting just for carbon dioxide gases
no
when you start off you're at one atmosphere right
as you rapidly go uphill there's a delta p across internal bulkheads and internal compartments internal and outside the vehicle
and depending on what the flight regime is and where the shockwave is and where the vent door is it's changing the whole venting thing
that's a whole lecture in itself on what we did
the crew compartment is designed to have a delta pressure of one atmosphere but inside the payload bay that's not designed to be a pressurized environment
and so you need to be sure that the air can get out of the payload bay fast enough that you don't over pressurize for instance the payload bay doors or other parts of the structure
there were some other trades that we had to make
let me skip forward so you can better understand this
for reference purposes the main engines are here one point five million pounds of thrust coming into this part of the vehicle
there is a longeron that goes all the way along here
a big mass up here with a crew module
and the crew module i showed you had just discrete attachment points
all of the ascent inertia loads are reacted right here so all these loads go along this longeron
now all of a sudden we have a very good and efficient load path
the wing right here this is a primary load carrying member of the wing
that's a spar
and it ties into this big bulkhead which is right here
when jeff talks about the pressure differential don't forget this thing is fifteen feet in diameter here so you can imagine the total loads you have on that with a couple of psi delta p
it's big
that was a significant part of the driving stresses in that
another point i want to make about this is well i talked about simple interfaces between the crew module and the forward fuselage with bolted attachments
we had a simple interface between the wing and the mid fuselage
a simple interface between the mid fuselage and the aft fuselage
the same thing with the vertical stabilizer and aft fuselage and these orbital maneuvering propulsion system
that was important from a structural point of view to be able to modularize and analyze these things
but it was also important because four different contractors built all these parts so they had to have an interface that they could not only design and analyze to but that they could physically attach to
sometimes when you have just a sketch on a piece of paper you don't think about that
and it does cause a little bit of complexity sometimes in a program
the main thrust structure is carrying one point five million pounds of load from the engines
how do we design that
well we could have done a space frame or we could have done a truss configuration
we decided to go with the space frame or the truss rather than a plate girder the term i didn't use correctly
and with that we saved one thousand seven hundred pounds of weight in the vehicle
we used titanium
and this is a compression design
we thought we needed to get a little bit more weight out of this thing
what can we do to increase the compression modulus of titanium
we put boron epoxy scabbed it on the axial load members of the thrust structure and that's the way we got a lot of that weight out
that was a manufacturing problem i won't go into now of how you build this thrust structure but it works fine
the aft wing carried through excuse me
go ahead
i just had a quick question
sure
we heard earlier that there was a cg problem in that the cg was too far forward in the aft for a number a number of missions
i was wondering how that weight that they had to add to the cg compared to the weight that you guys saved
the weight of the payloads themselves you're saying that there was a problem if heavy weights were too far aft or too far forward
the orbiter
i guess the cg location was too far forward and they had to adjust it on certain missions by adding weight near the back
well what that is that is true and that's a problem
it's not a problem
it's something that has to be addressed on every mission depending on what the payload is that you're carrying
if you have a real heavy forward payload yeah you have to add some ballast to the aft end of the thing
now normally the way they do it is they'll find some payload that can fit in the aft end to help ballast that
but i think in some of the early flights we put some ballast in the back for cg control
we've carried many tons of lead into orbit so it was ballasting the thing for control purposes
the same way yesterday in jet blue a lot of people had to move to the back end of the airplane because they wanted that cg for a little bit different landing performance one thousand three hundred seven bulkhead we saved about five hundred pounds there
now see what we're doing
we started out with the initial trades in the early concept phases
what's the wing loading
we didn't care about what the internal structure trades were
now we're getting down to trading all the stuff at a semi macro level
and i'll show you in a minute a micro level that we had to get into which was pretty interesting
how are we doing time wise
we're ok
so we saved some weight there
an interesting thing about the payload bay doors
we decided that for this vehicle to be safe and to re enter those doors had to close
we had a lot of trouble in gemini with things on orbit not working
mechanical systems quite often are problems
docking systems are problems
there have been a lot of door problems on orbit in spacecraft
and you design them and you put them in thermal vacuum chambers and they all work but you get on orbit and sometimes they don't work
maybe it's thermal distortion that we're not accounting for
so we said that is critical
we've got to close these payload bay doors
what we did was say the way we're going to do that is the payload doors will carry only two types of load
they will carry pressure loads like jeff talked about and they'll carry torsion loads
because if they are closed we know that it is good for torsion in the vehicle reacting torsional loads
but we will not let them carry body bending loads or else we cannot make them flexible enough
what we did is all of the body bending in this vehicle is carried along this longeron through this section in the lower skin of the vehicle
this is the modulus of the vehicle if you will at a cross section here between this longeron and the lower skin
payload bay doors don't come into being
and the way the doors close on orbit is they start zipping along from here up to the top because they are flexible
and the same way back here they zip closed zipping just a latch at a time
they were sort of ratcheting themselves closed
and then they close along the center line
there has never been a problem with payload bay door closures on orbit
it was something we decided to add to the design
we could have made the vehicle lighter had we not done that but we would have also complicated the safety of the vehicle if we had done it
sort of in line but it's not the cg thing we had a payload attachment issue
and when we were laying out all this stuff in the early seventy s we didn't know what the payloads were
we knew what the total mass was
we knew there may be five at a time
we didn't know what they were
now you can just go in and bolt a payload into the fuselage of the orbiter
and if you just do that randomly or without thinking about it now all of a sudden you start analyzing the orbiter and you start twisting it what happens
the payload becomes part of the load path
now all of a sudden you have impacted the design of the payload or maybe you have impacted the design of the orbiter depending on what is happening in the payload
we said ah ha what we'll do is make it so it's statically determinant
if two things are attached statically determinately they cannot interact with one another as far as their stiffnesses are concerned
we said that's what we're going to do
we'll put attachments along the longerons to carry the axial loads some along the keel to carry some of the lateral loads
viola we've got it
so the requirement became that we would design it that way
our next step was and you can ask al louviere when he comes up about that because al louviere and max faget told me they would never fly with those longerons that way
we did it anyway
what we had to do then was say now we understand what the attachment is
how do we determine within the cg constraints for these different masses and we had to assume what they were not knowing exactly the definition of the payloads
we did a monte carlo analysis
ten million cases of combined payloads
cg locations numbers of payloads forward aft all that
and we did that with a monte carlo analysis
we said voila that's where we're going to design the mid fuselage
that's the way we did it
now getting into the detail design loads
how do we determine all these things now
because now it's coming down to sizing the vehicle
this part of the flight regime from liftoff through max q that's a critical loading condition a critical design for the orbiter
when it gets into orbit pretty benign
nothing is really happening up there except some temperatures which are going to be important at this point over here because now all of a sudden you start adding more heat into it
now you get into the regime where you're maneuvering in the atmosphere
now you're in a different loading regime which becomes critical
so critical as far as the airframe is concerned is here and over here only
let me break that down into the constituent portions there
liftoff loads
we had another statistical challenge here because what we had to do was needed to look at all the variables associated with the rocket engines
they have start sequences
we've got three main engines that are not going to start exactly the same time
they're not going to come up with the same thrust profile as they start up
the thrust vector misalignment is going to be different
and we also had to look at ignition over pressure
and i'll show you that was a surprise to us
also part of liftoff we had to look at winds and gusts vortex shedding proximity of aerodynamics to the other structures is on the gantry in the pad
and then we had to do the pressurization and also look at shrinkage of these vehicles that components or elements at cryo temperatures
here was a cross section in a generic sense of what's happening during liftoff
there is some combination of winds that you have to account for
and i will show you what we did there
the thrust profile from the ssmes
the srbs come up to thrust after you get confirmation that the engines are operating at full performance
and there is a lot of vibration acceleration going on
here is something that becomes pretty obvious after a while
when you have a vehicle that is tied down here with a base moment and you put one point five million pounds of thrust on it this vehicle is going to bend over this way
there is a lot of strained energy in the solid rocket motors when that happens
if you were to ignite the srbs when that vehicle is over here the party is over because it releases all that strained energy and the srbs couldn't take it
when you see the orbiter prior to liftoff the ssmes will come up you will see the vehicle do like this
and then when it comes back over zero viola you kick off the srbs
but you have to wait until it gets back to that neutral point
a little detail that is pretty important
ascent
a really complicated part of the design of the vehicle especially with the aerodynamic surfaces
as i said before you would like for these things not to be there during ascent
they don't buy you anything
you just need them coming back
some other complications here are the acoustic effects will become important as i'll show you in acoustic fatigue for the vehicle
i showed you life
well that's going to be a critical thing
another thing is the plumes of the vehicle are changing the pressure distribution as you're going up
the pressure distribution along the orbiter especially the wing is changing the whole times you're accelerating not only through the various mach regimes but also because of the blockage from the plume expansion
we said how in the world are going to do that
we cannot analyze all those things
if we do it deterministically you won't get a capability that you need we thought operational
we said what we'll do is one piece of data that we had we had synthetic wind profiles for everything that existed at the cape
we said that's a given
we'll use these synthetic wind profiles as a guideline to all of our winds aloft
what we need to do is decide what the angle of attack and the side slip is going to be through this vehicle flying through these winds and a control system that's changing the attitude of the vehicle
that's a factor that we have to consider and that's going to be important for the design of the elevon surfaces and all because they're getting loaded up pretty heavily at that time
there are dispersions in the propulsion system that have to be added
and then what we decided to do after we looked at all that we said what we're going to do is we're going to take all these parameters and you won't find this in any textbook but we created something called a squatcheloid
and i forgot to look up what squatcheloid means
it must be a greek term that was really good
but what we did was flew the vehicle through different mach numbers
and we looked at the various conditions we could get at for combinations of dynamic pressure and angle of attack and dynamic pressure and side slip for all the mach numbers and then we said is that realistic to do not only from a control systems standpoint but from a standpoint of the propulsion system capability
and we said it is feasible to do so we ought to design within those envelopes
what we did was walked our way around all of these external points with pressure and inertial loads and everything else and we looked at the structural model that we had simplified
and we said we found the points that were critical for the vertical stabilizer for the outboard elevon et cetera and that's the way we designed the vehicle for ascent loads
the thing that that enabled us to do too is it enabled us to do a rational combination that aaron brought up a while ago
what did you do with the ssmes for engine out and that kind of stuff
it let us do a rational combination of engine out and also engine vector control
you could design the thrust structure so that the engines went out to the extremes but it didn't make sense as far as the control system was concerned
what we did is we saved a lot of weight in the vehicle by using a deterministic or realistic
i should say ssme thrust profile and vector characteristics
well i just mention that
that's what the squatcheloid did for it
also what it did was then gave the guys who were designing ascent trajectories now they had an envelope to design to which was key for their operations
next problem
now we come back to descent loads
when you said that you designed it for realistic cases instead of worst cases does that mean the engines were never able to vector all the way out to maximum
right
it just could not happen
it could not happen
that was a failure mode that it had enough redundancy and it couldn't happen and there wasn't any need of creating a load condition like that
it couldn't happen
ok so you looked for it
we looked for the cases where you could be in the worst case winds the worst case misalignment with the srb with the different throttling of the engines
and we did all that and said to control this vehicle because if you cannot control the vehicle there's no need to look at that load case
we said to control it within those environments what's the extreme of the engines
we said that's a design case for the thrust structure
good question
descent loads
this was pretty easy
the structure guys said this is a piece of cake because this vehicle is coming back in in a ballistic trajectory
and viola there are not even loads on this vehicle
well that didn't make a whole lot of sense because we knew that there would have to be more maneuvering capability than anybody was fessing up to
not that they weren't trying to hide it but we weren't smart enough
the aaron cohen guys weren't smart enough to know all the conditions we would have to fly it to
what we did was we went through the classical venn diagram where you're plotting for different mach numbers
the normal load factor versus the velocity of the vehicle that it can fly in that flight regime
we said if this thing is going to behave like an airplane and have to perform like an airplane we are going to design it like an airplane
we caught a lot of guff
when bass redd comes in and talks in the future ask him about this because he fought us on this hand and foot
he said you guys don't have to design it that way
we said well we're going to but let him have capability in his aerodynamics and talk to the control system guys about that too
and i see the draper guys left on that
we said we're going to build in that capability for this thing to maneuver like an airplane two point five g's normal load factor
follow up classical venn diagram where we have equivalent airspeed of three hundred seventy five psf
we were determining what the equivalent air speed for those conditions was
and then we did it
now we've gotten up to a point i'll call cdr and a point i should have mentioned a while ago
when i showed the authority to proceed there aren't any drawings which exist except some sketches
i mean there are mol line drawings and that's about it
and the mol line of the vehicle was what came out of all the other studies
it said that's it we've got to put everything within this mol line for this vehicle to perform like it is
but there are no detailed drawings
when you get to a preliminary design review in a classical design and development program typically that's about where you reach ten percents of your drawings that are released
and what does it mean to release a drawing
that means you sign it off whatever your discipline is and it say we can make this airplane to these drawings and it's given to the people to go make it
so once you release a drawing you don't ever want to bring it back and change it because it costs you a lot of money
the pdr which was somewhere like about seventy three seventy four somewhere like that that was the state which we existed
we hadn't defined everything on the structural low pass like i told you about a while ago nor the materials
now we're at the detail design
now we're into cdr that's the critical design review and ninety percents of all your drawings are released
and now it gets very expensive to go back and change
you can just see how it would ripple through the entire operation if you change a drawing at that time
you have to to make it work sometimes but you like not to change it
what we have to do here our challenge from a structural point of view is to complete the design do some of the details which means get weight out of the vehicle where you can scrape it without really changing a lot of stuff
and then also decide how you're going to certify the vehicle
it means what you're going to do on the ground to say it's really safe for the crew to get in
that's what that was
weight reduction is a major part of the program
here are some of the things that we took out about this timeframe
we took out nine hundred pounds of weight in the payload bay doors
we didn't change the configuration they were still flexible but they were aluminum honeycomb
we said we can save nine hundred pounds if we go to graphite epoxy
graphite epoxy characterization of the material didn't even exist then
literally aaron myself and three or four other guys sat around
we said ok aaron this is what we have this is what we know about it here are the risks associated and here is the weight savings
go for it
so we went for it and it worked
that was the largest graphite epoxy structure ever flown
we characterized it passed that on to the industry and that helped a bunch
another little interesting thing i have to watch my time here
i mentioned the spending profile
well we got into the program about the time we were starting to make the payload bay doors which is probably seventy five seventy six
and aaron didn't get all the money that he needed
we built the first set of payload bay doors which is people process dependant
it's like laying up fiberglass
it was all hand layup with epoxy and bake it and all that kind of stuff
we got the first set built and we fired everybody because we didn't have enough money to keep them on the payroll for the rest of that year
we literally laid everybody off at rockwell in tulsa
and they came back a year later not all of them but we had to start over again
so there is a risk associated with that
thrust structure
we saved one thousand two hundred pounds by stiffening like i told you about a while ago
and then we used a bunch of other composites
a lot of people said especially after challenger let's get rid of this vehicle because it's antiquated and was designed too long ago
that probably is still one of the most advanced composite structure vehicles flying today
except where there is a lot of aluminum honeycomb you probably could go with graphite epoxy
and i will give you a challenge with that later on
but there are beryllium aluminum struts in here
there are boron epoxy scab on devices
there is graphite epoxy all over the vehicle
not all over the vehicle
in a lot of places in the vehicle
the vehicle has got a lot of composites
and we stretched to be able to do that
certification
now we've got the thing pretty well designed
what are we going to do to certify this thing
this is where we deviated from the norm and were pretty innovative
classically in the way this program started off there was a dedicated structural test article and there was a dedicated fatigue test article
there were a couple of problems with that
if you don't need it you might as well not build it even though that was in the program
the situation was as i showed you a while ago thermal stress was a major part of that
you couldn't apply a mechanical and thermal load to this vehicle and still be practical
concorde did it
the way that concorde was designed and certified they applied mechanical loads in an environment in which they could induce the temperature by convective heating on that vehicle
and it took them like three years to test the vehicle
and it was extremely expensive
it was a big jobs program for greg britton and france and some of the others but we decided we couldn't afford to do that so we are going to have to figure out how else to do it
besides that aaron had dollars one hundred million problem that year
what can you guy help us do
what we'll do we think we can do this is take an airframe and we will apply one hundred ten percents of the limit mechanical loads only to it
and that doesn't certify anything
and then we will put strain gauges all over this vehicle
and we will pre predict what the strain response is going to be for three thousand points on the vehicle
if we can pre predict what the strain response is for applying a bunch of different loads then we know how to analyze the vehicle
that proves we know how to analyze it
we can extrapolate to one hundred forty percents to our ultimate load capability from mechanical and we will add the thermal stress to it analytically
so we did that
and then we refurbished the vehicle and that became challenger
the test article is going to cost dollars one hundred million
we said we don't need it
we'll use it for a flight airframe
and aaron gave us a little ceramic eagle for doing it
don't anybody expect as out of this deal if aaron has anything to do with it
there it was
we applied the million and a half pounds of load at the backend
we concentrated through loading fixtures loads on the wings of the fuselage put pressure differential at various points on the vehicle and we did exactly what i said
fatigue life
mechanical fatigue was not a problem
acoustic fatigue was an issue because we had some really lightweight structures and really high acoustic levels
you cannot see it here
it was like one hundred sixty five db around the base end of the thing lower levels on other portions so we said how are we going to do that
we came up with a different way to do it
what we will do is we'll go around the vehicle and we will identify a characteristic structure graphite epoxy aluminum seven thousand seventy five point six aluminum fuselage up here wing elevon aluminum honeycomb et cetera
we identified forty four test articles
we said that's what we'll do
we went to aaron and said it's going to take us forty four test articles
we went through all the rationale with each one of them and he said you can have fourteen
and so we said but that won't work
he said go figure it out
we went back and scratched out heads
sure enough we figured out how to do more extrapolation
so we had fourteen test articles that you see
and then what we did was say now we've got our test articles
our approach to this thing was we would test them to failure acoustically
now we have an acoustic allowable for that type of structure because it's a function of the details
i mean it had to be the detail
and in addition to making sure we have a good test if this was our acoustic fatigue test article only the center third was a viable part of the test because the rest of it is boundary conditions that weren't right because they were clamped along the edges or whatever
we said only the middle third of the test article is viable
we tested that we got a fatigue allowable from acoustics and then we degraded it analytically for combined mechanical and combined thermal
we did that and said also we know that it's probably not going to fail on the first flight so we'll do some inspections
tom let me just make a comment
he made it sound a lot simpler than it was
one thing that's important whenever you do a project or you're in charge of something you don't want to have yes people around you
you want to have people that say you're not doing it right
and it didn't go down that simple
they were not yes people believe me
they were certainly not yes sir we're going to go do this
that's very important
it's a wonder we still speak to one another
i'm sorry
i don't know what a test article is
it's a test specimen
if you wanted to put so much mass in here and you weren't sure whether this seam was going to work
you just put that much mass in here
you add a little bit more to it and you see if that seam breaks
that's your test article
that's what it is just a test specimen test article
but that's a good point because don't forget we start off with two entire dollars one hundred million test articles for static test and for fatigue test
not counting acoustic fatigue
that was just mechanical fatigue
as we got into it we said we don't need that
did the challenger's mission life drop because of the test
no
as a matter of fact that's a very good question
that was one of the questions that was asked by the investigation is what's different about this vehicle than any other vehicles
well it was a static test article
and we showed ad nauseam that had nothing to do with the failure of challenger
the leading edge was not oh no excuse me
i'm off on columbia now
no it didn't have anything to do with it
as a matter of fact this is getting into detailed details now when you apply above a limit load on a vehicle like we did on challenger it puts a lot of the joints in residual compression
there is compression at the joint just as you load it and you unload it
and residual compression increases the fatigue life of the vehicle
and the reason it does is because fatigue is the function of tensile cycles not compressive cycles normally
when mcdonnell douglas tested a dc ten and they proof load a vehicle it carries a premium on the selling price for that because it theoretically has a longer life than one that hasn't been loaded
good question
tom one more question
yeah
how much did an increase in computer processing speed and availability allow you to do these extrapolations and like do the thermal testing just analytically
was that a key factor
you mean how much as it increased
well how much did it increase between like say apollo and designing the shuttle
not a whole lot
as far as the analytical capabilities of the finite element models and all you could get more detail through simplification
there are more elements available let me put it that way
but as far as the crunching capability it increased somewhat but we were still you know if you have to go from here to here we were about here
that isn't a quantitative answer for you but we're still a long way
we basically used mainframes and we did have the nastran model
yeah we had nastran
but nastran didn't have on a large model like that the large capability for structural loads and thermal loads
but you used to put your cards in one day and it would take a couple days before you got your answer
to do a complete load cycle on this vehicle for internal loads it was something like three months it would take us to do that
and so it was quite
that's another story
thermal protection system
change gears now
let's talk about the thing that protects the vehicle
now i'm going to switch back and go back to get ready to proceed toward preliminary design
what were the requirements on the thermal protection system
it had to protect the vehicle from max temperatures like about two thousand eight hundred degrees on the surface reusable one hundred times it had to be lightweight and had to be cost effective
pretty simple high level requirements
and doctor bob ried will talk to you about the things that they derived as far as the aerothermal in this and how it became that but it was a given to us
what did we know about this thing
well we had some ablative tps experience from apollo
gemini had some metallic tps on it primarily rene forty one and some other exotic materials
mercury had an ablative tps but they weren't reusable
they were hot structure designs which existed but that we didn't have materials that could carry the load at temperature such that it could be a fully hot structural design and that was extremely complex
metallic tps we could get there theoretically with some fairly exotic materials called columbium and rene forty one and some other things but the devil is in the detail in that
let me tell you a story about that
we were looking at some haynes one hundred eighty eight panels
and so we had a test article a big panel about the size of the desk that you're sitting at any one of you there and it was corrugated so that it could expand and contract
and it was good for one thousand eight hundred degrees so we tested it to one thousand eight hundred degrees in the center of the panel multiple times
and it had a frame around it where the panel could move around because it needed to to be able to thermally expand
and the center of the panel was one thousand eight hundred degrees the edge of the panel where the heat sink was was forty degrees lower temperature than the center
and the panel floated within a gap maybe about like that so it could move around pretty good
but what it also did with that temperature differential of forty degrees we got something called creep buckling
the structure expanded and crept and deformed permanently
had we flown that vehicle had we designed a vehicle like that what that would have done is would have allowed plasma to flow through the shingles if you will and into the structure
and that's exactly what happened in columbia
letting the hot plasma gas get in the vehicle you cannot stand it
it's the details about that
we said we're not going to go with a metallic design
plus if you scratch it it oxidizes
and if it oxidizes then it can fail
so we went with something that was just coming online and that was a fused silica material
and fused silica is pure sand pure silica material
that's all in the world it is
the process is you make it into a fibrous structure if you will
fibrous material is a better term
a fibrous material that is mostly air
it is about the same density as balsa wood
it has an ultimate strength of about twelve psi tensile load is about all that it can take but it has a thermal performance that is fantastic
as you will recall this chart here when you look at li one thousand five hundred is what that was with aluminum
and that's what we went with we used this same characterization to decide what the material we were going to use was on the vehicle from a weight standpoint and a cost standpoint
the way the tiles work thermally like this is the low strength brittle almost like glassy material it's a ceramic is coated with literally a glass coating on the outside about sixty thousandths of an inch thick and it's black
as the vehicle comes back in and dissipates its energy through drag and heating ninety percents of the heat is radiated away from the vehicle ten percents of it goes into the vehicle
but this is such a good thermal isolator a poor thermal conductor by the time the heat gets to the vehicle the vehicle is back into an atmosphere where it's not heating anymore
that dictated the thickness of these tiles of this silica material
the vehicle has got almost twenty one thousand tiles on it and they vary anywhere from a half inch thick up to about three inches thick
it's sculptured to stay within the mol line because the aerodynamicist told us what it has to be
and so what we did was sculptured the tps so that we didn't have any more than we needed
great job by all the thermal analysts
i mean they did this fantastic
i want to mention when that says nine pound or twenty two pound tiles that's not the weight of each individual tile that's the density per cubic foot
per cubic foot correct
thank you jeff
what was the footnote about columbia on that
on the last chart tom there is a footnote about the difference in the columbia
let me come back to that in just one second
what i want to talk to you about right now this is something i had from some old material
i was just trying to get a characterization
what that said is on columbia there was an infrared sensor as an experiment
so the number of tiles varied on that vehicle compared to all the other vehicles because of this infrared thing at the top of the vertical stabilizer
i should have cut that off
you're reading too close
we thought let's figure out how to take this fragile material and put it on this aluminum structure which has a high thermal coefficient of expansion
the tiles have almost a zero thermal coefficient expansion
we said we've got to isolate that
we put a strain isolation pad
why do they vary in density
yeah
because primarily for strength for one of the things
and the li two thousand two hundred was a little bit higher temperature capability
and i don't remember
but it had a little higher peak temperature capability
and that was dictated by what one of the failure modes of a tile was if you exceed the temperature too much it starts slumping
i don't want to say melting but it begins to distort
and a li two thousand two hundred didn't distort to the same extent that a li nine hundred tile did
we said let's isolate the structure here from this material up here which is required to keep from failing all these tiles so we put something between them
it was just a very loosely woven felt material
now we proved that the aluminum can expand all it wants to or within limits we looked at it realistically and that the tile was ok except the tile couldn't be too large because of this relative expansion and contraction
so that dictated the size of the tile
we literally pre cracked them if you will
we put expansion joints is another way of looking at it
a typical tile is six inches by six inches when it gets into the highly heated area
now all of a sudden we've got some room for the title to move relative to one another structure to move underneath it because of the strain isolation pad
and we said viola we've got this problem fixed
we're good to go
we said we've got twenty five thousand of these tiles that we now have to certify that they're good to go for the vehicle
there were gaps between the tiles
correct
but when you re enter do the tiles expand so that there are no gaps
no
what we do is make sure that the gap can just close but not close such that you're loading one tile relative to the other
that set the gap
and if during manufacturing which is not that precise if the gap was too large we just stuck a gap filler in
not the one that was on the last vehicle
it's a different kind of gap fill
just a piece of nomex or sip material strain isolation pad coated with rubber or with rtv and we stuck it in between the tile just to reduce the flow if the gap was too large
so there is no chance that you would have hot plasma coming in between them
yes there is a chance you can have plasma going through there if the gap is too large
we had a very specific requirement
i think it was like ninety thousandths of an inch between tiles
and if it were say one hundred thirty thousandths of an inch as installed because of tolerance buildup and all that kind of stuff then what we did was stuck a plasma flow preclude if you will a gap filler between those to stop the plasma flow from getting between the tiles
and we had some experience where we lost some gap fillers plasma flowed between the tiles
caused excessive heating on the tiles and started causing them to slump and melt a little bit did a little bit of structural deformation but nothing significant
losing gap filler was a turnaround issue not a safety of flight issue
we made sure of that
excellent question
this is more of a general question but i'm wondering if since then anybody has done any work to find a material that could accomplish both tasks the structure and the thermal protection rather than having to deal with these types of issues
that was back to one of my trades were we said let's take that approach and see if we cannot design a vehicle that can take the temperature and the loads too both
there was no material that existed
i don't think a material exists today that i know of to be worked to a high enough stress that you can keep the weight down to have those kinds of temperatures and to be worked at a high temperature
i think on the x thirty three design they were talking once again of trying to make it out of a metallic structure
part of it was structure and part of it was tons
but we never got to the point of being able to fly and test it
but they also were using a thermal isolation system like tiles over part of the vehicle on the x thirty three
the buran which was the soviet copy of the shuttle they were very anxious to get away from the expense of the tiles
and they ended up with a thermal protection system not very different than what you said
you mean they had tiles
yeah
as a matter of fact i remember they were more like bigger blankets
that's a good point larry
i was about to skip over it
i said they were typically six inches where they were really thick but in other areas we made like twelve or fifteen inch tiles that were very thin
and the reason we could do that is we decided if they crack it doesn't matter because the gap wouldn't be large enough for the plasma flow to go through there and it would simply be a self relieving
so we tried to reduce the cost of manufacturing by making some of these tiles larger
and i will show you that in just a second
i'm going to skip forward here and show you one thing
that's fifty thousandths of an inch
the allowable for the tile was twelve psi
the ultimate stress was twelve psi
the allowable stress was about eight psi
and that's with the total loads combined on the tile
what do you have to consider in one of these twenty five thousand tiles that you have to assure is not going to come off the vehicle
remember i said when we looked in the early phase studies of the vehicle we were looking at wing loads and stuff like that
then we got into how is the wing going to carry the load into the fuselage to the spar and what was our design trade on that
those were sort of macro and semi macro systems engineering studies
now we're into a micro
now we've got this little critical part six inches by six inches
lose any one of about ten thousand and you lose the vehicle
it's got an eight psi allowable strength
we said well that's no big deal
what are all the environments on this thing
we started looking at pre liftoff liftoff ascent et cetera
there is always something called mismatch
when you take something that is not perfectly smooth and you bond something to it and they are not to the same flatness if you will there is going to be a stress induced into both parts of those
well the structure doesn't care about that stress but this little eight psi allowable tile does
it says we cannot exceed about nineteen thousandths of an inch under one of these tiles for this to happen
there is ignition over pressure during ascent
there is acoustic and vibration and that kind of stuff that has to be considered
on ascent there are gradients because of shock moving across the tile
there is internal pressure
there is skin friction and drag on the tile so you've got to consider that
you have to consider the dynamics the inertial loads induced in it
and the out of plane deflection is now the vehicle flying
the structure is deforming
so you've got to consider that
now you can see you've got twenty five thousand tiles with all these combinations of load conditions so how in the hell do you design that
this is the characterization of it
this is what happens with a structural deformation of like ten thousandths of an inch deflection underneath a tile
with that kind of formation it causes one psi
and it linear almost
so twenty thousandths of an inch deflection is going to cause two psi
well two psi is not a lot but it's a quarter of your allowable
we said we've got to consider that
we have to understand what is happening to this structure as you fly it a condition
this is a free body if you will of the pressure distribution on a tile
it has internal pressure within the tile
it has a pressure differential on the outside of the tile because of a shockwave moving across it because of the pressure as it varies around the vehicle
so you have to consider all of that
we did all that and said we've got a problem because what happened was all of a sudden our allowable on our tile was decreased by half
and this was not good
we screwed up in the systems engineering point of view when we did this
remember we put the strain isolation pad underneath the tile and we did all these other loads on it
what we forgot or what we didn't realize was this strain isolation pad had little stiff spots in it because of the way it was stitched to keep the strain isolation pad together
and every stiff spot acted like a hard point
now when you take a tile and you put external loads on it and there is a stress concentration on each one of those things that stress concentration had an amplification of two
all of a sudden our allowable were decreased by a factor of two
and we thought we have a major problem
this is when aaron and i got to know one another better than we ever wanted to
we met every day on this thing
we had tiles bonded all over the vehicle
necessity was the mother of invention
what we had to do was dissipate this stress concentration
we said we'll put a plate underneath it a graphite epoxy plate or something like that
that would have added a lot of weight to the vehicle
glen ecord a materials guy came up with the idea in the lab one weekend he took silica powder in water and just painted it on the bottom of the tile
what it did was fill all the pours in the tile for about three sixteenths of an inch
and just compacted themselves in there
and that was an inherent capability of a tile with that powder packed in it if you will that doubled the strength of the tile
what it did is it dissipated the load from being concentrated into the tile
so without any weight some cost we had to pull some tiles off the vehicle and densify them
now all tiles are densified
i meant to bring one to show you today but i didn't
analytically we went through twenty five thousand tiles
here was our factor of safety distribution over the entire vehicle
we said we're good for that but the thing we don't know is if the tile is really bonded on the vehicle like it should be
we said we can fix that problem
we will verify it
we will pull on every tile and make sure that it has a capability of the maximum expected mechanical load that it is going to see
and so we pulled on every tile
and john yardley being an old stress guy says let me ask you a question
when you pull on every tile how do you know you haven't induced more damage and decreased the allowable of the title because of your proof test
good question
easy answer
we'll put a microphone on every tile and we will characterize the sound of the tile as we pull up on it and we will get a sound allowable if you will for proof testing the tile
we did that on every tile that had to be proof tested
we had an acoustic emission device we had a microphone on there we characterized all these tiles and we did it
another little mother's necessity of invention
and i'm not going to go through this
you'll get a handout of this
what this did is said you cannot proof load every tile every tile is not densified some tiles are thick some tiles are thin but prove under no uncertain conditions that you're safe to fly
we went through this logic on everything
some of these things had gates that said go directly to fly
others we had to go through
others we had to pull off the vehicle and densify and proof load and do a bunch of other things to prove that they were ok
we got there
now we're into operations
we're just about out of time
i know
i've got three minutes left
can i have all three
ok
here is what we did
we did some pretty innovative things on this thing and i think i've shown you some of that stuff
but what were the surprises we had on the first flight
not very many
as we were going uphill i told you about the plume effect from the engines blocking the flow that causes the pressure distribution on the wing to be different than we designed for
the center pressure was further aft and outboard
that loaded up the wing more
it could not fly to the design conditions that we needed to under worse case
and i'll tell you what we did on that
well let me just tell you right now
what we did was almost day of launch wind analysis loads analysis for the wings with load indicators in the wing to understand what a specific flight regime was going to do for that vehicle
and we literally designed the trajectories for the first six or eight or ten shuttle flights so it stayed within a reduced capability of the vehicle
because we characterized it so well we could do that
the other thing was the overpressure of the vehicle when the main engines let off there was an accumulation of hydrogen gas underneath the vehicle
and as soon as the engines fired it ignited that hydrogen and sent a big shockwave up the vehicle
it could have been pretty bad but it wasn't so we fixed that by isolating the isolation and also burning it off prior to engine ignition
and then we got some tile damage from external tank
we fixed that
after about the second or third flight on the external tank we changed the foam process and controlled that
and so those were our only surprises
you remember the chart that i showed you of all the combined environments on a tile
this is not politically correct what i'm going to say but i'm going to say it anyway
the shockwaves the pressure the out of plane deformation all that you didn't see debris anyplace on that chart
those tiles are not designed for debris period
you can rationalize it
you can arm wave it
you can statistically analyze it
the vehicle is not designed to fly in debris
it can take every other thing it's designed for but it cannot take what it's not designed for
the engineers today have two choices
they can either eliminate the debris from the external tank or in my judgment they can go back and recertify the tiles for the expected debris
and that's probably not too big a deal but they cannot say we're ready to fly going through a logic matrix like i did until they do that
ok guys and gals
here are some challenges for you
as you go through from the beginning of a program i would like you to be looking at this crew exploration vehicle what other parameters would you look at other than what i've shown you here and what tools would you use
on the combined thermal mechanical i think a lot can be done on that
i don't know what all the computing capability is today but i think that you could really simplify and probably decrease the weight of the vehicle by doing that
could they be made more rugged
yeah they probably could
but be careful
this is a big systems engineering issue and it's a political issue
and i'm going to get off the stage here in one second
should there be a dedicated crew escape system or should the reliability be built in the vehicle
and i'll promise you that answer is not known
it may be known from a political standpoint that you have to have a crew escape system and that's ok
if that's a requirement that's a requirement but in a total system crew safety reliability that's not obvious
it depends on what the design is and what the reliability of the constituent elements are
how would you fix the et
put shrink wrap all over it
another thing that's not part of the curriculum here is political systems engineering
you can have the best engineering design in the world but if you don't have the political support in a program like this it doesn't matter
how does political influence come into a systems engineering thing kind of like the crew escape system
thank you
well that was just super
this is hopefully the first of many lectures which will take us to a much greater depth
we talked about and gone through the history of the shuttle a little bit
we're going to go into it some more today
but to refresh your memory there really were three subsystems on the shuttle that were pressing the state of the art
one was the thermal protection system which we talked about tom moser talked about
the other was the avionic system with the computers the computer synchronized
the four computers synchronized because as we explained the orbiter really needs a computer to fly because it is a fly by wire system which is statically unstable
and the other system that was pressing the state of the art was the space shuttle main engine
it had a high pressure high temperature and high performance
and so you're going to hear about that today
now the person that's going to talk to you
many of you i'm sure heard the term rocket scientist but you probably don't really know what that means
well today you're going to meet one
you're going to meet a true rocket scientist
j_r thompson was responsible for the design development test and operation of the space shuttle main engine
during apollo j_r had a very similar function in the design and working on the launch vehicle for the apollo vehicle
he became director of the marshall space flight center
then he was deputy administrator at nasa in washington
and now he's president of orbital sciences
you're in for a real treat
thanks aaron
aaron asked me to consider this talk i don't know several months ago
and i was a little hesitant at first but then the more i thought about it it's given me a good opportunity to go back and kind of recount some of the highlights and the low points in the program
it was some thirty years ago for me
so there is some of this that's going to be still a little fuzzy
but there is a lot of it that it's just like it was yesterday
actually the shuttle main engine has its roots back in the technology programs that were funded and came out of apollo
as early as the mid one thousand nine hundred sixty s people at the marshall space flight center in the same propulsion group that i was in although my attention was focused on apollo at that time were heavily involved with pratt and whitney rocketdyne and aerojet in developing the high pressure turbomachinery that would one day be envisioned to use in the shuttle if there ever were a shuttle
so that's back when it started
and there was a good bit of effort put in at that time
i think as you probably know rocketdyne of north america won the contract in july
actually july thirteen th of one thousand nine hundred seventy one
so shortly after apollo
apollo was still winding down when the shuttle program got its legs
and the shuttle main engine was one of the very early awards because as aaron indicated
it was early on envisioned that that would be what we called back then the long tent pole in the program
it came on the heels of a one year phase b competition between pratt rocketdyne and aerojet
during this phase b nasa funded some technology demonstrations requirements definition and that kind of thing
actually rocketdyne at that time did a very bold demonstration of what they call power head
and i will show you what that encompassed in just a minute
but it was a demonstration of the heart of the engine
it only operated for a short period of time but very high pressure
it was risky
they pulled it off
it was actually driven by a fellow called paul castenholz who was a guy coming out of apollo that basically solved or lead the team that solved the combustion instability on the f one engine
paul was a very ambitious fellow very aggressive and very bold in trying to capture this award for rocketdyne
at that time though nasa envisioned what they called a fly back booster
the shuttle main engine was envisioned to be a common engine for the fly back booster as well as the orbiter
in that early concept there would be twelve ssmes on the backend of the fly back booster operating at five hundred fifty thousand pounds of vacuum thrust
and on the orbiter configuration it was three engines operating at six hundred thirty two thousand pounds of thrust in vacuum
because of the money that was forecasted at that time and that had been appropriated to date nasa was always behind the power curve in the early phases of the program
and they never got everything they wanted
and i'm sure that dale myers and others that have preceded me have told you the ins and outs of why then nasa scaled back from the fly back booster to the solid rocket motors
and so at that point the shuttle main engine was refocused at four hundred seventy thousand pounds of thrust
and that was what's called the rated power level
at that time i think there was a full power level and an emergency power level of one hundred nine percents
of the rated thrust that was in the program but i'll show you a view graph in a minute that has the specific parameters of the engine as it finally settled out
after the award pratt and whitney protested
it was a hard fought competition
nasa had specified that they wanted an engine bell configuration a nozzle bell as opposed to rocketdyne's aerodynamic spike that they had promoted in the late sixty s
i'm not sure if everybody here knows what an aerospike is
you may say one or two things about it
well it's a truncated nozzle
actually it's packaged and derives the nozzle from the expansion of the gases here where the nozzle wall is formed by additional gases that come out in the cooling system
and it's a very high performing engine
its packaging is certainly an advantage where you don't need a big boat tail say like you would with the engine
you're saving about ten or twelve feet there and the weight that goes along with it
pratt and whitney had been focusing on a bell nozzle all the time
and frankly those of us that were kind of on the periphery of this program and still involved in the apollo kind of figured that pratt had the advantage in this because rocketdyne was of course awarded the propulsion systems for the apollo saturn program
and it was kind of viewed as pratt and whitney's turn
it didn't turn out that way
i attribute a lot of that to the good proposal the boldness and the demonstration program that rocketdyne accomplished during the competitive period
anyway pratt and whitney protested
it took about nine months for the protest to be settled
it was settled in favor of rocketdyne
in the meantime rocketdyne was allowed to continue to work with the contractors on the vehicle side because they hadn't made the selection at that time there
so they could continue to support their work
anyway in one thousand nine hundred seventy two it was all settled
the contract was awarded cost plus
and as i recall it was dollars two hundred million for the development which was called phase a and dollars two hundred million for the production which was called phase b
and the phase b program included i believe twenty six production engines
i won't comment as to what the costs eventually grew to but very substantially beyond that
let me kind of highlight for you the characteristics of the engine
i think i mentioned the thrust levels
the rated power level was four hundred seventy thousand pounds
it had the capability if an engine was out early and you wanted to abort the orbit to throttle the engine up to one hundred nine percents of the rated thrust that was called full power level
early on in the program i think it was termed emergency power level
but at the rated conditions it accommodated or required a little over three thousand pounds per square inch chamber pressure in the combustion chamber
the area ratio of the nozzle was seventy seven point one
it had a very good specific impulse
about four hundred fifty three point four hundred fifty four
that compares to j two in apollo of about four hundred forty two as i recall somewhere in that range
weight was about seven thousand pounds
life seven point five hours and fifty five missions
that's quite misleading though let me tell you
and i'll comment more on this as we go through
but it was a very tough development program
it took from seventy two as i mentioned through first flight in one thousand nine hundred eighty one
i joined the program after apollo and after skylab in may of one thousand nine hundred seventy four
and it was torture from there until the first flight in april of eighty one
early on it was envisioned that as i mentioned the ssme would be used for both the fly back booster and the orbiter configuration
it would use basically the same power head
you would just change out the nozzles to give you the two engine thrust levels
and so it was rather simple in that concept
of course that's not the way it worked out
it went to one configuration to service the orbiter
and so everything was optimized and focused on that
now let me say a few words about the schematic itself and what the engine looked like
in conceptual terms it had two low pressure pumps which were required to give the proper inlet pressures to both high pressure pumps to avoid cavitation
it had the two high pressure pumps
it was all fed through a common power head to a thrust chamber assembly and then into the nozzle
starting on the fuel side the fuel pump increased the pressure to about three hundred pounds per square inch
and then that went into the high pressure pump on the fuel side where the pressure was boosted to a little over six thousand pounds per square inch
about eighty percents of the fuel all went to the two pre burners the fuel and the oxidizer pre burner contrasted to about twelve percents of the oxidizer
that was to provide a very fuel rich power system to drive the two turbines the high pressure fuel pump turbine and the lox pump turbine
the turbine temperatures were in the range of one thousand seven hundred fifty degrees air ranking
almost all of the housing structure on probably eighty percents of the engine was inconel very tough steel
able to take very high pressures
as i mentioned the combustion pressure in the chamber was about three thousand pounds per square inch
at the entry to the pre burners the pressure could get up to eight thousand pounds per square inch
it was a very high pressure system up and down
it was all in series
in other words this was the way they achieved the high efficiency
all of the propellant came through the low pressure system the high pressure system into the pre burners in through the cooling circuits all in the hot gas manifold all in the main chamber all of it exited the nozzle
none was dumped overboard to simplify the flow pad
a good bit of the fuel at the exit of the high pressure pump went directly to feed the two pre burners
a good bit of it about twenty percents of it went to cool the nozzle then up through and cool the
rather drove the turbine because having cooled the nozzle it was converted to a warm gas which then drove the low pressure turbine came back in and was captured and served to cool the shell of the hot gas manifold
the same similar thing on the oxidizer side
by the way i'll mention the speed of the low pressure fuel pump was about fifteen thousand rpm and high pressure fuel pump about thirty five thousand rpm
the speed of the low pressure lox pump was five thousand rpm and of the high pressure oxidizer pump about thirty thousand rpm
the discharge of the low pressure lox pump was about two hundred fifty pounds per square inch entered into the main lox pump where the pressure was elevated to four thousand five hundred pounds per square inch
then it went some to the pre burners and the rest directly into the main combustion chamber
some part of the lock flow then was further boosted to about a little over eight thousand pounds per square inch which fed the oxidizer into the two pre burners
it was a very efficient cycle very high pressured cycle
a couple other features that you don't see on this chart there was a heat exchanger wrapped around the high pressure oxidizer turbo pump turbine which served to preheat gas to pressurize the oxidizer tank
i think those are the major points that i would make on the cycle itself
most of the problems i'll just point out here had very few problems with the two low pressure pumps
a lot of technology in the high pressure pumps both fuel and oxidizer
the main problem with the high pressure fuel pump was sub synchronous whirl and i'll say a little bit more about this in a moment
it was a very traumatic time in the early period of developing the shuttle main engine
it caused a lot of delays
a tough problem to solve
and i'll mention what caused it and how we solved it
then the high pressure oxidizer turbopump bearing overloads lox fires explosions
that was probably the single toughest component to developing the program as i recall it
i think those are the major points that i'll make there
early on it was planned because they had such a head start in planning for the development of this program to be done in a very methodical way
and they had when i say they i'm talking about the people at marshall with the people at rocketdyne a very elaborate system of design verification systems where you couldn't progress to the next stage until you had passed certain testing on a valve or on a low pressure pump
and all this was envisioned to be done at santa suzanna which is right out a short distance from canova park up in the mountain on some test facilities that both nasa and rocketdyne owned up at that time and that they were carried over and upgraded from the apollo program to be done on the component facilities up there
but because of the high pressures involved it became a very expensive undertaking a lot of money too much time huge facilities valves that were probably as big as that side wall over here to be able to handle these high pressures to assist in the development of this high pressure turbomachinery
i think it became pretty clear pretty early in the program that that very methodical way of developing the engine and that is before we go to an engine system test let's develop it at the component level so we eliminate those problems
although theoretically it sounded very good
it just didn't work
the facilities were not available in time to do that
and the money was going to be exorbitant kind of a side story
there was a contractor bovey crail as i recall was the name of the contractor out in los angeles
and early in the program when they were having contract discussions and bovey crail was late and rocketdyne at the instance of nasa was withholding money until they made certain progress
and so this fellow who was the president of rocketdyne bill brennan i was spending a lot of time out there and he invited me to sit in this meeting that he was going to have with the head of bovey crail
i guess he thought maybe it would impress him that somebody from nasa was watching this thing
anyway so i joined him
i think it was a saturday morning
and both bill and i had on suits coats and ties
and this contractor or head guy from bovey crail came in with some white bucks
he had on some yellow pants and a pink shirt
and he plopped down on bill's sofa there
and before bill could open his mouth he said all i want is my blankety blank money
and so it was a short discussion
he was there to collect his money and brennan couldn't pay him because of some of the restrictions that nasa had
so it was a messy deal trying to get those facilities built
and it became clear that we were going to have to develop the components in parallel with the engine test
it was the biggest systems engineering challenge that i think we had in the shuttle program
certainly there were a lot of challenges in major systems integrating the shuttle engine into the orbiter for example
but down at the engine level the systems engineering to develop those components the two low pressure pumps the two high pressure pumps the pre burners the hot gas manifold the main injector all the control valves
and then we also had on the engine which i didn't show on the schematic a computer
redundant computers that were cross strapped so that the input or the output could be cross strapped and be very tolerant to failure
we went to what we call an integrated subsystem test bed istb
that became the bobtail engine of the program
bobtail was a thirty five point one area ratio nozzle which allows us to not only start the engine but to operate it at the throttle condition fifty percents of the rated thrust and the nozzle would still flow full
it would not separate
and so then we could proceed with the development of the testing or the development of the engine program
it was an efficient way to go about the program so we didn't stall
it was tough because we had to solve the engine problems in parallel with the component problems all at the same time
and sometimes it was hard to tell which was the problem
we started our first test in may of one thousand nine hundred seventy five
that is me there on the left and norm reuel who replaced paul castenholz they're in the center and dom sanchini who i view to this day as the strength of the shuttle program or rather the main engine who eventually replaced norm
a few comments on the evolution of some of the people on the contractor side
i mentioned paul castenholz who to me was the key to rocketdyne winning the program
at that time and this is a personal view i think rocketdyne took a big sigh of relief after they won the contract probably relaxed a little too long got in trouble up at santa susanna in not developing that component facility
the test control centers up there coke bottles were laying around so it was not a well disciplined operation
they had gotten lax i guess was the best way to say it
norm reuel came in to run the program at the request of nasa
he had done the same job on a j two and other programs within rocketdyne for the saturn program and worked with me and the other fellows at marshall
and we appointed dom to drive this istb to help us learn how to start the engine to how we could properly integrate a number of the components into the engine and proved in the long run to be a very valuable tool
this chart depicts the buildup of run time on the engine
test seconds are plotted on the right in thousands and the number of tests plotted on the left and the year is shown down here
we started as i mentioned in one thousand nine hundred seventy five
we finally flew in april of one thousand nine hundred eighty one on sts one
the title someone asked me a little earlier that's first manned orbital flight
that's what we referred to our goal back at that time
i've highlighted along the way i believe fourteen major engine explosions all of which were very traumatic in themselves
i'll show you some pictures shortly of what an engine looks like after it goes through that
and then you can extrapolate that to envision what was in the boat tail of the orbiter had it occurred in flight and what it would have done to the flight itself
the test seconds curve is down here
you can see the long plateau of about nine months where a combination of learning to properly ignite the engine without over temping the turbine blades or other parts of the turbine combined with what i'll call this sub synchronous whirl on the high pressure fuel pump
sub synchronous whirl there is a very exotic definition of it but it's an orbiting of the shaft within the bearings themselves caused by a softening of that system
and you can imagine the softening is attributed to overheating of the bearings
you don't have the stiffness
and so this allows the rotor to orbit there vibrations get very high and we have to shut the engine down
we couldn't get into the test but about two point thirty five seconds was the nominal time before we would encounter this very high vibration and then have to shut the engine down
and then after that the engine and the turbomachinery were located down in mississippi where we were doing the testing
it wasn't like you could just try it again
you had to bring it all back replace the bearings try to figure out what the problem was and put in some kind of a fix
we went through a number of fixes trying to stiffen the system so we could be able to tolerate and drive through
i thought at that time that if we could ever get through this period then we would be all right
but as it turned out
well it manifested itself in overheating of the bearings spalling of the bearings in their raceways
i think turbine speeds at that time or the speed of the rotor was probably in the fifteen thousand rpm before you could catch the engine and shut it down operating for a second or a half a second with those high side loads inadequate cooling overheating of the bearings
you'd get the bearings back and you'd put them in your hand and they were very much damaged
i mean that was the manifestation of the problem
we went into this for quite a period of time
i think what i wanted to capture was the picture over here
ignore this
this is more dramatic
i will come back to that later
but this is a high pressure fuel turbopump
the sub synchronous whirl and the overheating of the bearings occurred on the turbine side
the coolant path is probably going to be hard for you to see but you come through some labyrinth seals here
you go down this passage up through the center of the shaft and in through some provisions that were made to cool the bearings on a turbine end
we brought in a lot of external consultants had a lot of cooperation from people across the country but after nine months it was one of the internal guys at rocketdyne joe stangeland and some of the people in his turbomachinery group that came up with the idea that there was a vortex that was occurring in this cavity on a turbine end
and what we had to do was to kill that vortex and then allow the coolant to go through
and so he put a little what he called a paddle which is this part you see right here which is about the size of dime that was screwed into here to the rotor at that point
and the first task after we included the paddle right off the block where the engine had been stalled and couldn't get beyond about two point thirty five seconds went right up to the minimum power level which is the power level we had set and planned all of the tests to accelerate to that level if we could make it
and so it was a very dramatic solution fix and allowed the program to move on and see what was behind the next hurtle we were going to run into
so this problem number one was just being able to understand and accommodate the start sequence
you had to start the engine fuel rich
any excessive oxidizer would give you a cutoff because of all the sensors that we had
the second problem and the one that causes the most time that i've mentioned is the high pressure fuel turbopump sub synchronous whirl
and then problem number three which are duplicated here several times are the lox pump explosions
they could be triggered by loss of a turbine blade on a turbine end which would unbalance the rotor overload the bearings and then cause a lox rich fire which very quickly consumed the whole engine
there were numerous well i think three rather four highlighted there
we had some other problems
i've noted a fuel pre burner burn through just a structural burn through of the
how did you eventually solve that because the last failure you had was also the liquid oxygen explosion
well i'm not sure i can differentiate between the lox pump explosions
but late in the program probably at that time we had been having for a long time problems with the turbine blades very limited life
cracks would grow
at that time we didn't really understand how long we could run them before we had to replace them so we went to dampers on the turbine blades
and this occurred fairly late in the program that eventually solved the vibration of the blades within the turbine wheel stack and allowed us to proceed
whether that was that one that caused the imbalance of the rotor or some earlier when they were primarily driven by bearing problems considered for some time
we used ball bearings in the rocketdyne turbomachinery
later in the program they had gone to roller bearings
pratt and whitney has been contracted to develop that
but the bearing problems and turbine blades were the major problem as i recall that caused the lox pump problem
as a matter of fact yes
do you think you would have had similar problems if you had developed an aerospike instead
the turbo machinery was going to have to be basically the same
and so no i think you'd have the same problems
the only problems that we had on the engine we had a nozzle steer horn failure
that was just a structural feed line that was in the shape of a steer horn at the aft end of the bell nozzle
we had two of those structural failures that were very traumatic for the program
no they were both right here
and of course as soon as you lose the coolant to the nozzle you start shutting down a lot of the engine system lox rich which causes a fire
certainly you would have eliminated those
you would have eliminated a number of i'll call them nuisance problems in terms of we had one thousand eighty tubes that made up the nozzle that we flowed the hydrogen through to keep the nozzle cool one thousand eighty of them
and we had a number of again i would call them nuisance cracks or splits in those tubes that we learned to live with
we learned to go out and put a cap on them post flight braise over and just cap off the leak
certainly you wouldn't have had those
but all of the other problems i would have seen come in between the aerospike as well as the bell nozzle
j_r the shuttle main engine had the pressures that you mentioned the three thousand pounds per square inch up to eight point zero
give us some feeling for just how much higher that was than the previous operational engine and whether the pressure itself was causing a lot of those problems
oh yes the j two chamber pressure was about seven hundred pounds per square inch as i recall it
rl ten which was the first lox hydrogen engine in the country developed by pratt and whitney chamber pressure was a couple hundred pounds per square inch
this was a real push
was it worth it
as you look back on the engine you've now taken into orbit over three hundred of these engines and one hundred flights three at a time
you have had one shut down because of a safety sensor that failed and shut one engine down in flight
and we were far enough along in the flight so we aborted to orbit and the other two burned a little longer and went to orbit
but it was a very costly program
on some reflection it was almost viewed in the late sixty s as that's the challenge
not the shuttle engine but the technology
i mean let's really drive the technology and make it very efficient very high pressure
aaron and i were talking a little earlier
the engine people had the orbiter flown a one hundred times and had several major failures people would have expected the shuttle engine i think to have been the cause
that's not the way it turned out
and i'll comment on at least a contributor in just a minute
but this is the aftermath
when you're in the middle of a development program you've got a lot of budget pressures
you've got the shuttle's first flight date changed several times you've got all that hanging over your head and then you're called down on mississippi on a test and you look down on the engine and that's what it looks like it's like a kick in the stomach
you've got to start all over
well that mental picture was in our minds fourteen times in this program where you had to start over
the recovery was typically it took about a month
we formed a team usually within rocketdyne and one within nasa to go solve the problem
probably half of the time it was fairly evident what the problem was quickly after the test
sometimes it took a couple of weeks to narrow it down it could have been this or that
and then you fix both this or that not knowing exactly what it was
and so it was a very tedious and time consuming
we were testing around the clock
if it occurred during the holidays you just cancelled your holidays and jumped in and we did what we had to do
i will mention as i look back kind of one of the dumbest things that i did on this program was somewhat associated with the testing
this happened to be i think back early on in the sub synchronous whirl days we were changing out the turbo machinery after almost every test because we were doing the damage to the bearings that i described a little earlier
and it took about three shifts to change out a turbopump down in mississippi
and then it took flight time to get the turbopump back to la and then tear it down
we had others in the meantime that we were bringing along but it was very time consuming
and it was in the middle of the summer back in whenever it was seventy five or whenever and a lot of rain showers
and that was holding us up because when it was raining or it looked like it was going to rain you couldn't open up the engine drop the pump and take it back
so that slowed us down
and so i had a brilliant idea of first of all the engine if any of you have ever been down to mississippi on those test stands it's on about the fifth level is the engine position about the fifth level
and so on about the seventh level i wanted to put here what i want to call a rain shield
put a tin roof a couple of levels higher than the engine so the workers wouldn't have to stop when it was raining
well you can probably imagine what happened
that was ok for a while
and then we were back into a test and we had a hydrogen leak
and we weren't using the igniters at that time at the end of the bell to burn off the leak
so that leak just accumulated on those two stories up to that rain shield
and then when we went into the test and lit the engine off the whole mississippi sky you know there wasn't any fuel
it burned all the wires
it didn't damage the end canal on the engine structure
i certainly got a lot of ribbing after that
and as i recall the test was toward the evening
i wasn't down there at the time to see it but was listening to the test over the phone
and the guys almost couldn't speak
i mean the whole place went up
these kinds of failures
this was not evidence of a little fuel fire
this was oxidizer and the fuel was the metal
and so it was quite a problem for us
i might mention at this time that just this last summer i attended a little event there in huntsville where the rocketdyne team came down
and now the engine program had just passed its millionth test second mark
and so you can see for sts one the total test seconds were about one hundred ten point zero
a little over half of that sixty five point zero almost seventy thousand at the rated conditions the conditions you flew it at
and so it's gone up by about a factor of ten in the meantime
another key to the shuttle engine program was the philosophy imparted by john yardley
i think he recognized early on that we had bitten off probably a little bit more than we could chew to have an engine that you could solve the problems of where you put the bearings in there
the earlier view graph i had said fifty five starts
you ran them for five starts and they came out in pristine condition
that wasn't going to happen
and the turbine blades one blade failure i actually forget how many are in those two stages on that wheel probably well over a hundred but one would offset or offload the balance on that rotor
then you would overload the bearing going at the high speed of the thirty five thousand rpm's and would fail it
the turbine blades you just could not tolerate a failure
but in evidence after testing where you can tear the blades down and de stack them and look at them under a microscope you could see fatigue cracks
and so all of us i think but john provided the leadership recognized this fact
and if the requirement were going to be that you wouldn't fly with turbine blade cracks we weren't going to fly
and so he encouraged us in that instance in bearings and probably other areas to test to failure drive it to failure know where the cliff was and then back off a sufficient amount
and then conduct your certification with cracked blades with spalled bearings so that it was clear to everybody it was clear to the people that were running the program and others that had to fly that the problem was understood we thought reasonably well understood and it was tested to accommodate that condition
and so that was the philosophy that was engrained in the shuttle
and probably not enough in some of the other areas
the shuttle engine program was a little bit blessed with this fear of failure
it's the toughest technical problem so we got the most money
i mean it's not all a downside
so we got the money to provide the test depth that provided the insight to the shuttle managers that could make the call as to when we were ready to go
the squeaky wheel gets oiled
i contrast that with maybe the famous o rings on the booster
that was a problem that was kind of observed a few tests were run but not enough you know not to failure
it wasn't ever tested to failure on the ground
it was tested so you could see that the o rings were split maybe but not to be staring at a picture like that as to what is going to happen when that o ring gives and very quickly can burn through
and the other example i would make is a tank
and this is the most frustrating to me because early on we all saw some of that foam come off but not in the sized pieces that the shuttle program saw three flights before columbia
i mean that was a piece of foam about this size
it came straight down the vehicle
it made a small dent in the aft skirt of the solid rocket boosters that were subsequently recovered
but that should have been an eye opener that that piece of foam doesn't always have to go straight down the side of that vehicle
it could get out in the slip stream and hit a wing or something
that type of testing was never done
whereas on the engine program there were a number of flaws that were accommodated and we felt comfortable with
now you go and read the challenger report you read the columbia report and they will almost tell you that nasa became comfortable with flaws
and that lead to the problem
but i take issue with that
i viewed it different because that was almost the foundation of the shuttle engine program
it was built on flaws
it was tested so wherever the soft spots were you knew it and you attacked it and tested it in the appropriate way
john yardley i keep coming back to him as a part of the certification program of which i think prior to the first orbiter flight there were eight certifications completed
one of those certifications was to be conducted
and a certification as i recall was about thirteen tests
one was abort to orbit which was six hundred twenty three seconds
and a nominal shuttle test or mission is five hundred twenty seconds i think
and then an rtls return to launch site is eight hundred twenty something seconds
it had a mix of those in there
the engine had some fpl full power level
it was tested at all of the limits but in some of those certifications we had to go into the test with cracked turbine blades
we started the test with a known crack
and we knew by analysis what its growth rate was that we had judged from other tests
and so we planted blades that did that
we did the same thing with bearings
one time both dom sanchini and i were trying to get the most on every test
we put cracked blades and spalled balls and combined them all in a test
now yardley didn't mean that
he didn't want to go that far
but there was a lot of nasa leadership that bucked up the back of the program manager's both myself and sanchini
i mean they knew the way to develop the confidence in this engine was to test it
and that became the theme
that isn't true today
and that's what i worry about
and i can come back and comment a little bit more on that in a minute
i will say a few more words about dom sanchini
he passed away about fifteen years ago probably in his early sixties was the deputy program manager on the f one engine to paul castenholz a good engineer
he was a lawyer by trade but had also accumulated a good background well steeped in engineering
he was a hard driver
he thrived on failures because he saw a failure as that's when you're on the steepest part of the learning curve
you never learn more than in the aftermath of a failure where you're forced to go through and look at all of the data and postulate a lot of other different failure modes
he thrived on it
and he made sure that the whole rocketdyne team viewed it in that light so he was a real strength to the program
i want to allow a little bit of time for some discussion
a few minutes ago i alluded to the fact but that's not the case now
the shuttle engine back in the hay day or the time period when we were in the development program we were building them around the clock out of canova park three shifts out on a manufacturing floor probably at a rate of about one a month ten a year that's about right
so a pretty high production right there
i could probably ask for a show of hands do you know how much a shuttle engine costs you know just to make one
do you have the foggiest idea
my last count was about dollars forty million
i imagine in today's money it's probably closer to dollars sixty million a copy
but today they build about three quarters of an engine a year so the production rate is way down
they test aside from a lot of the terrible consequence of the two hurricanes down at slidell you know they're not testing anything right now
but even prior to this time the testing was very infrequent
that's to save money
you don't get that much out of it
and that's the achilles' heel i view of the shuttle program
if you're not going to do it right whether you cannot afford to do it right or you have other ambitions you want to do something else in the space program or within nasa you probably ought to stop it
because it's going to be the next failure if you don't treat it right
today you've got the shuttle program back when the engine started
it is a little over almost three point five decades old
that's at a minimum two generational changes and a lot of small businesses that support the shuttle program
and so you're going to lose a lot of the knowledge when you have the turnover of these generational changes
and little things i'll tell you when you look back
one of the major disappointments to me or traumatic times in the program was back in the late seventy s when we were building the first three engines that would power columbia on sts one when we were building those engines we had a mix up of well wire in the canoga plan
and the mix up was the well wire was you know one could take a heat treat and the other one couldn't take a heat treat
i forget the application where you wanted the non heat treatable well wire but that was a mom and pop operation that came in got the well wire took it home and cleaned it and then delivered it back in baskets to rocketdyne
well they got it mixed up
and so we built the first three flight engines with well wire that would not take a heat treat that we depended on
you go out and look at those engines with inches and inches and rows and rows of wells that are not to the proper heat treat
we had to go through and analyze every section and over test those engines at a little higher pressure than we normally would have to be able to show that having been built with the wrong well wire it was still good enough because the design was up to fpl and a little beyond
that it could still take it and operate at the rated thrust condition
it is mistakes like that that without frequent manufacturing exposure without frequent test use you're going to lose in a program and will become the next
you know the program has not been surprised by a problem yet
i'm talking about all the shuttles
the o ring failures they winked early on to thiokol and then to marshall before challenger
and the foam problem has been winking all the time
and it got worse later
i suppose it has something to do with the change they made in the insulation later on
but as you know and you read the agency is at a very critical time today
they've got to make some decisions in terms of where their priorities are and what they want to try to do
and they don't want to spend money on the shuttle because they seem to be committed to replacing it
and if that's what you're going to do that's what you're going to do
but between now and two thousand ten if that's the year they choose to retire the shuttle they are not going to be motivated to test
the program is going to be at more risk over the next four years than it was in the first four years because of that reason
you don't know where the ledges are where the cliffs are
and testing once a month or once every two months is just not going to do it
you said something that i really never recognized
you said there could have been a point of time in the program where you could have gone back and reduced the pressure levels and that type of thing to make the engine a little simpler to certify
what effect would that have had
well an easy way to do it we looked at probably several years before the first flight
we had seen enough at that time to know that even with the philosophy that we had adopted we were on fairly shaky ground
i would never have guessed that the shuttle would have flown over a hundred times and never had a failure of the shuttle main engine or some problem
i would have never guessed that having looked at what i looked at
we were starting to think
and an easy way to do it is open up the throat on a main combustion chamber
if you open up the throat you relax the pressures up and down the turbine system the pre burners the pump requirements
you wouldn't have to open it up much
you'd lose a little specific impulse
you'd gain a little in thrust
and so you would get some offset there
you may want to adjust the mixture ratio overall you operate at
instead of six point zero maybe six point two
you could have done it with a modest performance here
you're not going to get it for free but you could have relaxed the pressures throughout that whole system by a change in one component
and we were contemplating that and the monies never came
it was a configuration change
there is a lot of the
what don't you know about that change is what would bother some people
i don't want to oversell it as simple but conceptually it was a simple change
that would be one
i think looking back and knowing the capability of the shuttle and to be honest being somewhat troubled quite a bit troubled by what i hear and read about nasa wanting to retire it
although i understand their reasoning
some view it as a flawed design
i don't view it as a flawed design
i think you need to relook at how you operate it
i hadn't been particularly pleased with the operation of the shuttle
watching all this foam fall off and not even raising your hand
but then after all that occurred nobody stopped and stripped all that foam off and maybe replaced it with cork that's heavier that's got some tensile strength that you can anchor it on there with glue or whatever you want to do
and it's going to cost you some performance
nasa has been biased too much
and they certainly started this in the shuttle main engine in the direction of performance where if you back off a little bit the system will be a lot more robust serve you a lot better over the long haul and maybe you don't push too much in some of these directions that have got us in trouble
do you think that we had a fictitious requirement with the performance we were trying to achieve with the shuttle
i don't think we needed it all
tell me the missions that we needed all that performance on
it's not there
you'd have to reset the manifest in some cases
well speaking for the one element that i know the most about the shuttle engine
if you folks were to undertake the job ok what would i do different
they're talking about using a shuttle engine on this heavy lift launch vehicle for a cryogenic upper stage engine
i would open that throat up and look hard at that
rocketdyne knows how to do that
they've done it
we just haven't incorporated it
although men aren't envisioned to be on that
you're still going to be a lot better off
i'll tell you a problem you're going to have with the vacuum start or at upper stage start is that start sequence
this start sequence is very very sensitive and you're probably going to have to go to tullahoma to get in some kind of a vacuum system to demonstrate that
that's going to be expensive in itself
but yes aaron i think probably across the board we set the bar higher than we really needed to
and it cost us in money
and it has also cost us in margin that we don't have that we wish we had
j_r usually around this time we take about a two minute break
ok
give your voice a rest
everybody stand up turn around and just stretch a bit
two hours is a long time to go without a stretch
i'll just give one statistic that i remember really impressed me during our initial astronaut training when they were talking about the main engine
and you talked a lot about the high pressure turbopump
this is a device that is about the size of a typical automobile engine right
that's right
it produces fifty thousand horsepower just to pump the liquid oxygen at high pressure
i mean that really gets your attention
when you talk about pushing the state of the art and trying to get a lot of power out of a small volume that just really amazed me
as was indicated i think i would like to just make a couple more remarks and then maybe open it up for some discussion in terms of points that i haven't covered that are on your mind or other questions that you'd like to ask
just kind of in summary if i look back on the program i think there were two main keys that were paramount to the success that the shuttle engine enjoyed and is enjoying through its track record today
one was a decision to use this istb to get away from the serial component test and then the systems test to try to combine it and do a systems engineering job on a thing from day one
in other words that was key to me
it might have been a little extra pain but saved a lot of time and a lot of money
and i'm not sure we could have done it the other way anyway
and the other one which may be a little bit more important but just as important was the philosophy in the program of test to failure
know where the failures are
and certainly if you look at that earlier chart we had plenty of data points
i mean we had encountered a number of them some of them three or four times
maybe in some cases we were slow learners but there wasn't just one problem with that high pressure lox turbopump
i think i'd be remiss if i didn't acknowledge some of the people as viewed from the engine that made major contributions to the shuttle
not just the engine now but to shuttle
and in rocketdyne i mentioned dom sanchini a couple of time
bob biggs who has been there since day one and has done all of the test planning and is key
he is the systems engineer on the ssme
byron wood who is now the president at rocketdyne
joe stangeland who was in charge of turbomachinery who designed this little paddle and solved this vortex problem that uncoupled us from this terrible time that we were at a standstill
matt eck who was in charge of turbomachinery at rocketdyne before he passed on several years ago
and then within nasa i had mentioned john yardley
he has now passed on as well
i don't think there would be a shuttle without john's leadership
bob thompson who you might get an opportunity to hear a little bit later i think he was a driving force in the shuttle
bob lindstrom who was my boss for some time
chris kraft who i understand you will hear or have heard
certainly aaron we had to interface with the orbiter and he had an equal challenge
arnie aldridge who i've always thought a lot of as well as dick coors
and then i'll mention bill lucas who was the director at marshall and george hardy both of whom got caught up in a later controversy on challenger
not necessarily fair but that's life
i mean they were both superb engineers and meant a lot
and then also gene covert from mit who how shall i say this came in periodically and chastised us appropriately and i think made a major contribution to the program
at the time gene was also head of the aero astro department here at mit
i'm not sure who triggered bringing gene in but i know john yardley was a key driver in that
and so i'm not sure i've touched on the kind of things you'd be interested in but i'll certainly be glad now to try to answer areas that perhaps i haven't hit or maybe make a few broader comments
i understand the only element other than the orbiter and maybe the overall system
but this is the only propulsion element that is talked about i think the tank i've already mentioned there the insulation was their tough nut
and i think having had some data there are certainly some things that we could have done differently
the solid rocket boosters there's quite a history there
thiokol has now been acquired by atk in consolidation of the solid rocket motor industry but they've also made major improvements in the way they manufacture that
those solid rocket motors are also made with glue
that's put on by hand
i remember in visiting up there after the challenger accident back when i was a director at marshall a number of changes were made to automate a lot of that
i think probably the solid rocket boosters when properly used and appropriately tested and backed up by the right analysis is an excellent propulsion system
isp is down some but they are more than adequate to do the job
j_r something that really strikes me as complicated and didn't really seem or at least i don't think we seemed to have that much problem was integrating the engine to the aft end of the orbiter
that was a complicated system but it did go pretty well
was it the main propulsion test article that did that
well yes
it was earlier when we went to school a lot on the integration of the j two into the s four b stage and the s two where the conditioning of the engine prior to engine start was important and was a big interface with the stage itself
and certainly that was true with the boat tail of the orbiter
and the main propulsion test article which aaron mentioned i guess we had a dozen tests done there somewhere between a half dozen and a dozen
as a matter of fact we had a structural failure of a main fuel valve crack down in mississippi in that test article
and it caused some consternation along the way
but the integration as aaron mentioned went quite well
i don't think in flight we have ever had any problems with over pressurizing that boat tail or any problems with it
there are a number of tests that we didn't conduct or a few that we didn't conduct on the engine that i would have liked to a for curiosity and then b to fill a square so we knew exactly what would happen if we ever got in that condition
and that was with a lox depletion
there is some thought that a lox depletion is going to allow you to imbalance the rotor of the lox pumps and they're going to rub cause a fire and all that
on the other hand it is by definition going to be a fuel rich shutdown i would tend to think
but it was one test that we debated quite a bit about in the shuttle program and decided that the probability of getting in that situation probably didn't merit the test
i will add that there was a lot of good tension within the shuttle program up and down at all levels
i thought the whole management team was relatively cohesive but there was good tension
i mean we got the best out of everybody and arrived at the best answer by the balance that we had between the institutional managers
i mentioned the contribution i think that chris kraft made and bill lucas
i'd also add early on rocco petrone
and then the program managers
the john yardleys and bob thompsons and arnie aldridges
and then the so called level three which aaron and i were
i guess you were two
i think it was a well balanced management structure
and i'm not sure you have that today
today for whatever reason the program has gotten into an operational mindset
center directors are more viewed to keep the grass cut at the centers and that kind of thing
you don't have that tension
who is holding the program people in check
i see that missing
i always felt that there was another institutional side that had my hands cuffed at the right time
and so i think as nasa goes forward and maybe some of you folks that are going to have careers in the industry you ought to make sure that a you're surrounded by good people and that you're surrounded by a good system i mean a good system that pulls you up at the right time or calls you in check at the right time whatever you do
whether it's going back to the moon or mars or maybe in retrospect flying a shuttle a little bit more
here let me slow down and stop a minute now and see if there are any other areas that you all would like to cover
yes
we've talked in the past a lot about the slow kind of turnaround on the shuttle and part of that has been attributed to having to remove the engines and i'm not sure if it's overhauling them but basically taking them partly apart and looking at them and examining them
and i was wondering if that was part of the original plan or what kind of changed the efficiency of that turnaround time what caused it to change and slow down in the original plan
well the original plan was for fifty five missions on an engine
but that just didn't materialize at all once we saw what we had
i don't know what today's life on a set of bearings are but it's a handful of missions
you've got to tear down both of the high pressure pumps and replace a bearing
the same on turbine blades
you want to replace that stack after a few missions that are defined in a current certification program
it's certainly less than a half a dozen
and yes that has built in the time
but you could overcome that by just dropping the whole engine and replacing it with another one and doing it all in parallel
there were a lot of people on this program that i never envisioned you needed
i think nasa did the right thing by turning it over to a contractor or a team of contractors but they stayed too much involved so it was all done by a committee
i mean i don't want to pick on anybody but who was in charge
who felt they were really responsible for that accident
i couldn't see it and i followed it and could offer my opinion but i didn't sense that the program had somebody in charge
there was another one
yes
i was wondering if you could talk about any examples that you know where specific technologies that came out of the shuttle main engines have either been used or avoided in newer launch vehicles today
no i think a lot of the materials will certainly be carried forward
coatings seal technology that's probably one of the areas in the turbomachinery that i didn't talk about enough
there are a number of seals on those shafts that are very critical to the operation
and there was a lot of technology advancement made in the development of the ssme on seals
those would be several examples
yes
i was wondering if there was much discussion before the project started on the risks in going from seven hundred psi operating whether there was some option to go to an intermediate pressure
i am sure there probably was
again i came in the program about a year after it started so i was on a periphery of some of the early stuff
but i think the risk at that time more focused on nasa particularly at marshall
i think they wanted a liquid booster
eberhard greff the german felt very comfortable with liquid boosters because you could shut them off as opposed to the solids
but cost and other things i think they eventually became comfortable that the solids were fine
i think the risk tradeoff was more on the booster
you shut a liquid off
when you light those solids you're going somewhere
on the engine i know they knew it was going to be harder
i'm not sure they appreciated how hard it actually got to end up with those eight thousand psi pressures at the head of the pre burners and what that did to the rest of the system
and what it did to materials and what it did to crack growth rates and everything from then on
you wouldn't fly today without it
you understood the mechanism you applied fraction mechanics and then you applied several factors and then you certified that and that's where you went
does the aircraft industry do the same thing because they have turbine blades too that crack don't they
i'm really not sure
i don't want to fly on an airplane that has got a cracked blade
j_r you talked about the lack of testing nowadays compared to at the beginning of the program
to what extent does the fact that i mean after every flight they take the engines out and they borescope them and look at that
i mean does that to some extent constitute continual testing
no
what's the difference between that and what you get out of the tests
well i think probably
today's teams they go to the log book and they read what was written down by the last generation and that's what they inspect
that's fine and that's very thorough
but the testing the introduction of some kind of a small change by a mom and pop operation that i alluded to earlier that's what a test program will catch
some new problem that creeps in or will get caught that's not done there
no
let me say it another way
i believe it is very dangerous to execute this program in the way that i understand is planned to be executed between now and when they retire the shuttle
i think that's the most dangerous period in the life of the shuttle because of that
i mean the people that are in the program now have not been part of developing it
i don't know how many pictures they've seen of a lox pump that has burnt up
you just think about things differently once you've been exposed to that first hand that's my view of it
now how you transition out of a shuttle program onto something new i don't have that answer
i mean i think you've got to do both
like the wing walker i wouldn't let loose of a shuttle before i had something else in hand
and today they're going to let loose this and hope this other thing comes along
and i think there's some risk to that
along that line with the o ring issue and the foam issue do you think that those were never solved were never looked at because of lack of money or just confidence in the technology at the time
i mean the o ring was kind of carried over a little bit
the foam i don't know how much of that was brand new
and nowadays are we just relying on the confidence that these things have worked for a hundred mission or so or is it just lack of money
no i cannot say there was a lack of money back at the time of the o ring
had the culture been and if they were inquisitive enough to pursue it i think they could have gotten the money to do it
on the shuttle engine out of necessity the culture was there
i mean it was driven by people like yardley
i think another thing at nasa and aerospace you know you can do wonderful things with computers today but too little of all this analysis is anchored by a good failure
you've got the analysis you've got a lot of programs you can do a heck of a job on analysis today but it's not necessarily anchored in the remnants of a good failure one that has adequate data
if i'm building a test bed now how do i kind of intelligently justify it to my sponsors that i want to have a budget
well i don't think you're going to sell it that way
right
well i think your sponsor or whoever has got to have a good appreciation of how far you're going to be pushing the technology
if you oversell it then you're not going to get the money to be able to stand those
if you push too hard in that direction your sponsor is probably going to get disinterested
that's going to be a fine line
pick a current example
pick at least as i understand it what nasa is trying to do with the lunar project or the moon project
i for one think that their yardstick is going to be tough
apollo didn't have any failures why are you going to have any failure
i think they are going to have to be very careful how they sell that program
just because they're using or will use shuttle derived elements an external tank maybe a five or an additional segment to the solid motors the ssme that's not going to be a freebee
i mean i've already told you i would do some things to the shuttle main engine in building a different program
the tank you know they're not going to keep the foam from coming off on the configuration that they have
and i also wouldn't assume that i don't have a problem now because i don't have an orbiter on the side of it
the foam is not supposed to come off
i would degrade the insulation and put on something that would stay as an example
yes
how much of the original engine the current engine right now is it exactly the same as the original one or what has changed
materials
is the computer the same
is everything exactly the same
i think it is the same
i'm sure there are through engineering change proposals or fairly low level change traffic some things that have been upgraded
but inconel is still the basic material of the housing
the turbine blades are still mar m two hundred forty six which is a high strength copper i think
that's the same thing
they still use ball bearings when they fly
and i don't know the change point on this but pratt and whitney makes the high pressure turbo pumps now and they used roller bearings
and that would be a big change the two high pressure pumps that have now been incorporated in the shuttle engine
but other areas
the high pressure turbo pumps
yeah
at some point a couple of years ago i think they were incorporated and brought in
those would be big part number changes
but a lot of other areas of the engine i think it's the same
and i think that's one of the reasons that they feel they don't need to test much
they've got all that
so we will have to see how the next four or five years play out
anything else
well since they're talking about using a lot of these with the next generation vehicle and they won't be reusable what can be done
i mean what's the way to go about kind of de rating the shuttle
you talked about opening the throat but all the other things that make the engine reusable and presumably make it more expensive
will it really be the same engine when they get finished
i mean what has to be done
i don't know
i mean some may argue and suppose because the requirement for reusable engine isn't there will eliminate some of the things
i don't know what they'd be
but having paid all that development i would be more inclined to really minimize the change for change sake and do some things like open up the throat
i mentioned that as an example that would reduce the operating pressures and i think give them more margin across the board
on a tank i would go to an installation system that is going to be a little less efficient
you're going to have more boil off weigh a lot more but something that doesn't give you other problems
j_r let me ask a question that was asked of me and i couldn't answer earlier
did we ever look at putting the insulation internal to the external tank rather than the outside
i'm not aware that it was looked at
somebody along the way i suspect could have
no i'm not aware of what it was or what it would have been
anything else
well i've enjoyed it
i hope you don't repeat the same mistakes that we made this time around
and good luck in your projects
thanks j_r i'm just going to take the last three minutes
j_r referred to the fact that we only had one engine shut down in the whole history of the program
and that was due to a sensor
just to give you a sense of what goes into the operation of this system
it was always recognized that you have sensors looking at the temperatures
and the idea is that if anything starts to go wrong with the engine you want to shut it down now before the thing blows up
because we can lose one engine and have an intact abort but if the engine blows up and takes the whole boat tail with it you're not going to get back
generally there's a little switch in the cockpit which enables the ability of the sensors to shut down the engines and you fly with that on
but the problem is if you lose one engine and you get into an abort mode now at least for the first part of that abort mode if you lose a second engine now with only one engine remaining you cannot complete an intact abort
what the crew does if you lose an engine you take that switch and you disable the automatic shutdown
well what happened was a few minutes into the launch the sensor started to go off scale
the engine was shutdown
but they were far enough into the launch that they can actually do an abort to orbit
they took the engine switch to disable normal procedure
when they got a little further along so that they were in what they would be able to a little further on i forget the exact details but they took the switch back to enable
but the main engine flight controller on the ground noticed that the sensor in one of the other engines was also starting to go off scale
and if that was allowed it would basically take down a second engine
that would have put them in a single engine what we would have called an intact transatlantic abort
but by that time they were too far to land in the normal abort site and they would have ended up landing somewhere in africa i think in the dark
i mean it would have been a really bad situation
and so the flight controller was sharp enough to tell the flight director we've got another bad sensor tell the crew to take the switch to inhibit
luckily the flight director's background was in propulsion systems
he knew exactly what the flight controller was talking about
they called it up to the crew they took it and so the second engine did not shut down
and in fact they made it into orbit and they managed to complete the mission
but these are decisions which have to be made in split seconds
in fact the flight controller who made that call was given a special award from nasa
you really have to know these systems inside and out
and that is of course why we have so many simulations where they run those sorts of failure cases so that people are able to make these decisions very quickly in real time
and that basically saved the shuttle and the crew from potentially a really bad situation
is the orbit burn done by the main engines
no they're done by the oms
once the main engines shut down you've dropped the tank so you don't have any more propellant
and there have been a few i think four engine shutdowns on the pad
you start the engines about six seconds before t zero
that gives them enough time to come up to full operating performance so that you can check out that they are ok
remember we talked about the twang because of the asymmetric thrust that gives you enough time for the orbiter to tilt forward and then come back
and then when you're vertical that is when you fire the engines
i've got some pictures of this
at one class i will show you some slow motion pictures of the launch
you can see all that
we've had four pad shutdowns
of those two were due to real problems with the engine and two were due to instrumentation problems
it's always a problem of how much instrumentation do you put in and how much do you trust it
and i know aaron has made the point on several occasions of if you put an abort system in for the crew is that going to be triggered automatically or does it have to be manual
you certainly don't want to get shot off the end of a good working rocket just because your sensors have told you that something wrong is happening
there are a lot of interesting engineering decisions to be made with that
end of class
we'll see you on thursday
we're about ready to get started
a couple things
first of all this is for those of you who are working on gn and c for your projects
i have spoken with phil hattis from draper lab who is going to be giving the lecture on gn and c but he is not giving the lecture until the third of november
now that is kind of late
and so i asked him if he would be willing to meet with all of you who are working on gn and c just so you could talk with him and ask questions
if you want him to give you a short version of his presentation that he's going to give in november he can do that
but he is our in house resident expert
and i figured it's better if you get a chance to talk to him early
he has some time free tomorrow and he has some time next week
he is out of town through today
i know we have two teams working on gn and c
if you guys want to get together and find out if there is some time when you could all meet with phil i will give you his contact information
he says he is happy to do it
it would be much more convenient from his point of view if you could all see him at the same time and talk about it together
let me know what you come up with
but as i say he is happy to do it
second thing
there was an interview printed in us today which i have posted on the class website with mike griffin the administrator
and it says nasa administrator says space shuttle was a mistake
and so the question was what do we intend to do about that in this class
well let me actually read the specific words that griffin uses because i think that's important
griffin said my opinion is that the shuttle was a design which was extremely aggressive and just barely possible
and that's actually i think a slightly different way of looking at this
i mean i would also say that apollo was a project that was extremely aggressive and just barely possible
and i think that it is actually nasa's business to do things which are aggressive and just barely possible
now whether it was the right decision for the country to abandon the exploration program after apollo and do the shuttle and then later on the space station that's more i think in the political realm
and as i think you've heard both from dale myers and john logsdon that in fact there were political determining factors which didn't really give nasa a lot of choice
just to remind you the basic point of this course is not the political and economic history of the shuttle
it's a technical exploration of how we did the shuttle
i think we would all agree that the concept of the shuttle was extremely aggressive and the technology was being stretched and it was just barely possible
and yet we did it
and the idea of this course is to understand how we did it and how the systems work
i think it will be interesting when we get towards the end of the course maybe we'll sit down and relax and instead of having i think there are two kinds of open sessions towards the end that i've been thinking about what we want to do there
and in one of them i think we may just talk a little bit and reflect on what we've learned and that will give us an opportunity to discuss issues like this
that's all i'm going to say about this
i don't propose that we discuss this further today because we really are fortunate to have bass redd
and aaron cohen is going to introduce him formally
i will just say that when i was at johnston space center last spring and i met one of the older managers there and i was telling him about our plans for this course and how aaron was going to be a visiting professor here and we were inviting some of the experts in the early design of the shuttle he said well there is one guy you absolutely have to get and that's bass redd
well we've got him
we're very fortunate
and aaron i will turn it over to you and let you explain a little bit more why we're so fortunate
well first i have to tell you how i found bass
i had a hard time finding bass
he lives in a placed called smithville texas
and when people ask him where smithville texas is he said it's about a few minutes after you pass resume speed
so it's not a very well known place
but i finally found bass
and he is truly an outstanding aerodynamicist
and the thing that is so important is that aerodynamics to me from my vantage point is really the linchpin you might say of putting a system together
aerodynamics makes the system come alive
and as you could hear from the various speakers from tom moser and we talked a little bit about the guidance navigation and control it's important for the structures
aerodynamics is important for the structures it's important for the flight control system it's important for the hydraulic system and it's important for the heating system
so you have to understand the aerodynamics before you can make the vehicle actually come alive
and bass redd is the man to do it
he is absolutely one of the great aerodynamicists of our times
and he started out before there was computational fluid dynamics and the old wind tunnel testing
and now there is computational fluid dynamics so you're going to be in for a real treat today to hear how bass redd put both the apollo together he did the apollo aerodynamics and he also did the shuttle aerodynamics
and he is also now consulting to help nasa do their future work
let me now turn it over to bass
thank you aaron
it's a great honor to be with you this morning
and you sure do look young
we will try to cover basically and with that overview then of the orbiter is how the program requirements drove the aerodynamic configuration probably the biggest thing in what the aerodynamic characteristics are driven by the program requirements
and that will make a little more sense after we get into the briefing
then the aerodynamic considerations those that aren't due to program requirements but just due to the basic fundamentals of aerodynamics and the configuration that is being evaluated
we will do that for both the orbiter and the integrated vehicle
then i'll try to tell you how the aerodynamic design was accomplished through each of those phases a lot of ways to work problems
early on having powerful tools or sometimes a curse to you because you can produce more data than the system can consume
and i remember when we first got started on the shuttle design the people from structures had just finished the nastran on the apollo and they immediately wanted enough data to put into the nastran for every configuration that was being conceived
that's not really a smart thing to do when you have literally hundreds of configurations to be considered
we will try to talk to you about phases phase a b and c and defining the problem areas
and then defining the aerodynamic characteristics and do just a quick summary of the wind tunnel test program
and with some comments on how cfd might have driven that were it available
through the sixty s and eighty s these design studies were accomplished in phases
phase a is primarily in house civil service design
i don't know how well you understand the nasa part what the contractor part what the civil service part is but phase a is primarily in house civil service
whenever the contractors began to feel that this might be a real program they began to do their in house studies and they began to visit and give us recommendations and ideas on their own to drive that
none of that is paid for
that's a gratuitous kind of a thing
and contractors have a bit of change set aside to do those kinds of studies but it's a freebee and really a super way to do things
and that's still going on today
phase b is then you give contracts for generic studies
scopes out the concept feasibilities and the program requirements and does those trades does projected cost and timelines
by the way before i forget it humboldt mandell on costing would be excellent
we worked quite close hand in hand on trying to get those requirements and cost run together along with the weight
nasa then after they get through this phase b they produce a detailed statement of work that is required for the phase c and d
and then phase c and d is the design and development
the air force separated those two
nasa always sort of put those together
so the design development and construction
and the contractors do the detail work
nasa manages and checks it
usually the way we operate at least in our area the aerodynamic area we had a crack team that would go back in and define the problem a potential solution to that problem and then suggest to the contractor they might look at this way or that way
but they really put the muscle to it
they put the final studies
they have the design documentation
and we try to steer that train as those things happen
in the shuttle now phase a we started in one thousand nine hundred sixty nine just shortly after the lunar landing they put together a small team
and this is at johnson space craft center
and that's through my knothole and the way that i look at things
but we did end up being the lead center in the shuttle
but we started with a small e and d group that was headed by a fellow by the name of jim chamberlain
jim chamberlain was the one that was responsible for the gemini space craft a very unique individual gone to heaven to be with the lord now reviewed by max faget who was head of e and d and bob gilruth who was center director but that was a real privilege to work with him
what came out of that initial phase a study is what the vehicle should be is a small personnel vehicle with a four man crew ten k payload landing on the runway with about two hundred nautical miles cross range
quite different from the shuttle that we have today but that was during the phase a
strong design modules in this time were developed
and showing how the other program requirements go with the design the size and the program cost there were individuals who had in their databank which consisted of books that they kept on their tables were all of the aircraft all of the spacecraft all of the missiles what the weight of every individual subsystem was based upon plots with ecls's on how much heat they took out on the avionics as to how many computations they made
well not to chase that rabbit too far but basically they were down to the subsystem kind of level
and then with the primary structure secondary structure how that was affected by landed weights or entry weights the thermal protection system
and it was amazing what a good job that kind of approach would do
and then we had point designs that were being looked at both in house at johnson space craft center at marshall and by all the contractors
and then all that data was fed into the system
so that was a designed database
some of those have been automated now and pretty good
and they don't give you the right answers but the answers they give you aren't very far wrong either
they get into the ballpark for you
phase b started in one thousand nine hundred seventy one
something happened
the requirements were not dictated by nasa
the requirements were dictated by the air force at least the driving requirements
if we had our own a small vehicle it would have satisfied that
the air force requirements were fifty five thousand pound payload sixty foot long payload bay fifteen foot in diameter it had to be returned with a one thousand two hundred nautical mile cross range
at least thirty two thousand pounds of it had to be returned
it was classified at that time
it is no longer classified
you can use your imagination to figure out what kind of payload that you would want to go up into a high inclination orbit and bring back in one pass
where that would take you and why you'd have to get back that quickly
but those were the requirements that were fed into phase b
maximum reusability did not come from the air force
that came from the nasa side as that was part of technology
nasa has two basic jobs to do
one is the design of the vehicle the delivering of the hardware accomplishing the mission but the other requirement for nasa is that it increased the technology
going where no man has gone before yes but doing things that man has not done before in a better faster way
and so maximum reusability was a goal that the engineers were handed
soft ride
they wanted to be able to a congressman or a senator up in it
a neat thing
multi center participation
if you ever get hum up here that cost you
any time you break a job down and give it to more than one center or more than one contractor it's like humpty dumpty you break him apart you've got to put him back together again
and it takes a lot of eyes and elbows on both sides to accomplish that
and basically once you break something down you've increased your cost by thirty percents to forty percents to put it back together again
now nasa has to have under congressional mandate contracts in every state in the union
multi center participation drives a great number of things so i felt it needed to be on the chart
but the big thing that you need to know as engineers sometimes you cannot set your own program requirements
they are dictated to you for strange reasons
and you have to play the hand that you're dealt
phase c and d we had four contractors that bid on phase c and d
the interesting thing is rockwell was the only contractor that bid within the allocated funds
they also had the best proposal but that was very interesting
what they did was use the aerodynamic database that was developed in phase a and in phase b for their design analysis
they augmented that they did some in house testing and rockwell said we can do it for that amount of money but only if you don't change anything nasa
and we changed things
they had a smaller orbiter and we rejected that very early on
it had no capability for weight growth
and we showed that every program that has ever existed grew in weight by at least five percents ten percents fifteen percents
and so the orbiter was sized up just a little bit larger than the one that they had proposed with their agreement
aaron probably had a contract change authorization because of that
but anyway we did that right at the beginning
what we did also aerodynamically during that phase b is we developed a complete database in the nation's best facility to be used for what we call verification analysis
and that database is very well documented and we will talk about that a little bit more
program requirements
may i ask before you go onto program requirements could you say something about kind of you talked about the aerodynamic database but nowadays we've got a lot of information about hypersonic aerodynamics
can you say a little bit about the state of the art
what did people really know
yeah
as a matter of fact i'm going to do that when we go through it by phases specifically
i'm kind of telling it to you like a mystery story
the program requirements dictated the basic orbiter configuration payload size crew size and returning the payload bay the engine
now if you just visualize in your mind and it's kind of a two chart thing let me just jump over to that since i know how to go back now
if you've got a payload that's got to be that long and you've got a crew size and the crew takes at least one telephone booth's worth of volume per crew takes at least one telephone booths worth of volume per crew even superman needed something that big
you've got the volume of this
engines in the back
you want to return that because engines are very very expensive
the avionics of course you want to bring those back
they are very very expensive
and you've got to have it pointy end first
you looked at that and said boy you didn't have much choice as far as the fuselage was concerned
and that's right you really don't
now that's pretty well set
now the wing size is required to augment the body lift
now if you just had the body on there it would have to land about three hundred knots
we didn't have wheel tires and breaks to land at that those speeds so we had to have some more lift
and that was accommodated with a wing
figure out what cl max is
they're all about the same
you like a delta wing because it's a little more nice from a heat transfer standpoint
sure a whole lot nicer if you've got to go through supersonic and transonic conditions at low angles of attack
so you've got a delta wing that you want to have on there
you don't have much choice on the size of that
airflow by the way twelve percents thick
that makes it nice for the structures people
still does a super job aerodynamically too
and so that's pretty well dictated
then the entry angle of attack is dictated by the hypersonic l d required for the cross range
and you can go through your equations newtonian aerodynamics sign or the exposed area and the then l d the tangents
and so you've got the hypersonic aerodynamics from that angle of attack required for the cross range
the wing shape to balance the configuration for the aft cg and acceptable wing leading edge heating
in other words we can position that wing at the right place for the center of gravity that we have which by the way even in phase a is known pretty well didn't change much
the control services was the magic thing
with the payload in and out one point five percents cg changed
there has only been one other aerodynamic vehicle that has ever been built that has a cg of one point five percents of body length
that was a b thirty six
and this vehicle had to have the one point five percents change in the center of gravity because of payload in payload out
and you can try to stack it together in many different ways
that's just as good as you can do
that dictated the size of the control services to accommodate that
they are very big
they are barn doors
it makes it nice for controlling the vehicle
oh and the vertical tail we'll talk about that
that's for crosswind landings
but the way most all the vehicles that you've seen from overseas that have been proposed cannot land in a crosswind
i don't know what they are going to do
they don't have enough control service to land in the crosswind
but that dictated the vertical tail size
now as you kind of go around the loop on those things some potential items that we probably want to point out here is the body shape
we've already basically talked about it
nose shape that's pretty straight forward
the basic orbiter shape didn't really change from phase a through phase c and d
we blended the oms pot a little bit because we didn't want it to interfere with the payload bay door which was built by a different set of groups
the delta wing we put a little crank in it a double delta and got a little more subsonic lift
and we didn't have the body flap moving to start with but we found that it was a very powerful control of which assisted the center of gravity movement
the full spanned elevons were needed to control the center of pressure for hypersonics
and there are other little things there and you can read those through at your convenience but those are just basic things that you have to do
and we will comment on some of those a little bit later
the integrated vehicle the launch vehicle if you please what do the program requirements do to it
well the orbiter was sized for that payload bay weight
it had to land
it had to enter
we knew the weights pretty well
the one hundred fifty k pound orbiter the sixty five k pound payload dictated the requirements of the orbiter injected weight
you add them up
you've got to get it into orbit
once around at the high inclination and return to the launch site set the orbiter performance requirements
we had to have a certain amount of energy available from the propulsion system
maximum hardware reusability mixed with a cost consideration yielded a stage and a half vehicle
and i will talk to you about that in just a minute
but the cost constraints there was a great move afoot to have a return to the launch site booster manned booster if you please but the cost and constraints and the size of the vehicle got pretty big
the wing vehicle loads were significantly reduced by the parallel burn
you've got the orbiter tucked in between the solid rocket boosters and the external tank versus an orbiter that would be on the end
it makes a great difference in the structural loads that the aerodynamics produces
solid rocket booster mismatch decreased or dictated an increased beta dispersion
typically on an end to end vehicle you've got everything kind of tucked in pretty tightly
on this one the srbs are spread any mismatch at burnout and we had some big beta dispersions that still haunt us a little bit today
soft ride requirement
yes i'm sorry
i just don't know what a beta dispersion is
you don't know what a beta dispersion is
all right
angle of attack
angle the size of it beta
alpha beta standard aerodynamic definition
which by the way brings me to a comment
we've been asked to chase a rabbit with you here
i would suggest very highly that you get yourself a nasa dictionary where standard terms that your bosses will use because they've been using them for years
that you do that
and i'm not fussing at you at all
you can get a little gray book that's called the nasa dictionary
and you will know what alpha and betas are
cmq plus cm alpha dots
all those standards terms are defined
flutter
buffet
and you will really look sharp when you know what he's saying
all right
go ahead
i know there are some people here who didn't go through aero astro and so may have actually not had a full course in aerodynamics
hopefully most of you have had it
but any time there are expressions or terms you don't understand just do ask and we'll bring you up to speed
and that nasa dictionary by the way covers not just aerodynamics
it covers all kinds of other vocabulary kinds of things that your peers will be using and your supervisors will be using and you will know what they're talking about
soft ride requirements that caused us to go to a real low dynamic pressure which is nice
most vehicles are up around one thousand two hundred pounds per square foot dynamic pressure
this one is down around eight hundred
and the reason that came about is lesser g loads early on
srb flare angle no big deal there
plume effects have really ate up aerodynamics
to this day that is the only thing aerodynamically that we still don't know how to predict or the base pressure due to plume effects through the subsonic and supersonic speed regime
cfd gets it right every now and then
sometimes it doesn't get it right
and the wind tunnel test still hadn't got it right with solid plumes
all the scaling parameters that you use still don't produce to me what a real valid answer is
the flight data is used and we update that
yes sir
when you say flare angle do you mean like in the stack away from the orbiter
yes sir
this flare angle right back here
we found that if you set that right it pretty well sets the flow and the plumes behave themselves
if you set that too small the plumes will change greatly with mach numbers sometimes in an unpredictable fashion so that srb skirt size was primarily from that consideration
this is real precious to aaron's heart
we changed the tank shape early in phase c and d
and remember i told you that we had developed a database during phase b that would suffice and we could go immediately into the design and development of the total stack
by the way i like the ogive
it's a lot prettier than the cone that we had on the front end
but basically what that did that changed the aerodynamics of the whole stack
and the data that was delivered to structure for their structural analysis the data that was delivered to the heating people for their heat transfer analysis had to be done all over again
that's a year and a half cycle from the time you say let's go build a model let's get the data let's analyze it
the other thing that happened when we changed the tank everybody took note of that and there are all kinds of other small changes that jumped on
on the orbiter a little bit on the external tank on the srbs and on the inclination that we had between the orbiter and the tank
let me just hit some things i think that you want to take note of on this one
i guess the nose shape we mentioned that one already reduces the drag
it also reduces the loads
we have to worry about the punch loads between the srb and the tank
and those aerodynamics are driven quite a bit by that nose shape
the srb locations fore and aft there is some adjustment that you can have in that and those are all optimized that whenever we do the aerodynamics that puts a minimum amount of load into the system
orbiter instance angle that's the angle between the orbiter and the external tank
it drives the stability of the configuration to some degree
but more than that it drove the loads quite a bit into the program
and that was optimized
full span elevators we use those to adjust the pitching moments so we get minimum change required to trim the vehicle from the srbs solid rocket boosters and the ssmes the main shuttle engines
ssme plume effects and the plume effects from the srb that's the only thing that we got a bad grade on as far as predicting aerodynamics on either the orbiter or the integrated vehicle
all the rest of the stuff came out just about as we had predicted
now getting back to where you asked the question
phase a
go back now
what is a phase a
that is the conceptual design
we had all kinds of configurations because we had all kinds of requirements
we really didn't know what those were and so that analysis had to be done
many many vehicles
a lot of considerations
the analytical techniques we used to identify problem areas
hypersonics quite frankly in phase a
newtonian vehicle shape was approximated with flat plates
works great on a configuration
that's pretty much like a vehicle that is kind of trimmed out of a piece of a sphere if you please
and those aerodynamic characteristics were very good
as a matter of fact the thing is laid out on graph paper and you counted the squares and saw where the cg was and what things had to be
and it worked
it worked
now we didn't know that it was working at that time
but we found out later that it did
but that's what we used
nasa documentation
nasa had pretty good tns on vehicles that were somewhat similar
and the characteristics of those we made the adjustments because of the difference in configuration
the air force had a document called dataman
it was unpublished at that time but we got a preliminary draft that we worked through by hand
by the way this is a published thing
i would suggest very highly if aerodynamics is going to be your forte is that you learn how to use that program
it's dataman aerodynamics handbook
navel ordinance had a handbook out
they've never computerized theirs but it's the handbook of supersonic aerodynamics and good old horner's fluid dynamics lift and drag
it is still around today still use it but those were the aerodynamic methods that we used during phase day
and we also did small scale wind tunnel tests and those things that were the problem areas
and the problem areas were primarily in the transition
yes sir
i can understand how you can do wind tunnel testing
what about plume effects
you said you didn't understand those
how do you test that experimentally
no that's done in a wind tunnel
some people said you need to match momentum on a scale vehicle
certain other characteristics
what you'd like to do is be able to simulate it with a solid plume so we did solid plume testing
we had method of characteristics back then
it took it about three weeks to run to get the plume sizes and they did a pretty good job
but when you have the plume sizes you still after the base effects change in the pitching moment
and so we did the solid plumes
and we did gaseous plumes at ames research center
we did cold gas and hot gas
but none of those met all the scaling parameters
when you rolled all that up and you did the best you could we still missed base pressure
base pressure was missed on saturn five
base pressure was missed on mercury
base pressure was missed on little joe ii and little joe i
every launch vehicle that i could find we missed base pressure on
we missed base pressure on the shuttle also
not a big effect but it is embarrassing that you cannot get it right
but this was done primarily more in phase c and d than in the phase a time period
we just kind of said plumes are going to be about that much based upon data from other vehicles
and then making sure that it was not a design driver or design stopper if you please that it wasn't going to be a problem that was so big that it changed things so greatly that your performance wasn't adequate
and we had margins and everything
anyway we did some small scale testing
phase b
what did we do on the shuttle on phase b
we went into phase b with four major configurations
three externally identical configurations with swing wings
it was called the triamese
and i think general dynamics was the one that proposed that one
they have all bought on another and it's hard to find out who is who any longer
but anyway that was one of the concepts
very very expensive
the swing wings never really solved those problems
lockheed had a large single stage blended body kind of an hl ten looking thing with a flat bottom and then with a large external tank around
and i couldn't find pictures of all this to show you but that was one that came in
and then the two stage fully reusable with both the first and the second stages being runway landers a very favorite of marshall
and then the one that we called the stage and a half where you're literally burning the first stage boosters and the second stage engines at the same time with the external tank we referred to that as a stage and a half with parallel burn which is the current shuttle
but those are the things that we started phase b in and did aerodynamic designs on all those
how did we do that
well we had gotten a little smarter
a lot of the newtonian programs had now been automated
it was still pretty much a flat plate kind of a program though were you divided the vehicle up into a number of flat plates
and then there was some contractor in house wind tunnel test
nasa did some limited tests on potential problem areas post phase b and pre phase c and d
that was a gap between the time we put out an rfp request for proposal and the time that the contractors came back with a proposal
we had narrowed it down that it would be a stage and a half
that would be what we would write the rfp for
we developed a large wind tunnel test program developed a full aerodynamic database and heating database for that shuttle that was there at that time that was delivered to the contractors that were going to bid on that
integrated vehicle
we used the usf stability and control datcom
some contractor wind tunnel tests were done and limited nasa testing and analysis for potential problem areas
and also we did a post phase b full aerodynamic database for that vehicle
now with that what we're trying to do is eliminate configuration changes if at all possible
and we accomplished that to some degree but the change to the tank and other changes came back in that caused us some delay
but it was minimized
phase c and d configuration was baseline
a big word here make work changes only
nothing has changed because it looks better works better
you've got to change it or it will crash
that's what we said
that's not what we did
we made some changes because they were nice
theoretical aerodynamic techniques were employed to ensure you never get to test the right reynolds number
henceforth your boundary layer is a little bit wrong
plume effects they've got to be corrected
so there was a lot of analytical work that was done during that phase c and d
let me say this
that area of our technology was really improved
a lot of dollars that went into that aaron's courtesy that the program probably didn't need to fly the shuttle
now i tell him
i didn't tell him back then you're right
but for the benefit of technology we did that
we pumped great money into cfd great money into method of characteristics
a lot of money into other techniques that were there
and once more nasa goal was not only to do that mission but to help technology
and the reason you can do cfd today was because the dollars that the shuttle program pumped into that
had they not pumped that in you would still be adding up flat plates
aerodynamic variations and uncertainty were developed for all aerodynamic coefficients
no other vehicle had really done that
you sort of did the best that you could and said these are my aerodynamics
this is my normal force versus angle of attack
this is my side force coefficients yawing moment coefficients versus beta
and that said you would analyze that give that to the flight control system give that to the structures people and they would put their margins of safety in and look at it
we were quite concerned on this vehicle especially when it starts out at a forty five degree angle of attack
and sometimes during the supersonic and transonic regime it transists down to a low angle of attack
flow is separated
some place in there it reattaches
it cannot always make up its mind
you've got to be able to control the vehicle even though we weren't intentionally maneuvering at that time
and so we developed these variations
if you go back in the tunnel three times you get what
four different answers
and they're all very very close
if you change facilities you get slightly different answers
we had some reynolds level boundary layer kinds of problems between the wind tunnel and the full scale
and so these uncertainties were developed for all the aerodynamic coefficients
then this data was delivered to the gn and c people where they make for sure that they can fly their system with the uncertainties
the cn betas yawing moment coefficient with angle of side slip the control moment coefficients
the delta yawing moments and rolling moments due to elevon maneuvers where the errors on those that the control system wouldn't go berserk with any combination of those
the same with structures and with flight dynamics
now we're not living with those today
we did flight tests to reduce the variations
the astronauts put in pti pilot test inputs where they would do it a certain way and we would pre predict those characteristics
then we'd look at them post flight
we would pull the aerodynamic characteristics out with regression analysis techniques to say this is the aerodynamic coefficients that had to be there for that maneuver to look like it looked
that within itself has some plus or minus stuff because you can change stuff a little bit and it still looks pretty good
those two then were combined and we had a set of reduced aerodynamics
but today when you go to the aerodynamic data book which we hope to be able to get you copies of it will have not only the coefficients for all mach numbers angles of attack angle to slide slip it will tell you what the uncertainty as a function of mach number angle of attack is for that
and your system should be able to work with all those
i want to mention this aerodynamic design substantiation report
you won't be able to get a copy of that any place that i know of but we're going to try to get a copy to jeff for you and it should be available in your files
but what that did that goes back in and for every coefficient every angle of attack
how we arrived at that specific value and those specific variations using both wind tunnel and flight test
a super document
not pretty but an excellent technical document
and that was done during the flight test program and afterwards
i thought we would stick up there the wind tunnel testing program
that's primarily the backbone of the aerodynamic database of the shuttle both for the orbiter and the integrated vehicle one hundred forty nine entry tests on the entry vehicle seventy nine heating forty structural
you can add them up
hours of wind tunnel test time seventeen point zero
aaron asked me how that compared with the apollo
as best i remember we did about four thousand to five thousand hours on the entry vehicle on apollo
however apollo didn't have all of those moveable surfaces
moveable surfaces are nice do a lot of things for you but you've got to test and make sure they're there
and those were through various wind tunnels throughout the country
yes sir
these were the best facilities in the country
do they still exist
far up and away yes sir they still exist
the ones at ames are still usable
the ones at aedc are still usable
unfortunately those at langley even though they're there and they work because of funding constraints langley has a hard time bringing them up and using them
and that's unfortunate because they have some excellent facilities there
and we surely used them
in this wind tunnel test program you can find out in a special wind tunnel testing program summary
by the way you can get this document pretty straightforwardly
ascent vehicle
a few less hours and that's because you don't move as many surfaces primarily
heating
that's something to work on
if you want a good project to work on how do you take heating data in a wind tunnel on a small scale vehicle and make full scale predictions
the reason that's near and dear to my heart they ran a test not too long ago and they still cannot match those two
a good phd thesis
maybe you can figure out how to do that and how to do it right
a lot of scaling parameters that are used kind of like plumes
you're not sure which scaling parameter really works but there is slide test data calorimeters and there is fly test data and wind tunnel data
it doesn't bother us that much because we've got enough conservatism in the system and uncertainties that we know we're safe to fly but it does hurt your pride when you said hey that heating rate should be nine btu's per foot squared per second and the fly test data said it's not but two
you might look good one way you look bad another way but if i was looking for something to get my plow into and i was interested in theoretical stuff that's probably what i'd pick
total wind tunnel test program aaron paid for that out of his budget by the way
it was less than dollars one hundred million
in those year dollars
but it was an excellent program
every test that was conducted was documented analyzed and we can make that available
that concludes the things that i had to tell you
and we hit that hour just about right
do you have any questions that you'd like to ask
if not i'll give you a test
yes sir
how do we affect the trim
hypersonics and when i say hypersonic let me take it down to mach five was probably the best at prediction that we had
a flat plate which the belly of the orbiter has a little bit of surface bending both in the pitch plane and in the yaw plane for stability
if you put a big sphere or segment of a sphere you could place the orbiter on that and you'd say hey
and i know a sphere or segment of a sphere has stability
now the uncertainties turn out not to be in normal forces or in even side forces
pitching moment is the one that you tend to miss the most
and sometimes you don't know if you have a wrong pitching moment or a wrong center of gravity
they both precipitate a delta pitching moment coefficient change
the big barn doors we have that into the system where we control not only a rate control system but an attitude control system
and so it takes with a seventy square foot it just takes a small amount of change to correct any error that you might have in either cgr pitching moment
your control mechanism is with the big elevators and also the body flap a little bit if you want to use that
the reaction control system is a rate system
and i didn't mention that
and we intentionally put the reaction control system in the wake of the vehicle even though for orbital maneuvering we have jets that are the forward firing end
but so much uncertainty in how that changes the aerodynamics in a surface that is not a hard surface
and that interaction you can change things in such a way that you amplify it or reduce it
and so we elected not to try to grapple with that problem and use just the aft jets but it's just for a rate control system
end pitch that's the distance that separated that and yaw on both sides and in roll
x fifteen was a low angle of attack airplane type configuration from mach twenty five to mach five
you're flying a spacecraft kind of configuration where you basically roll about the velocity vector
you want to maintain that pitch trim and roll about the velocity vector for cross range in either direction
now when you begin transition because you've got to be down here when you're landing you pick the best place to do that
and the best place to do that is back in the mach below five and of course above the subsonic regime
and we try not to have any maneuvers that are required during that time period
any time you're going from a totally separated flow on the back of the vehicle to one that is now attached separated flow cannot make its mind sometimes
does it want to be separated
does it want to be attached
not only the whole vehicle but even on small pieces of the vehicle
and so there are uncertainties that come in there
but that's the area
but you've got to be sure
and that's where we did a lot of our ptis by the way as we became more and more brave to get those coefficients
and the wind tunnel did a pretty good job on them
yes
what you're doing is changing the newtonian flow now on my flat plate seventy square foot per surface
you mean the rear end
the rear end the big end yeah
now i've got a normal force coefficient sine squared to the angle
then i just change the angle up and reduce the forces on that and that gives me a nose up
i bring it down
that gives me a nose down
it works beautifully
this is the body flap we're talking about
body flap and elevators yeah both
body flap and aft control surfaces
yes sir
you talked about the flight test portion of the aerodynamics
what sort of planes were you using to do that
the flight test was the shuttle itself
after we safely entered and everything then we designed these pilot test inputs to extract aerodynamic characteristics
the same technique that edwards developed
and they did develop that by the way on the x fifteen and on other vehicles too
and we used that same technique
we sent one of our men out and he spent about almost a half a year learning all their techniques brought that back developed that and worked with the astronauts very very closely
they trained for those maneuvers
we extracted data for those maneuvers
we would change the aerodynamic characteristics and not tell them what they are in the simulators
and made sure that we didn't get any difficulty and made sure that the aero people could extract that data right and tell us how we changed it
they all got good as
and it worked very very well
no sir
we did that one
that was for the approach and landing test
but for the entry vehicle no those were supersonic
yes and we did hypersonic
we're talking about tests that were done during the flights
the first four flights were designated orbital flight tests
and i think the ptis actually continued well after that
yes
actually what this has given us in terms of a hypersonic database for a winged vehicle is incredible
at first they were called pilot test inputs because the pilots were doing them automatically
and then i remember some of the pilots were saying you've got to do it very precisely and so we really have got to be concentrating on that
and there are so many other things we have to concentrate on
could we possibly computerize this
and so i don't remember which flight they started doing that but at that point the ptis became known as the program test inputs rather than the pilot test inputs
you basically put in a little pitch up pitch down and see how it affected the roll and the yaw and all these cross coupling things at lots of different mach numbers
and over the course of a bunch of different flights and a lot of different ptis it really built up the aerodynamic coefficients at all these different mach numbers
you might say a little bit about how we collected hypersonic test data in wind tunnels
i mean it's not like you can just have a fan going and produce a mach twenty airflow for twenty minutes and you can play with your little thing
hypersonic testing was done primarily at the ames research center three and a half foot facility
we also did some up at calspan also used some of the langley facilities but the real workhorse was this three and a half foot hypersonic tunnel
and basically you would have the air coming through the tunnel at the required conditions
you would put the model of the vehicle which is usually a one point five percents to three percents model in the facility
you have what is called a six component balance that fits into the model
that is a strain gauge relationship
it gives you force and moments in both directions or forces in both directions and some difference between the gauges so you can pull the pitching moments and the yawing moments and the rolling moments out of that
you reduce it based primarily upon dynamic pressure or you say cn is equal to the normal force divided by qs the dynamic pressure times a reference area
standard aerodynamics but once more a language kind of thing where if you're in gas dynamics and not aerodynamics sometimes you don't get back over to those coefficients
by the way in that same document all of those terms are defined pretty well
but you measure those with a balance
then the question happens well i wasn't at full scale reynolds number
and then that's where you come up with your theoretical techniques
and you come back in and you look at it and you see that the boundary layer and the reynolds number corrections theoretically make a very little bit of difference
and then you go through today the cfd programs
you say it gets about the same answer
you go back to the flight test data and it gets about the same answer
basically what you conclude is wind tunnels do a super job hypersonically for this kind of a configuration
now it did good on the apollo it did good on the gemini it did good on the mercury and it did good on the shuttle
give me that configuration and i'll tell you what the hypersonic aerodynamic characteristics are
i can tell you in phase a and it's not going to be too much different at the end of phase b
and maybe you don't want to hear that because maybe you were going to do great things in the hypersonic area
but on a blunt body which is what we're talking about it does a super job now
x fifteen low angles of attack flying like an airplane a different story completely
configuration
no i wouldn't want to use just newtonian to predict the aerodynamic characteristics hypersonically of that vehicle
on the other hand i wouldn't want to fly it there either
it would burn up
blunt body is good ninety eight percents of the energy goes into the shockwave ninety eight percents of the energy goes into your vehicle when you're flying low
a manned entry vehicle enters the earth's atmosphere
you're going to be flying something like a segment of a sphere or at worst a right elliptical cone
and newtonian works good on that one too by the way
we wind tunnel tested those for different configurations
that gets your l d on up to a one point seventy five rather than one point five
yes sir
why couldn't any sort of straight winged configuration make the cross range requirement
the cross range requirement is primarily angle of attack oriented
the relationship between the cg payload in and payload out is a pretty good change
and if you had a straight wing your straight wing cannot be placed in such a way that it trims subsonically and trims hypersonically
now it can at higher angles of attack with less l d you can make it work
but down at forty five degrees you end up with a delta wing configuration
does that answer your question
and that's a good exercise though
but you can go through it on a couple of sheets of paper and say ah ha
because hypersonically you've got that cg you've got your cp you know where it has got to be placed you get down to low angles of attack you know where your cp is for that body you know your cp is up at the quarter card and you know you've got four point five cgs
it doesn't quite work
it takes a delta to do that
so it was more cg related than heating
yes sir
although the one that we mentioned the two hundred nautical mile cross range with a straight wing langley did some tests on that even at high angle of attack
and right in where that straight wing ties back into the fuselage had super high heating rates
but we could put little fillets in there and overcome that heating particular thing
but if you're going to go real fast delta wings look better
all right
yes ma'am
when you were doing all this aerodynamic analysis did you consider a perfect surface or did you also do tests or analysis on what if the tps fails
good question
first of all we have an external insulator
and bob ried will talk to you about that and tom moser probably has too
which meant that our main aluminum surface which we want to keep quite cool is different than the one that we initially designed
we went back in made models that simulated those differences made calculations that simulated those differences
they were very small corrections that needed to be made
then the other question that you had was suppose you lose a piece of tps
which we did
we've lost some chunks of tps early in the program
and you cannot do much testing on that because it's so little bitty and it's like a greased pencil kind of a thing
but you go back in
the first approach is we take some maximum things
the pressure cannot be greater than total and it cannot be less than zero
and so let's put those deltas into that area and into a nice area around there and see if it makes any difference to the aerodynamic coefficients
and they're quite small and so we feel quite comfortable with that
now from a heating a different answer
but from an aerodynamic standpoint does it affect the aerodynamics
we scope it in that way
it's a pretty small area
yes sir
where was the greatest risk on the aerodynamic design
during the first flight was there anything you were particularly concerned about
oh yeah
getting it right
i guess my biggest pucker factor is in the transitional phase
i'd just seen so many things go wrong transonically that transonic wind tunnels miss
it's a dynamic situation where you're moving
and that was personally my greatest concern did we get that right
we did everything we could
and it turned out that we did a good job but i worried about that more than anything else
launch vehicle
primarily did we get the structural loads right and did we put enough margin in
we did not use uncertainties in the pressure distributions
couldn't really figure out how to do that
we had to have balance loads
and if you said my cp can be higher or lower do you put it higher over the whole vehicle or higher here and lower there
and then you've got unbalanced loads
but we did measure the wing bending moments wing shears wing torsion and also the attached loads in those
and so we put some uncertainties on those
and tom has already been here
i don't know if he mentioned how they tried to handle those
but at least they had some of those things
but we never figured out how to put uncertainties and pressure distributions and still be able to get all the balance loads for nastran
maybe one of you all are sharp enough to figure out how to do something like that
but that was the one on the ascent had we adequately covered the uncertainties in pressure distributions with the way that we accomplished that by the uncertainties in the bending moments torsion and shear
let's take a couple minute break and then we can resume with questions
i am going to go down to my office and get one or two things which i think will be interesting that we can also talk about
take a minute or two
instead of one configuration you've got one configuration times five degrees ten degrees minus five degrees
these split down the middle
the same way here body flap
you've got one two three four five times five
you've got twenty five different configurations versus one
and so it means more testing but you're using the same facility
it just means more hours of wind tunnel time more hours of plotting and looking
say a few words about how you did the systems engineering or the systems integration between the aerodynamics and the flight control system
all right
let's take flight control system
we in our division were responsible for aerodynamics and flight dynamics
and flight dynamics wasn't very well defined
the avionics division was responsible for the gn and c system control system and also flight dynamics
so you've got to work together
and you're going to get in one another's bailiwick
that's part of good systems engineering
you're going to do what the other fellow is going to redo and he's going to do what you're going to redo
but our responsibility was two fold
one is we had to have the right aerodynamic characteristics
but before we had the right aerodynamic characteristics we had to have a configuration that should be able to live with a gn and c system
the way we accomplished that is ken cox is ken going to be here with you
no ok
ken cox was head of the avionics and gn and c system
he gave us a functional gn and c system
it didn't have all the strings in it didn't have all of the relays and all the stuff there
but if we gave it a command to change that we knew how much it would change and how long it would take it to change
an elevator position as a for instance
and so that was called a functional gn and c system
it did the right functions but it didn't do it the same method that the real gn and c system did
we would take our aerodynamics and see that it would work
and we would be able to make the maneuvers that were required
and we would analyze it
ad we would be pretty satisfied that with those aerodynamics and with the variations that we were ok
but that didn't say the system was ok
that just said that we had a pretty high probability of making it work
then we sent that aerodynamic database
and all this is happening not ship it throw it over the fence but over a period of time we sent them the aerodynamic characteristics with the variations
and then they beat it bloody flying everything they can think of with their gn and c system
fortunately that worked out pretty well
he would pick up a few things but not anything major
and by the way this is the only vehicle i know that happened that way on the orbiter
we didn't have any major configuration changes that we had to make once we got well into the program
it stayed the same
that's right yes
and that was true
that whole thing not only the gn and c system but the hydraulics is when you give it the command when you say i want a delta theta so much or delta e of so much that it takes it about a quarter of a second to get there
and that's a long time on a lag time when you pile all those things end to end up
now structure is much the same way
they gave us load indicators where they said we can take so much wing shear so much wing torsion so much wing bending so much punch loads into the tank from the attach point in the front so much punch loads into the tank on the backend srb and we have all the gimbling
that's where we're doing the flight performance calculations through the wind shears and the wind gust
and we assure ourselves that we don't violate any of the load indicators
but that does not say the vehicle is safe
then gn and c flies that one through that and gives all those conditions back over to the structures people and they analyze the hound out of it
they look at all the cracks and crevices
and if you have people that don't have a cooperative spirit it will not work
it just doesn't work
so you've got to learn how to get along with your buddies over on the other side
don't build your fiefdom up that your wall is so big and you control your own destiny because you don't
and we had a super group of people to work with
and to me that's what really made it work
the same thing on heating by the way
they would give us heating indicators and we would fly it because that was a little more straightforward where they would give us the q dot locals to q dot references
and we would look through all the q dot references
and we'd give them all the final set of trajectories and they would analyze it in detail
but i look at it as here is a problem and i can work it like a piece of pie and go on this problem go all the way down to the center then go over and eat this piece and this piece
it doesn't work that way
you start around the edges and you cycle in on it
you eat all the pie but you accomplished it around the edges first and work out your bigger problems and then get down to the smaller problems
bass i think the important point too is that no matter what system you work on whether you work on the apollo or you work on the shuttle or whether you work on the new cev you're going to basically have to go through the same process
it may be simpler or harder but you're going to have to go through the same process
absolutely
yes sir
you said there was no major configuration changes like around the program but is there anything that you felt you were kind of stuck with like i wish we could have changed this
like not having the oms pods stick out in the back like that
what that a problem for aerodynamics
no
we lost the increased drag a little bit but not enough to hurt anything
and aerodynamics it didn't bother me any that my l d went down by zero point one
but now the fellows that were flying it they got in there they said i can still go around the hack and i can still do all the things i want to
but all that was done
and once more systems integration you've got to include the crew
gn and c system it doesn't bother them in aero it doesn't bother them in structures but you've still got to fly
and doctor gilvarry said you don't want the pilots talking bad about your airplanes in the bars so keep your crew happy
but to answer your question no not really
to meet the requirements it's going to look pretty much the same
if i designed it today ok let's go back the same requirements now
if you give me a different set of requirements it's not going to look the same
bass some people wanted to put some canards canards that's not a joke
that was done but it was a big argument
a canard is an aerodynamic surface part of the center of gravity
and the beneficial part let me tell you the good parts about canards canards subsonically i can give a pitch up moment and increase my lift
if it's on the aft of the vehicle when i give a pitch up moment i decrease my lift
so canards are wonderful
but what canards do is it fouls up the flow over all of the rest of your vehicle
and so back to here i've got one configuration
unsteady aerodynamics
heating
fixed configuration
i put a canard out there
now i've got two more configurations three more configurations four more five more six more
and it does a lot of grief with vortexes and stuff like that
now if you had to have it you have to have it
concorde had to have it but that didn't mean that shuttle had to have it
it operated fine without canards
i sure wouldn't put canards on there if we had another shot at it
yes ma'am
would it be easier faster or cheaper to design the shuttle the orbiter
you ask good questions young lady
yes and no
with the tools we have and the foreknowledge that we have having been there before absolutely yes
and i don't want to be negative but you don't have the cooperative spirit going on that you had then
i don't know why either
the young engineers are sharper no ifs and or buts
you all know a whole lot more than i ever knew but you don't get along as well
this is mine
i don't need you here
i don't want you here
get out of here
i'm going to do it my way
and that's just an observation i made
it might be that my knothole is too restricted
but it goes up to pretty high management too
not just at the working level
a second thing is they asked me to come in and consult with them
and they had lost technical capability
didn't use any engineers much after a certain time on the shuttle
and then after the last accident they had to bring the engineers in
and they said i've never looked at that and i'm on the payroll
the capability was greatly lacking and so we developed some ways to bring them to speed in about a year and a half period of time which happened
observation
by the way i was pleased that you all got to class on time
i told management to send them to ethics school
now if there is a meeting and you tell somebody you will be there at that time you be there at that time
if you tell somebody you will make a deliverable at that time you make a deliverable at that time
be a man or woman of your word
and i found that lacking
i don't know that ethics school helped too much that we sent them all to
well it did too because the second day of class there were i think ten of them late
and he sent them back and wouldn't let them in the class
but learn to get along with folks
they are your friends
they're your buddies
they are going to be there for a lifetime
and yeah you're going to have some grief
and yeah he will give you some headaches or she will give you some headaches
but you're all on the same team and work hard towards that
i know you've got to grit your teeth and spit sometimes but that's major
and that didn't cost you anything
about the wind tunnel testing firstly could you have reduced that now with cfd
and secondly you showed there were several hundred tests
yes
and several tens of thousands of hours
yes
does that mean each test ran for several hundred hours
some tests ran for hundreds of hours
that was the total number of hours for all those tests not a per hour basis
but yeah there were some hundred hour tests that went on
to answer your question does cfd reduce the number of wind tunnel hours
three areas that we're working in right now
one reason is to bring the engineers up to technical speed where they can stand up and be counted
and you can ask them a technical question they can give you a technical answer and say this is my analysis and this is how i got that
to do that we recommended back to johnson spacecraft center that you better get your engineers knowing how to do wind tunnel tests and you've got to get them to know how to make the calculations to run these programs
you've got to be able to do all that
that's your integration contractor
they need to have that capability
and they've done that and they really came up to speed
in the midst of that they've also increased their cfd capabilities
and i'm very envious of what you can do with cfd
however it hasn't decreased the amount of runs that they're requesting
it's increasing the amount of runs that they're requesting because they will do this little bitty analysis and here is the cable tray going down that and they'll say does it go sonic under the cable tray
well i don't know
what does the wind tunnel test say
well we just have a data point here and a data point here and our cfd shows that it can go sonic under there we need to test that to make sure that's there
and so it could but i don't think it will
i think the better your tools get you want to make sure they're right
now one day i think yes that's going to happen but right now there is still a lot of question even in the cfd er's mind am i really right
and they've always been accused of they can tell you what the right answer is if you give it to them
and that's really not true any longer
that was for a number of years
but that cfd is so great
and they used overflow by the way is the one that's primary to the big workhorse right now and it does a super job
was there a question
all right
any other question
i would like to address the question that was asked about
let me not talk necessarily about the shuttle but let me talk about apollo for a moment
and i mentioned it before
in apollo we went to the moon with a single string avionic system
we had one imu one computer on the command and service module
we had one service propulsion system to get you out of lunar orbit or to get you into lunar orbit
and i think today it would be very difficult to do that
i think you're probably going to have to have multiple strings
you're going to have an escape system
i think in that context it may be more difficult
i do think the tools you have today will make it easier but i do think what we know today just like bass said on understanding a little bit about the aerodynamics you want more
i think in some respects my comment is that the next time we go to the moon we're going to find out how hard it really was because i do think it's going to be hard to do
at least that's my personal feeling
and i think a lot of people agree with me
one of the toughest decisions we ever made in the space program and bass and i were talking about it at breakfast is when we decided to do apollo eight
apollo eight was probably the most fantastic mission that we ever came up with
that was the first time we left the influence of earth's gravity we went into orbit around the moon and we got out of orbit of the moon
now we didn't land on the moon but did everything we had to do for the first time
and i think that was probably the boldest decision that nasa and the government ever made
again i look back and i'm not sure how we would make that decision today
it was pretty tough
and of course one man led that attack george low who was manager of the apollo program office at johnson space center then became deputy administrator and then became president of rensselaer polytechnic institute
but that was really a fantastic project
i will comment on the programs that i worked on
aerodynamics on dyna soar which was a defunked air force manned spacecraft program
i worked on mercury gemini apollo and blue gemini
and each time i would go onto the next program and learn more i would say we sure were lucky
when i was telling you about these new young engineers now that are up to speed where they didn't want to say anything
now that they're crunching numbers they got a lot of criticism for the way we did it
and rightfully so
a lot of capability that is there
and you're going to have more capability today than you had yesterday more capability on the next program than you had on the last program
you're going to find some things to do and be able to do it better than the last program was done
that's both good news and bad news
bad news is it will cost you more to do it and the good news is it will be done a whole lot better
all right
any other question
i thought it might be interesting just to make sure you really have an understanding of what the shuttle has to do to sort of take them through the entry
and maybe bass you'll make some comments about the aerodynamics and i'll talk a little bit about the operations
you're in orbit a couple hundred miles above the ground and the first thing that you do is basically put the orbiter after you get everything stowed and ready for entry so you're essentially going backwards face to the ground
and you burn the oms engines
and just in terms of redundancy we've got two engines
you can cross feed the fuel that is inside the oms pod
you can cross feed from one side to the other
so even if you lose one oms engine you can still do a de orbit burn just on the other engine
of course you will have to turn a little bit so that you can burn through the cg
if you lose both oms engines you can cross feed the propellant into the reaction control system aft jets and you can come back using those
and if you're having a real bad day and you run out well you know you might have a fuel leak for instance and so you don't have enough propellant back there
actually there was a procedure where you then would flip over and burn the remainder of your forward rcs propellant to just slow yourself down as much as you could
we never had to do that
in fact i don't think we ever lost an oms engine
but we practice all these things
anyway the point is one way or the other you slow yourself down
here is the earth and here is your orbit
this is grossly out of scale
you realize that on this scale your orbit is actually about like that
in any case you do your burn just enough to lower your perigee just about two ground level
and now you're essentially in free fall
i mean you're in free fall in orbit but now you're gradually getting closer to the earth
and so what you do is you now flip over and you put yourself in a position where when you actually hit the top upper reaches of the atmosphere and about four hundred thousand feet is what we call entry interface
and actually the flight control system changes at that point and the computer actually goes into a different mode
so at this point you're now at a forty degree angle
and as bass said that gives you your blunt surfaces approaching
and basically the sensors feel the deceleration
and that's really how you know where you are in the entry
you sense the deceleration
that tells you what the dynamic pressure is
during the early part of the entry all of your control is by the reaction control system because you don't have enough dynamic pressure on the aerodynamic surfaces to be effective
as you get down further and further into the atmosphere let's see
i think the number that comes to mind is ten
i assume that's ten pounds per square foot dynamic pressure
yes
is when the ailerons become effective
and so you have what is called a blended control system
the first thing that you can do is actually control your roll and so you disable the roll jets and you enable the ailerons
but the pitch and the yaw is still controlled by the rcs
and the critical thing like bass was saying is you've got to keep your angle of attack constant with respect to your velocity vector because your aerodynamic heating depends on that
if you get down to too low an angle now you're going to heat the surfaces the upper part of the orbiter and you're going to burn up
you're controlling your angle around the velocity vector
and now you can move about that
you have a lift vector
and now the whole name of the game because remember this is a glider
and so energy control is what is absolutely essential to make sure that you're going to end up at the threshold of the runway at about you said we were aiming for one hundred fifty knots
we never actually made it
actually about two hundred knots was the touchdown speed
but pretty good anyway
we got close
at every phase of your entry knowing your energy and controlling it is critical
for instance for whatever reason if your burn didn't go right and you think you're going to be short of the runway we notched down the angle of attack just a little bit
i think about thirty eight degrees was about the lowest you could safely go
and you keep your lift vector
you basically would fly the entire entry with your lift vector going away from the earth and that maximizes your range
but you actually target the entry so that you have more energy than you need because it's a lot easier to bleed off energy than somehow to get it back especially when you don't have any engines
what you normally do then is you will basically do a roll maneuver
and you'll be rolling so that your angle of attack with respect to your velocity vector is always forty degrees
but essentially you're rolling around the velocity vector so you can now point your lift over to the side
and for instance if you didn't have enough propellant when you were burning and so now you actually have too much energy what you're going to do or for instance if you have a lot of cross range that you have to make up you could spend your entire entry over on your side like this
and in fact there was even a case which we would simulate if you have an under burn now you have too much energy and you have to get really get rid of a lot of energy you could actually roll one hundred eighty degrees
and that would be pretty sporty
again nobody has ever had to do that
but we did simulate it
and i don't know what you would make of the aerodynamics coming in but the point is you have a basic design that you're working with and then you try to develop operational procedures to make the system work in as many contingencies as possible
anyway that's the deal
you basically are rolling around the velocity vector to control both your energy and your cross range
let's see
then at twenty psf the elevons actually get pitch affectivity and so you disable the pitch jets
and now both the pitch and the roll are controlled by the elevons
the vertical stabilizer as you can see is in the shadow
and so actually you don't get yaw affectivity out of the vertical stabilizer until just about transonic and subsonic when you actually do the final pitch over to get ready for going into the heading alignment circle
and that's why sometimes if you've seen pictures of the shuttle as it approaches the landing at kennedy space center you will see little plumes come out the side
and that's the yaw jets and the rcs which are still firing because it's still supersonic when it gets over the space center
and if you're on the ground you can actually hear this double sonic boom which is pretty impressive
and i guess you get one from the front and one from the back of the vehicle so it's a boom boom and then it goes around
and then of course you hit the atmosphere at mach twenty five
and so you're going through this entire aerodynamic regime down through hypersonic supersonic transonic subsonic
and i remember max faget gave us a little talk about how the aerodynamic coefficients
i mean you were talking about them but they change at different mach numbers right
oh yes
and we mentioned this before you know why you really need a fly by wire system on this vehicle because the control laws that you're using to do a roll maneuver at mach fifteen are different from doing a roll maneuver at mach eight
these program test inputs you can hardly see them
i mean you really didn't feel them
they were just a couple of degrees that you would move the stick you know just little things
but that collected enough data to get a much better determination of these coefficients
you're very sensitive to things like beta angle
probably about two degrees
if you go off more than that
actually when you read the detailed description of the loss of columbia when they had a penetration of the forward edge of the wing that disturbed the airflow
and so the control system was fighting a really valiant fight to keep columbia on target
and they could see that on the ground
there was more aerodynamic surface activity and the rcs jets kicked in
in the end of course you run out of control authority and the vehicle eventually diverged and it actually broke up aerodynamically
it was not an explosion
it just broke up aerodynamically
the hot gases in the wing were disrupting the airflow and eventually the wing was slumping and so things were just getting worse and worse
and i don't know exactly what went first
pieces were falling off along the way
the same thing if you read the analysis of the challenger accident on a second by second basis you'll see the main engines were adjusting their thrust and trying to keep it the system was really working hard just doing what it was supposed to do
essentially the flight control system was trying to keep it within the control boundaries and eventually it ran out of muscle because of the other failures
and once you go to a bad beta angle or angle of attack the vehicle breaks up aerodynamically
bass you might say a word about the aerodynamic coefficients and which ones were the hardest to determine and how big
ok
basically aerodynamic coefficients are normal forces side forces rolling moments yawing moments pitching moments and those that change that like elevators body flaps rudders and speed breaks
the coefficients the biggest variations are in the low supersonic to transonic speed regimes primarily in the control variables
the biggest ones were just before transition or any time that the elevators were in an up position where the flow couldn't quite decide whether to be attached or separated
and so you want to avoid that
digging down not very much variations in those at all but coming in the up position pretty big variations in the rolling moments and yaw moments due to those
and we tried to avoid those of course and henceforth with the cg location
but those were the ones that probably were the toughest and we tried to stay away from
overall hypersonics right on subsonics second best transonic the most difficult low supersonic kind of in between there
the coefficients it's hard to talk about them on a percentage basis because cm is zero and the delta cm is an infinite percentage so you cannot really talk about them on a percentage basis
but when you look at the plots like cm versus alpha very small variation after we got through with the flight test program
before we got through the flight test program we probably cut the variations in half on things like pitching moments yawing moments and rolling moments
we did better than that on the pitching moments yawing moments and rolling moments due to elevator positions when they were local angles of attack
and those were cut quite significantly with the ptis
but still even today you don't just have one coefficient at one angle of attack one angle of side slippage
you evaluate that one plus the variation that's about it
and i remember one of the big activities in the simulators before the first flight
they would have the test flight crews who were going to make these flights do flying entries
and they would actually vary the aerodynamic coefficients
and if you put in a big enough variation three sigma and all of the parameters and they went in the wrong direction you could always make it impossible to have a successful entry
and so it was a real question where the managers and aaron maybe you have something to say about that you and chris kraft had to really make the decision when you knew enough and when you could fly safely
you're going to hear chris kraft talk shortly
but i remember after we landed the first mission there were a lot of people saying that the shuttle wasn't going to work all the tiles were going to come off
the flight control system was a big issue because of the aerodynamics
the flight control system the aerodynamics wasn't going to work
i don't know if you've ever been to the johnson space center and to the control room but i was sitting at the consul with chris kraft and he got on the net and said because there was a lot of criticism
a lot of people wrote letters that the shuttle would crash and wasn't going to make it
and he got on the net and said we're infinitely smarter today
and i guess that summarized it we were infinitely smarter and we did design a good system
and i think that about summed it up that we were infinitely smarter
any more questions
yeah
actually it's an operational question
ok
i'm just wondering if the entire crew is trained on the whole landing procedure
no
we have two pilots just like in any airplane
some of the people who flew center seat as flight engineers were trained pilots
and i would have been quite comfortable if they had landed the shuttle
but how many failures do you prepare for
we have two people onboard who are trained to land
i always thought to myself we also have this auto land software which nobody has ever used
but if somehow all the other six people were incapacitated and it was just me i would push the auto land sequence
and all you have to do is put the gear down manually and i know how to do that
but landing the shuttle is really very complicated
and they train hundreds and hundreds of hours in the simulator
some day we could spend a whole session talking about the shuttle training aircraft
it is one thing to land in the simulator but nobody has ever died in a simulator number one
and number two you're looking at a tv screen
you're not actually looking out at the runway
you don't feel the bumpy aerodynamics
and so they developed a shuttle training aircraft which is the gulfstream ii very heavily modified
it's actually a flying simulator
your final approach because your l d on this vehicle i don't know what it is exactly is about five maybe
i think five at best yeah
you're coming in at about a twenty degree approach angle which may not seem like a lot
but a commercial airplane comes in at about three degrees and the problem is you take a regular airplane and you point it down at a twenty degree angle and your airspeed is going to go above your redline
so you've got to make enough drag to simulate the shuttle
there's computers inside this shuttle training aircraft
the left seat is set up to be just like the shuttle cockpit and when the pilot makes the maneuvers it basically goes back into the computers and they work the flight control system of the gulf stream to make the gulf stream fly like the shuttle
the only way that they can produce enough drag to make it go at a constant speed at a twenty degree angle is you have full speed brakes your gear is down you have thrust reverses you run your engines in reverse after your on the runway to slow youself down
on the gulf stream they run their engines at ninety percents reverse thrust while they're flying in the air
it's an extraodinary vehicle
i've flown in the center seat just to sit in it and you may be flying on this angle but it looks like your flying like this it's really extraodinary
just one thing to remind you a week from today we've asked for the initial report outline plus some reference material
what we want to get a sense of what is your plans what's the scope of what you're going to be looking at what are you going to deal with and i hope by this time that you've located some reference materials you're going to be using
we'll be sort of spiralling in on this so the idea is we'll take a look at what your plans are and then we can work together if you have some questions or having difficulties this gives us some opportunities to talk about it to make sure you're on the right track so you'll be doing something that you can be proud of that you'll actually learn something from so that's due a week from today
it would be useful for me to have those electronically so that i can send them to professor cohen for him to look at
i am happy to accept hard copy as well but i want them electronically any questions
have a good weekend
allen louviere started life as an airplane designer went to lamar university in texas and then worked at general dynamics in fort worth
you told me about the yb fifty seven
i don't know what other planes you worked on up there but oh b fifty eight s b thirty six s f sixteen s
f one hundred eleven s and b fifty seven fs
then they wanted to send him all around the world and had a young family
and that was about the time that johnson space center which at that time was called the manned space flight center was getting started in houston in one thousand nine hundred sixty two
so allen came to work
and his specialty is mechanical systems
we had a little discussion last night about some of the things that he has designed but for me one of the most amazing is the landing gear on the lunar module
i mean when you think that you can actually design the first piece of the hardware that touches down on another planet that's pretty exciting
and like most of the people who have been lecturing he went onto work in similar systems for the shuttle
so he also worked on the landing gear
you can see a piece of tire here
we'll talk about that landing gear payload bay doors and robotic arms
and so he's going to share with us some of the experiences both from the subsystem design point of view and then from the bigger systems engineering picture
so allen it is all yours
thank you
the lunar landing was sort of interesting
the big problem was we didn't know what the lunar surface was like so you didn't know how to size the pad which is always interesting
the landing gear we are going to talk about today was much easier and it will do
we're just going to talk about just mechanical systems
it's not as romantic or ingratiating but you've got to have them
so some of the avionics and other systems that you will see
actually i should say one thing
from the point of view of space engineering in general
when you're building satellites or other space systems the one thing that you try to avoid at all costs i think this is far to say is any mechanisms
because you send a mechanism into space and they fail
they get too cold they get too hot they get vacuum welded
now sometimes when you have people on a mission they can fix it
i mean if you remember apollo sixteen the lunar rover one of the fenders broke off
and so they actually had to make another fender out of their checklist so that the dust didn't get all over them
but basically that is the fear that all mechanical designers live in is that you're designing these things to work in an incredible environment
and i'm sure you will talk about the landing gear
that is one thing
we know how to build landing gear for airplanes but how do you keep them alive for two weeks in space in a rather unfriendly environment
well the professor is right
the problem you have is when you get these mechanical systems if you have a lot of linkages you're afraid they're going to weld themselves together
and we've never had that happen but it certainly could
the division i was in had all of these pieces
the landing gear
we had all the doors on orbiter
i think there were twenty five or thirty five doors on orbiter that had to have mechanisms that had to open and close
we built the repair tools
we had a set of tools for these fellows to us
and if that payload door didn't close that was really a bad day
we put some tools onboard a little wrench and a lot of cutting tools and you will see some of that
the manipulator these are pretty well things that had been done before
we had never done one of these before
that's a whole different animal
the separation system was for the separation system for the external tank
there were three big separation systems
it was not only a mechanical system but it was a pyro system it was an explosive type system
believe or not we had the ejection seats on about the first four or five flights
we used the sr seventy one blackbird seats
and we never had to use them thank goodness
we also had the docking system
we had the apollo system
we had the apollo soyuz
and if you look at the orbiter it is very close to apollo soyuz with a little bit of modification to it
that's the whole system
but fear not we're not going to talk about all of those because that's just too many to talk about
we're going to talk about two
we're going to talk about the landing gear wheels brakes and tires
and we've been building these for a long time
it's more empirical design than i ever realized when we got into it
we had never built a manipulator before
and we started this as a technology study and it ended up being the main cargo handling piece on the orbiter
also we did a lot of coordination and integration
all mechanical systems depend a lot on other people
he tells me that he wants to emphasize systems engineering and i would like to second that because it's very important that you know that
when you look at the systems engineering by the way you don't have to be silent
if you want to speak now is the time
i'm just here for a day
i'm going to talk about this
all engineers love the design part
i did
i found out that there was a little more to it than i first suspected
if you look at requirements schedules cost and weight most of the engineering work you think would be here in the requirements
once they are set sometimes they're very difficult to change
on orbiter they were very difficult to change
and we may have gotten some requirements that maybe we could have done a little better with had we changed them early
and you will see the results of that particularly on the landing gear
that is probably the number one thing that we worry about at johnson
we like to keep these guys where they come back
now these pieces right here are really engineering sort of things
they relate to physics and maybe even newtonian mechanics
these don't
those are really estimates that somebody makes early
and what they end being is a refinement process
most of these equations these fellows use from here are really empirically developed over many years
they say here is the way this goes
but all of these end up being estimates
you think you're going to work there but these three right here schedule cost and particularly for us in the aerospace weight turns out to be a big big driver
in fact it will tell you what you're going to have to do in many cases
well we're going to talk a lot about that
we'll talk a little bit about test
i presume you all in your labs do a little testing of some sort
but we do a lot
we do development testing early on
for the manipulator we did a little bit more than that
we do qualification testing which is i'm going to go test this thing and see if it meets all the specifications that somebody has designed for it or the requirements
and last but not least after all of that is done you do what is called a verification and certification test
and it should be ready for flight
i don't know what industries you're going to work on but even in avionics if all of your avionics people there's a mechanical guy
even in avionics you'll have some sort of validation and certification test
and these will drive you too
after all this is done we did a flight test program
and the initial test that came back from there made us do some changes on this
and then you always get this
engineers are never satisfied with just making it good
better is what they want
and program managers where is aaron
he is not here today so i don't have to worry about him
program managers don't like that because what happens is this goes up and this goes up and that slows down and that's not what they want to do so we have to go back and do that
enough of the intro
these were essentially the first requirements that i could conjure up after all these years
you've got to remember this was thirty years ago
some of these may be a little off but they are about right
it was going to be a freefall gear
we're just going to get it started open the doors and let the aerodynamics and just the weight of it drop that gear down and lock it in place
the gear extension time was nominally ten seconds
that was the max that we ever wanted it
it would probably go down at about six or seven
and we normally said the landing velocity we don't want to drop that gear
once the gear is down we don't want to go more than two hundred twenty five knots
remember this is in the early seventy s and we're still trying to figure out what we're going to do
but you've got to have some requirements to start with and these were the ones you started with
we had a runway
and we said the runway is going to be twelve thousand five hundred feet
we would like fifteen thousand feet but because of the flight that the orbiter took there were landing sites all over the world so we had to be sure that we'd get the landing sites with the twelve thousand five hundred feet at least
cross winds
when you're coming in for a landing if you have a cross wind fifteen knots was about it
we'll chat a little bit about that
the deceleration that was just for the brakes
we had three hydraulic sources that we could use
there were some auxiliary power units in the back that powered up the hydraulic system and we had about three sources
most air craft just have two and a pneumonic system
we did not have a pneumatic system
but that worked very well by the way
the steering is nose gear steering
and the hand controllers you could steer the front nose gear
and it would go plus or minus nine degrees
the turnover angle if you just took two wheels and turned it over the max that you could ever get out of that was about sixty three degrees
this set of requirements is about what we started with
and not to stop you here are some more
these turn out to be really pretty critical
we will call them critical conditions that the orbiter has to meet
and this is landing weights
and that is just how fast you're coming in when you hit the runway
at two hundred fourteen thousand pounds we were going to say we can take a sink rate of nine point six feet per second which is pretty fast
and this is nominal
if you go to orbit and you come back and you make a nominal landing
if it's two hundred thirty thousand pounds it's about six feet per second
i came in yesterday on an eight hundred eighty
i asked the pilot what he landed at and it was one hundred thirty knots
and i think the weight of that thing is about one hundred fifty thousand to one hundred seventy thousand pounds
we're coming in with no engines so we're coming in pretty fast to be able to do that and set down
this is an abort condition
if we're on a mission and the controller is calling abort you take off turn around and come back and come back to the cape
in that case we have a payload onboard so the weight is going to be a little heavier
now the pilot has to be a little better here because he's got to have a little lower sink rate because we don't want to take all that load in the gear
in fact the transatlantic landing when was working there were only two sites
one was at dakar across the atlantic and the other was at rota spain
i think newfoundland now is one for the high inclination ones
and aoa was once around
you'd go up to orbit and you'd come right back down the next time around so you'd get back to the cape
that was essentially what we had
this particular one was a driver also because in the early days the air force wanted to have a mission like this where you'd go up once you deploy a satellite and you come back around
and they were only one single orbit and you'd come back around
now getting those payload bay doors open and getting the satellite out was to say the least an interesting design problem to do that
you don't have a lot of time
anyway these were the other drivers that you had to do
these were the ones that really drive you because they'll tell you what the loads are in the system
and this just tells you that all nasa guys have these acronyms
this is a set of circumstances that says we want fail operational fail operation fail safe
so if it fails first you can still operate it if it fails again at least you're fail safe and you at least preserve the crew
we usually use fail op fail op fail safe
in this case in the landing gear we only had two
but we had a whole lot of ways to get this gear down
and i'll show you
it's kind of complicated to take a look at but if you release the gear it starts to fall just by gravity but then we have a little hydraulic assist and then we have a pyro backup
whether you want that pyro to fire or not it's going to fire every time you drop the gear
so when the gear comes out it comes out backwards
and the airflow is this way which drops the gear down and locks it into place
that gear is not a light gear
i mean it's pretty heavy
you're talking about four hundred or five hundred pounds coming down
and that's just the nose
the main gears are larger
and then the mains operate about the same way
and i'll show you where all this stuff is
i have a little drawing here that will get you going
the professor and i talked a little bit about design
yes
you only drop the landing gear a few seconds before landing
if one fails you still have time to do all the others
i'm sorry
you only drop the landing gear a few seconds before touchdown
yeah
if one method fails did you still have enough time to try one of the others
we decided that all three of these were going to be in play every time
we made sure that we got that gear down
that's truly a bad day if that gear is not down
all you do from the cockpit is just put down the gear handle and then everything works at once
everything works at once
you don't have to decide has the gear gone down and if not do something else
it just all works
i think you'll find that we tend at johnson space center to overdesign on the side of safety
and it really didn't matter to us anyway
we really want that gear to go down and lock in place and that's what this is all about
the other things that we worried about and probably where the requirements on this particular vehicle were the weakest we said we could turn this thing around in thirty to sixty days at the cape after every flight
well that really didn't work out that way
when you have that many systems onboard and there is so much to take a look at after you've gone to a flight just the post flight operations is a long time
and i'm not sure we ever made thirty days ever
we may have made sixty once i think but i'm not sure
and the other thing was the pad stay time
first flight as i recall was on the pad for about four to six months
and now you've got to make all your systems work
it's like having shelf life on this thing
you've got to make this thing work
it's got to function
that was the other one and that was a big problem for us particularly from tires
they leak
you sure don't want to have those tires leaking in about four to six months
we had no landing propulsion system
once those guys came in it was all energy management from an altitude all the way
and the landing velocities were rather high the weights were rather high
probably some of you fly
let's see
a seven hundred thirty seven weighs about i'd say one hundred sixty thousand to one hundred seventy thousand pounds
and they come in just right at about a maximum of one hundred seventy five miles an hour but we're coming in with no engines at about two hundred
the runway touchdown point i've got a little drawing of a runway and i'll show you what that is that turned out to be a real key issue
when we started out that twelve thousand five hundred feet i showed you was actually ten point zero
and after a while we decided without engines and then without reverse thrusters we really couldn't do that
while that not only affected the cape design but it affected where in the world we could land this thing i think guam was the other place
we could go to anderson air force base on guam right
yeah
and here is what frightens all mechanical engineers limited testing where we're only going to have about three or four flights
we were going to have five
it worked so well that they decided to go with four
and everybody gritted their teeth on that one because we really wanted one more flight
these are some more requirements of sorts but these were outside requirements that you have to take what you get
and so when you do design work or whatever field you're going to work in you're going to find you're not always your own boss on this
you have to go with what you've got
and i think that's part of the system of engineering
we were told that the idea of moving the orbiter with the seven hundred forty seven wasn't brought up immediately and that it was going to tried to be move with like strap on engines
so this part about no end flight retraction
the first design of the orbiter actually the early designs had jet engines but the weight remember we talked about the weight earlier
the weight just drove that out
we couldn't do that
plus when you reentered with those engines you've got another problem with all the heating
and you probably have the fuel that you have to worry about so you've got a lot of problems
would that have been a real big problem
yeah it would cost you money and weight
remember those two things i told you up there
it would cost you money and weight
remember now congress is a finicky bunch
you don't go back to them unless you really have to to get the money
if aaron is here he could probably give you a lecture on that
he used to lecture me on that as a matter of fact
the carrier aircraft or ferry one of the guys in our division a gentleman who just passed away recently named john kyker had been a b twenty four pilot
actually he and another fellow named owen morris built a little model of the seven hundred forty seven and a model of the orbiter
and they actually flew it
the wingspan was about like that
and they actually flew it to see if it would be all right to put that orbiter on top of that model
and by golly surprise it worked like a charm
also when they flew that model they found that they had on entry a different setting on their elevon than what was being projected
and low and behold they went back and they found yes they did and they changed it
we don't have any in flight retraction for what you were talking about
we would get the gear stored on the pad and ready to go
and as i said we want to be sure it comes down when we tell it to come down
actually in the hanger the orbiter is up on jacks
and one of the last things they do before they wheel in a carrier mechanism that will take the orbiter out over to the vehicle assembly building you have to push the gear up manually
and actually the final stage because it has to actually go in and lock inside the locking mechanism someone is up there basically with a big pole and just push it up until you get it to click into place
and that's terrible
there is no hydraulic system to reconnect it
well we get a little bit of hydraulic help but it's not enough
you have to get manual labor
but it's all because of the weight and cost that we were talking about
and weight was really one of the big issues
when you go to work you're going to find out that all of those empirical things not the design problems not the newtonian physics is what really gets you
did they have any sort of like emergency barricades at landing sites if a tire went
yes they did
at dakar we put up a net at the end of it
and i think dakar was one of the shorter runways
i think we were worried that when we came in at dakar with the kind of peddles we were carrying that the orbiter was going to be very heavy
it would be this two hundred fifty six thousand pound thing
and that's a big thing with no engines
and we'll talk about the brakes here a little bit
the brakes were not really qualified for a short stop on a heavy vehicle
remember in the early days we had no drag shoot
no drag shoot
well we're going to talk about that too
i'm going to try to talk about all this stuff until you guys go to sleep or something
well enough of that
one last thing
you will see that i'm worrying you to death on requirements
whether you like it or not when you go into engineering you're going to find that if you get the requirements right you'll probably get the design right
if they are not right you're going to have lots of trouble
we didn't get them all right
we didn't get them all right but it was good engineering work
the tire pressure we had to start somewhere so we said here is what we're going to do
we're going to do some sizing on these tires
and on the landing gear we did this before we even had a contractor our first pressure was about three hundred forty
i think the tires on your car are around thirty five psi or something like that if you're lucky on a good day and they're not leaking
and the upgrade now is about three hundred eighty
i think they want to go to four hundred ten
the wheel is aluminum
the axel is aluminum
we've actually bent the axel before
we've landed that thing
the first axel we had we bent the axel
it deflected a little bit and took the brakes out
that was another one of those things so we had to up that
it was sealed with two o rings
that was a good one
that was good to start with
the initial design as a matter of fact was great because that four months we had to stay on the pad for the first flight we got no leakage which was good
the initial brake pads were beryllium
now beryllium has one great feature that everybody liked
the langley research center had been working on brakes and they were using beryllium
goodrich had been working with the beryllium
and it turns out that it has a great heat transfer capability and we thought that was really going to be good
and what do you say in your jargon
wrong
it was wrong
it did not work out right
we had four rotors to start with
we have five now
if you're going to look at your brakes i've got a picture up here just like the front wheel brakes on your car they have a caliper and you just put a pad on it
but we have more pads than you do
you will see some more about this
this really got us
a negative angle of attack if you ever looked at the orbiter when it was sitting on the runway it sits nose down
and when you come in and you drop that nose down it's going to load up that main gear
and you will see what that does
that might be all of the requirements that i have to start with
here is what the wheel looks like
this particular drawing or graph is really what we started with
and these are the summary things that we began with
and this is the nose gear
there are probably two or three things over here that are really important that we had to worry about
one was a static load and the other was the weight for this thing
this is all aluminum
and we didn't want those going up
at the time inflation pressure for the nose was three hundred
i think it's still a little more than that
but the rest of this is just spec sort of things
now when we did this we had to start with something
we did not have all this data
what we did is we had a chart similar to this in conjunction with rockwell and we worked back and forth
that's another one of the interfaces that you had
you always have a contractor
and of course rockwell had several contractors i think ten or twelve on this gear
getting this particular chart straight was very very important to us
maybe some of the features there is the inflation valve the diameter here is about i think this one was about thirty two inches thirty four
and one of the design problems you get is how big a tire can i put in the wing or how big a tire can i put in the nose
now the orbiter wing is pretty good
it's kind of deep
the nose is not that roomy but the nose gear is a smaller wheel
it doesn't take the load
that is low right now
i think that's a little higher
here is the tire that goes with that
the same sort of thing
we start out with a sheet similar to this not this neat and not this accurate but now you'll notice that the tire weight is about fifty pounds
now we're about one hundred pounds of tire just for one wheel and tire on the nose gear
and there are two so now we're at two hundred pounds
i will tell you for sure program managers will ask you what those weights are
if aaron were here he'd be fussing
he'd say yeah you let that get away from you
but that was the other one
this is not terribly dramatic
but i think the other thing is see this thing the design tire life was just for two landings
i'm not sure we've ever done two landings on a nose gear
i think after every flight we will take them off
and because of the way the runway is built i will show you a little bit about the runway
here is a tire
this is alt one which is approach and landing test one
if you can lift it
i am going to pass it around for you
this is alt one
here you will see that we've got twenty plies which is all this stuff here
and that is what we used
i think it is twenty eight now
and you will see that at the top here is real rubber which is great but synthetic rubber is better
the tire we have now is synthetic rubber and is much better than what we have
and you will see we have these beads in here
now when you go back to the other piece here we've got to realize that if you've ever tried to change a tire and you put the tire all of you have bicycles
everybody in this town has got a bicycle i think
even him
anyway when you try to change a tire you can put one side in
but getting this on would be really tough
see if you try to change this tire out it would be pretty hard
you have to split the wheel so you can get that thing and you put it in and then you put the wheel around the tire instead of putting the tire around the wheel
and when you see this thing you will understand why
i will pass this around for you and you can take a look
it is heavy
and those beads are really interesting
they mean business
they are tough
they are steel
here is a nose gear
this is sts ninety five
where you on ninety five
oh i've got yours in here
i've got yours
well i'm going to let you tell it
this hit pretty hard
and if you take a look you can barely see it right there but a chunk of rubber came off
and it's that good rubber that i was telling you about
it's the natural rubber
the ones we have now are better
and when these tires hit i think this particular one they dropped the nose gear on rotation early
and i think when they did they hit the tough part of the concrete at the cape
and you just get rubber everywhere
smoke and rubber and all kinds of stuff
i think these are thirty two or thirty four
these are things that you really have to go and handle with care
they are big
you'll note there are no brakes on these front tires
we will get that in a little bit
just to comment
last time we talked a little bit about what goes on when you actually land but what allen was saying is you flare out and then the pilot has to stay on the rear gear and hold the nose up for just the right amount of time
if you hold it up for too long then you're going to lose the lift
and in the end the nose gear is going to fall down too fast and you run the risk of busting your nose tire
on the other hand when you come down because of the negative angle you actually as allen said when you get down below horizontal now you're putting more weight on the rear wheels
and so if you come down too early now you run the risk of blowing your rear tires
and so it's really a critical maneuver
you have to hold it up just the right amount of time and then bring it down real slowly
i think lousma was a marine wasn't he
yeah
astronaut lousma came in
we didn't like him to fly too much because i think he did carrier landings or something
i'm not sure what the guy did
he'd come in and drop that gear down pretty hard and we'd all cringe thinking those tires were going to go
now we saw the nose gear
this is a repeat performance except now we've got to make this wheel so we can put the brakes on it
we've got to put the wheels on
and now the same thing
now i'm going to tell you a little bit about integration with other people
in the landing gear world we were at the mercy of the structure's people
you really wanted to be friends with them because they told you what the loads were
and coordination with those people was really critical
and i'm sure you're going to find that
if you're in any kind of construction whatsoever all the structures folks you want to get them early on
and the other people you want in there early are the operations people
those two people are the ones you want very very early
here is the right load now
if you just multiply that by four you'd get about two hundred fifty thousand pounds two hundred seventy thousand pounds that we could take
and that is about what you're going to get on that back gear
when you come down you will get a little less than that
we have about twenty percents to thirty percents margin empirically designed
and we tested it at wright patterson
we tested this wheel
this is a single o ring wheel
the o ring is about right there
and we tested this at wright patterson with a side load on it like on the flight he was on
and i had to tell aaron cohen that every piece of the wheel came apart which is not what you want to do with the program manager but we had to start over
so we did
and we beefed up the wheel we beefed up the bolts
we found that the two o rings we liked because they were good for leakage but we also found that when you put them on that the wheel failed because of the o rings
also they failed because we were putting the wrong lubricant on those bolts and that took a while
and that particular failure i just talked to you about had both those problems
how did the lubricant cause the wheel to come apart
they couldn't get the right torque on the bolts
i think they put too much torque on the bolts
we never really found out but we changed lubricants and that went away
i told you now this is not newtonian physics we're talking about here
we're talking about empirical design
and you had to go test this stuff
and we did
let's see what was the other point
here is where the axel fits in here
i will show you where the brakes go here in just a minute
i don't have a main gear tire cut like that one but it's much larger
it's about forty
i think this one was forty two inches
they tell me that they want to go to forty four inches for a little bigger wheel
in the beginning again weight and cost stopped us from going any farther than that
mainly weight in that case
again this was the critical wheel that we had to work with the structures people
our structures group worked it and rockwell structures group worked it so we had two structures groups that were working together and we had to wait until they gave us a load
but when you have a design you cannot really wait until all the loads are in
you have to start with something so we started with a design that we thought was conservative
it was not
but we started with one that we thought was conservative and it did not do it
you can see that the max load was one hundred forty two thousand pounds per wheel which gave us a nice margin
of course those are the aft wheels the main gear
and we liked that margin on there
and the inflation pressure is about three hundred seventy on that
this thing is like a stick of dynamite
if it blows you have really got some problems
i mean you have shrapnel everywhere
but when you do the test it is always behind the cage or something where you can do it
again safety was our problem
when i saw that last orbiter come in i thought for sure that something had happened to the wheel well and that the explosion was in the wheel well
it terrified me
partially it was not the wheels that went
they went eventually but if you blow four of those wheels two on each side that's not a good day at all
the orbiter is about the same size as a seven hundred thirty seven
everybody flies a boeing seven hundred thirty seven about the same size but they land a little softer and not quite as heavy
but the geometry a planned form looks about the same
they don't have the payload bay that we have but it is pretty close
and here are the big guys
now you will see the hydraulic systems
there are all the hydraulic systems that go in there
and trying to move one of those tires by yourself is a chore
it will get you in shape
rolling that thing around at the cape will get you in shape
and it's the same thing
it's a split wheel that we have
this one has the same problem
you cannot see it but it is right there
there is a big piece gone from right there
and again it's the runway
if you hit the runway on the high coarseness this is what you get
i'm going to show you the runway here in just a minute or a little sketch of it and you'll be able to see it but you can see that that is a fairly big strut
and we needed it
how much travel does the strut have
you mean after it's down and locked
oh i would say probably six inches to a foot just depending on which ones that rockwell picked
i'm not sure which one they have now
we had a pretty stiff strut to start with
i think they've done a little work on that
that's a good question by the way
that does affect it a whole lot because you don't want to drop that gear too low because those doors are open
if you drop that gear too low and that strut goes up you're going to get those doors and there goes that turnaround time we were talking about
there goes the turnaround time
i've got another one of my goodies here
this is not the beryllium
the beryllium had one big problem
we thought that the heat transfer was great but the homogeneity of the heating was not good
you would get spots
once you did that it would warp the brake
when it warped the break then it would do all sorts of bad things
when you look at this here are the stators and here are the rotors
this was a stator
and what this is is they had two sets of stators on each of these
and then of course the rotor went all the way around
but here is a brake
and you will see that it's only a piece of a brake
and you are going to find out it is very very heavy
and there is really not much i could tell you about these except that the one good thing we did was we insisted that rockwell leave enough room in here for five stators and rotors
we started with four and right now we have five
and so we did it partially right anyway to start with
here is the axel and this will fit on all of these
and we thought we did about twenty five stops with this thing but i think we probably end up somewhere between four and ten
again that's just money
and again that's the turnaround time we were talking about
so all of the things we thought we could do systems engineering things did not work out quite right
so the stators had to pass
yeah
the caliber just pushes against it
just pushes yeah
it just shoves it
there is the caliber so you just close that thing up and you just squeeze those guys together and you watch the smoke come out
did the caliber float at all like on a modern one
we found that we had to do an orphus hydraulic system
we found out the problem you're talking about they had a funny name for it but it was the one you're getting at
and what was happening is that the brake was cycling because it was not orphused
once we orphused that thing it worked very very smooth
and just like your front wheels it just doesn't look much different than your front wheels except they are a lot bigger
and how would you like to have that pad on your car
you would never have to have them replaced
here you go
this is a mechanical engineers' dream
here are more linkages than you could ever want
you can have all sorts of fun with this kind of linkage
this is the forward part of the orbiter
the nose comes around kind of like that
and you can see that we've got that gear stuffed in there pretty good
and some of the things that are on the door are sliced out so when you look at the door in there you have just a whole lot of things in there
and what happens is remember i said the first thing is we have a little hydraulic actuator that starts this thing
and whether you want to or not it opens those doors
and we will fire this bungee right here
this is a pyrotechnic thing
and no matter what we are going to fire that thing to be sure that if the hydraulic system isn't going to that we are going to drop that thing with a pyro
so it opens the doors
once it opens and you start that gear down remember you've got about two hundred something knots of wind that is going to drop
so this is going to help you
it comes down it folds down that way
our only comment to rockwell was that we didn't like all this
the leakages were even more than that when we started and we had to reduce those down
there is a little fitting right up here that you can get a little bit of help to get the thing back up
but you do need the guys with their polls shoving it back up
there is the wheel
and once it's down there is no brake on that one
this is the forward one
this will give you a little better idea
this doesn't look too much different
forward is this way
if you go that way you see the gear has come down and is now locked into place
in the other picture you couldn't see these little yokes but when the strut comes up those yokes come up and grab it
there is the extender strut
essentially the drag shut it's a solid piece
i'm not sure what you could say other than the fact that that right there is the booster actuator that i was talking about the pyro actuator
and it is going to fire every time no matter what
the same thing for the mains except they are bigger
one problem we had with this particular one was these doors
those are big doors
they are bigger than probably two of these tables
maybe like that and wider so they are big
and the problem is sealing them
when you're coming in and you're going to re enter you've got to get a seal on there that is going to work
most of these were bolt seals
you just put the freon and they squeezed closed
there is no seal sticking out
of course it has got the re entry material on it
but again these were part of our problem
and those seals were probably the trickiest things that we had
and here professor is at extend retract actuator but it still won't do it all
you could hook up a hydraulic system to get this gear back up
forward is that way
but you need a lot of help
again it was a weight problem
i am going to show you this one but i had to go to the space center houston because i couldn't get a picture of the orbiter
so this is a little mockup
and here is the gear
and what i really want to show you is see that little guy right there that's the pyro system that kicked that thing out
they call it a bungee
it's a rockwell term but it's not like a bungee
it's really actually like a pyro
and when that strut comes back up here are those yokes i was telling you about
it just clamps around that strut and it hold it up
that's probably the only thing you can see that is worthwhile on this picture
now we're going to talk a little bit about integration an interesting problem
rockwell was our prime integrator
they integrated everything
we helped them but they had all these people as contractors
not only did rockwell have to deal with us
rockwell had to deal with all these contractors that they had
the wheels were made by bf goodrich
not goodyear goodrich which is now michelin i think
and they flew it on the f fourteen and c five a which is a pretty big airplane
we didn't have a four wheel truck like the big aircraft did like a seven hundred forty seven
we thought that would be a great idea but we didn't have the room in there to put the whole thing in
the brakes were bf goodrich the same ones
they were the ones that really wanted to go with a beryllium
it turned out that they passed all of the initial tests for the beryllium but the beryllium had no life so we never really had a test failure
but we had a test of things we really didn't like the way it was going so we changed
they changed i think in one thousand nine hundred ninety or one thousand nine hundred eighty five to the carbon brake that i was showing you just a minute ago
the nose gear steering is a bi steeror
nose gear steering is after you land and you get the nose gear down you can steer
it turns out that the astronauts did not like to use the nose gear steering so what they would do is get on the brakes
they would do the brakes like this
and they'd steer that way
when you do that you heat those brakes up pretty good
you heat the brakes up
and besides that there was a single point failure in that nose gear steering
if that thing failed and it failed in a bad position it might be nine degrees off and so you're going to run the orbiter off there
i had to agree with the astronauts that probably the right thing to do was just get on those brakes and steer with those guys
menasco they built struts for almost everybody
hydroair they had all kinds of actuators
and rockwell did all the bar linkages that i was showing you about
the antiskid system was another one of those important things
what is it on your cars these days
the abs system
this is our abs system right here
and we had one
and we had nose gear steering
we had all that good stuff
you've got to remember now this is thirty years ago so it's a little different
there we go
i had to put that in there
i like this picture
there is nothing technical about it but i like it
isn't that neat
look at those little skinny wheels on that big vehicle
isn't that something
it looks like somebody made a mistake
anyway it's coming in there
you will note there are no drag shoots
the initial design actually had a drag shoot
one of the guys in our division decided that we didn't need a drag shoot so he put in an improvement which reduced the cost
that was a mistake again so we took the drag shoot off
and i eventually had to put it back on anyway
all engineers are not exactly right but this thing flew well
the gears really worked out real well
we were tickled pink whenever we would see that thing fly
i may have already told you
i had to put that in there
i like that picture
this was a dilemma
the tires never really failed to the spec that we gave them
we didn't like it because we didn't think we would get the life that we wanted out of it
and so we had running discussions
maybe not battles but certainly running discussions with goodrich on that tire
we got excessive testing tire damage with a dynamometer test where you do all the testing and we put the side loads on
and we just didn't like what was happening
even though it passed this we went to say twenty percents over
we were really getting failures that we really didn't like
and we knew from the very beginning after the test that we were not going to get the five or six landings that we thought with every tire set
on the mains you'd get one landing and that's it
and you can see why you would get these big hunks
i think they are better with the new runway or with the way they fix the runway
i talked about the wheel
the wheel cracked
we had a wheel crack with a load
the bolt lubricant did not work
we couldn't get the right torque
the two o rings caused a failure in the split wheel
the bolts broke and we failed the one thousand mile test
that doesn't sound great does it
but it really was because this was an empirical design
it worked fine because it met the spec that we had
and what drives you as engineers you might not like it but program managers have their problems too
they have costs they have to worry about they've got schedules they have got to worry about and they get you to do things that will work every time
and then later on you can make the improvements
the beryllium brakes we had cracked hot spots on the pad we had thermal expansion and some melting
goodrich kept telling us that those cracks did not matter for flight but we didn't like it and we fussed with them a lot
and we fussed with rockwell a lot
and after maybe ten years they finally changed them
the entry displacement was lower than expected
we thought sure that the beryllium would be a great way to do it and it didn't work out
and i talked to you a little bit about the hydraulic system causing that wobble
that was the test results on our outline
let's talk a little bit about the runway
i have more goodies for you
the runway was about fifteen thousand feet at the cape
before the flight test how do you actual simulate flight conditions especially with the wings to simulate heat dissipation
you mean dropping the gear
yeah
i don't think we ever really did
i don't think we ever had a wind load on it
but we tested that gear
one time we did it with a lower pressure just to see if the hydraulic pressure would work
and that may give us a little bit of something but that's all we ever did
we had high confidence in that pyro
if you ever heard it go off
but you rely on the wing load to dissipate the heat right
one of the things yeah
and gravity of course
you're getting a gravity down too on the thing
so you're getting wind you're getting gravity you're getting pyro you're getting hydraulic
no to dissipate the heat in the brakes
not the gear but to dissipate the heat from the brakes you rely on the wing load
oh sure
but you couldn't test that on the ground
i don't think we ever put it in a wind tunnel or anything
if we did i don't remember
but we did check a lot to see what the heating was
and we did it on a dynamometer which is like you do to your car tires
no i don't think we ever did
that's a good question
i wonder why we didn't do that
i had to think about that one
here is the runway
a lot of people in nasa have built runways and looked at them
and what they did is they put these grooves in there to get the water off just like they do on the highways now
and you will see that is the grooved runways right there
it sits in there about like that
and i will pass this around and let you see it
and you will see that it is really rough
and you can see hitting that surface at those speeds is not really good
what they have done after i left by the way which is a great thing to do is they shortened the high friction part of the runway and they pinned it with like a ball pinned hammer
they pinned it like they do highways
that got our friction factor down
we missed the friction factor by the way
and they put a thing called a corduroy on the front
and here is the corduroy
you want to take a look at that
it's like that
and so now the runway looks like this
i think if we were going to fly the orbiter some more that probably with this runway now at the cape we would probably get a little better use out of the tires
it turns out that trying to determine the friction factor here was not as easy as we thought
and you will see when you see that the thing is not a smooth surface
it's a pitted surface and it has little things that stick up
and so if you pin it down like you do like a highway and get that it's much better
we've gone through the requirements
we've gone through some of the testing
now let's talk about operational findings that we found on this thing
remember if you're going to be an engineer which you are i hope you're going to find out that all three of these things will be a problem for you
you'll have to look at the requirements you will have to look at the testing and you will have to look at the operations of the thing
if you work for a company they will put you way ahead if you tell them we ought to go find out how this thing is operating with our customers
here is what we found
our deployment velocity when we dropped the gear on landing was three hundred twelve knots operational
good
we were right on
landing velocity was two hundred twenty five
we actually came in once at two hundred thirty two or a little higher than that
and that was the marine landing
i'm not quite sure he was wanting to do those carrier landings
the operational weight was higher
we designed for two hundred fourteen to two hundred thirty
we ended up with about two hundred twenty five to two hundred thirty two which is not bad because we had enough margin in those tires and wheels to take it
the sink rates were not bad six point seven is about what they would always land at which was really pretty good
now you can see that our design was not that far off
the negative angle of attack i want to talk about here
let me show you it
for some reason the initial design which i guess we were all part of had a negative angle of attack if you would take this route
it was about four degrees down like that
now if you take a look at this when you come in here you will see that if you're going to get a load in your landing so the elevons are going to be up a little bit what you're going to do is all those loads are going to dump right straight into that back gear
and that's really not what you want
you ask yourself well why don't you just raise this gear
and the answer is money and weight
but the initial thought was we ought to have it to look like that and do that and we will take the load off the brakes
i'm not sure that was one of our better moves but that wasn't bad
we talked a little bit about this
the nose gear steering was never really used
i'm not sure they do it now
oh no they fixed it
have they fixed it
yeah they use it
in fact it was after our flight
that is when they finally decided to fix it
we're going to talk about his flight in just a minute here
i went through great lengths to get his
we had one tire failure on fifty one d
and after our operations we did find that we could get john young who was chief astronaut at the time to say yes we're going to change how we do these elevons on landing so we will take some of the load off that gear
let's review it
we had the requirements we had the design we had the test results and now we've got the operational results
the whole systems engineering scheme is to go from start to finish
and this is what we did
i may have made this sound more negative than it was
it was great fun and it worked really well
i mean it worked well
as an example and what the professor was talking about a minute ago we did one of these
this is loads here but we did one for heating early on
and we had a little computer which was one of the few on the center at the time
it was a wang desktop
they've never seen that
i know that
it's a foreign word
it's about this big
and i think it had a max of about two hundred fifty six k and that was it
we to keep up with rockwell instead of loads did heating because we were more worried about the brakes than we were the tires
and if you look at this curve this one sets that nose gear down a little early
you come in on the mains and you drop that nose gear down
and then all of a sudden you get this spike
well you can imagine if you get this spike here the heating is going to be higher from there on
if you keep that nose up like he was talking about a minute ago and you just wait a while and you get way down the runway or down the runway some place you get a little lower load and it's a little easier on those tires and on the brakes
it gives you a little longer rollout but that's not bad because we've got plenty of room
now some of these fellows had a problem with this one
this is fifty one d
this is the infamous flight for the professor
see that tire right there
it is blown
it is the only tire that we blew in the whole of the flight test
and what are we at two hundred ten or two hundred fourteen along flights and it is the only tire
i'm sorry one hundred fourteen
it's the only tire that we blew
and i tried to ask him last night what they did
i'll tell the story
well i was going to tell you he had a tremendous side load
he had a tremendous fifteen knot crosswind that they got
and the gentleman who was flying was a fellow named bobko
he's kind of fun to talk to
he did a good job getting that thing in
and they got pretty far down the runway
i think it was only two hundred feet our guys told me before that tire blew
and you were almost at a stop
you were just going a little slow
but the brakes were heating up because he was on those brakes fighting that side load
more operational findings
we shot blasted the center strip at the runway
we improved the groves like i was showing you and we put the corduroy in
and that all happened after i was there but i still deal with the guys out in the center and they helped me out to get this
the design problem was the wing volume that we had
we started forty two
they tell me they are going to go to forty four
i don't know if they have
the tire pressure was three hundred seventy
we could go to four hundred ten
i think the new tire will have four hundred ten
we talked a little bit about lengthening the nose gear which would relieve some of that problem with the nose down
it turned out the proposal was prepared
it was presented
and they decided that they really didn't want to do it because it would cost too much money and was too much weight
the orbiter at one time had a cg problem
and i don't think they wanted to weight up there with that much of a moment arm on it was one of the reasons
the carbon brakes were added in one thousand nine hundred ninety
they worked great
the new synthetic tire in one thousand nine hundred ninety two which is different from that tire right there worked very very well
the drag shoot
we put the drag shoot back on
and this is nothing more but a picture but there is that drag shoot right there
we have that drag shoot on now
and they tell me that helps a lot
if you put that drag shoot on you save the brakes and you save those tires too
and it also tends to stabilize you to keep it going straight down the runway
even with the crosswind
even with the crosswind yeah
and you have to realize that this has to be designed not just for a landing at kennedy space center or at edwards where you have a three mile long runway
like allen said you've got contingency runways around the world where you might be landing with just two miles
and that is when this stuff is really going to save your bacon
we were proponents of the drag shoot for a long time mainly to save those tires and the brakes and get the cost back in there
it was added in one thousand nine hundred ninety two
and so with all of that
after i told you all of that i was a little bit negative just to let you know that everything doesn't go smooth
if it does not go smoothly when you do engineering i would suggest to you that you're probably going to have the same kind of situations
just concluding comments
the tire design on development had margins to meet all the initial requirements and they did fine
it is still flying and flies well a good vehicle
we only had one tire failure and the professor was a witness there he was there
we could have had a longer life on all that but the clear issue was really weights and money
again it is one of those systems engineering things where you have to trade that off
the wheels performed a design
even better because we didn't have any leakage in six months on the pad which was great for us
the beryllium brakes functioned but were sporadically marginal
the ksc runway had friction and rough surfaces but that is fixed so everything is pretty good now
the initial design of the requirements and improvements have continued and i am sure that they will continue until the orbiter doesn't fly anymore
and i am going to stop right there
you've had enough of me for a little bit
any questions on this stuff
what did you think about that concrete
did you pass that stuff around
isn't that something
it fools you doesn't it
i had never been to the cape
it is a lot rougher than you think
and you see that stuff and say what were we thinking
that's no good for a big tire like that
ok gang
i will just finish the story of this fifty one d flight that allen mentioned
it was the sixteenth flight of the shuttle
it was my first flight
and actually there were seven people onboard
six of us were rookies so we had never been in space before
and the commander had only been in space once and he was in charge
and it was quite an exciting flight because we had a malfunctioning satellite we had to do an unplanned spacewalk
we did an unplanned rendezvous with a satellite
and so lots of stuff had happened
and then we came in re entry
and i just remember the deal was as allen said the nose wheel steering was built in but it was a single string system
there was only one hydraulic loop in the nose gear
and if that went hard over then you will leave the runway
and so gastros decided that until they made that redundant we weren't going to use the nose wheel steering
in order to steer down the runway you put even more or less pressure on the right or the left brake
it turned out that we landed with the max crosswind
we had a crosswind from the right side i believe and so wanted to blow the orbiter over to the left side of the runway
and so the commander had to put extra brakes on the right wheel
and so that was what was heating up
and i just remember because i was sitting right behind him up on the flight deck we touched down everything went fine down the runway the nose wheel came down and we could feel the deceleration
i thought we were just about stopped
and i remember thinking to myself it's all over nothing can go wrong now
boom the whole orbiter shook
i mean i really thought that one of the fuel tanks had blown up or something
it was really impressive
and like allen said these things put out a lot of shrapnel
in fact after most flights sometimes you will see the crew get out and walk around and kind of kick the tires and just sort of pat the orbiter and say thank you for a nice flight and all that
but they made everybody get out of there because the other tires obviously were overheated as well and they were worried that they were break
but as yogi bear said it ain't over till it's over
and it was exciting
but after that they fixed the nose wheel steering they got rid of the beryllium brakes and replaced them with carbon they put in the drag shoot and we really haven't had any problems since
and i think it's a really good example of the whole engineering process where you build in margin
and that is absolutely critical when you're designing a system
and then going through the testing and then the operation and then closing the loop
once you find out how these systems really operate then if you have the ability to make changes you can go in and improve them
let's take our two minute break stand up turn around and then we'll take up again with the manipulator systems
start up again with a different mechanical system
in this case the manipulator system which is the space crane
that's a good term for it
it is a space crane
this is a whole different way we did this
when the orbiter was built there were several sized payload bays
one was thirty feet and one was sixty feet
and it turned out that we did not really have a system to handle the payload where you were going to carry the payload but we really didn't have them at the time
altitude and inclination varied
here was the significant capability we had to do
we had to do sixty five thousand pounds fifteen foot in diameter and about sixty feet long
that is about the size of a greyhound bus
and we really did not have any system to handle it
the thoughts were don't worry we will spring it out we'll throw it out but we had no retrievalment methods
besides that another systems engineering problem most of the resources in the program were on the orbiter or just to get the shuttle flying
and there was really not a lot of attention paid to the payloads in the early days
in addition to that when you look back the ongoing programs were skylab
we had skylab still going
we had apollo soyez just about ready to fly
and then the prime objective the orbiter
all these things contributed to the fact that it was a little later in getting this started than perhaps it should have been
all the nasa centers had a concept
marshall had a concept
we did not have a concept at johnson at the time
we were doing some off line work on manipulators but the initial part was not for the shuttle
we had some systems that were pretty good for deployment but we had no system for retrieval at the time
that was a problem
the manipulator became a crane
it essentially became a contender once we understood a little bit more about the requirements
and the one that came up that said we have to go capture a satellite
that is the one that was the real driver for the manipulator
we had some studies going on
i guess you guys call it robotics
and we had found that we could get from general electric some of the atomic energy commission which they used to handle the very critical elements
and we were just working on it
and this was a side issue
we were doing this technology
it had nothing to do with the orbiter at the time
and we decided after a while that we liked the way it worked and what we would do is just make an extension of that so we did
and we decided that we would try to go to handling system
and we did
i'm not sure
is master slave a good term for robotics these days
let me tell you what a master slave is
the hand controllers or whatever you're using looks just like the manipulator
you have a little bitty one over here
you've got a big one over here
we were using a master slave kind of system
and we found out right off that if you've made an arm that long and you try to put it in the crew cabin it took up a lot of volume in the crew cabin
and so we didn't have that much room to start with
that became an issue right off
the other issue was that we found out that when we were working with the aec kind of things that dexterity and feedback was very important because they didn't want to drop this thing
they wanted to be sure they could handle it
but we really didn't need that
we decided that we had to have a larger system than that
and we also found that during these tests the fellow would hold his arms up and would get tired
we decided if we got a barber he would be the guy that could operate this thing better than any of us
that's a one g problem
even there for training he would get tired so easily
but we never found a barber that could do it
and we kept the master slave concept for future testing
just so we understand what a master slave is let's take a quick look at this
here is the master
you can go over and grab the hand controller right up here
and as you move that hand controller this piece over here moves exactly like you move the hand controller and the arm
now that is interesting because if this is one foot and that is fifty feet you get a radio of about one point fifty
instead of being able to move it like we wanted you now have to ratchet the thing every time you did it
it took more space
so we decided that really was not a good idea
in addition to that we found that the manipulator that we had was really too small for what we really wanted to do
and the other problem was that the ge hydraulic manipulator was probably not what we were going to fly in space
we did not want to fly a hydraulic system that would leak
now we had a problem between hydraulics and electrics which now we had to do some modeling on
of all things we had some money from the nasa medical group
we told them what we wanted to do they gave us some money and we went and bought a manipulator from ge
they got it from pittsburg plate and glass
it was about twenty five to twenty seven feet long and it had a suction end effector on it
and what they would do is pick up these big pieces of glass and move them
we bought their manipulator for about dollars fifty point zero i think but it was medical money of all things
and it had a master slave and it had a vacuum end detector
we decided that there were several things that we had to analyze just to get this thing started
one was the master slave and we decided we wanted an alternate concept
that one didn't even work
the feedback versus fixed hand controllers was the other one
a lot of people wanted feedback
do you do robotics with feedback too
any of you in robotics
i can tell you anything can't it
well we didn't think we need it
the viewing the line of site turned out to be another issue
when you look at it in the orbiter we had it at the aft station
and looking back at the time there were no windows facing out
what we did for the first time was put tvs on the orbiter to use it
so the initial test was to see if we could do things with the tvs
we decided that was an issue
the end effector configuration was really never solved until about the end and that's the thing that is the grabber that you have to grab this thing with
and the power source we got fairly early
we did not want to use hydraulics
the other thing was the tip speed and that is the speed at which the tip of the manipulator has to move so you can do things with it
the problem we had is if we are going to capture a satellite and we had a relative velocity between the orbiter and a satellite since the guy was going to have to move this thing but we didn't have a requirement so we had to go work on that
payload and cargo handling was the other
we knew that we were going to handle sixty four thousand pounds
and the manipulators we were working on weren't going to do it
and of course the satellite capturing and retrieval was what i've already talked about
we did a little modeling and converted some things at the center
we decided that we had to have a high bay a big room so we got a room that was building thirteen and we built a plastic floor that was very smooth and put payloads on air bearings
and then we mounted our manipulator right next to it
then what we would do is on the air bearing floor everybody would push this five thousand or six thousand pound payload across the floor
and we had two strips where we could get the velocity of what was going
and we decided that we would try to find out what the tip speed had to be to capture at certain velocities so we did that
and we just had very very simple minded effectors but it worked fairly good
we also worked on stationary
these payloads right here after using this floor for probably a year and a half we came up with some requirements
we couldn't use a master slave
the feedback didn't really help us
it was just too big
tell you what if you ever look at the linemen these days that go up and fix these high lines their manipulator their system is similar to what we have
we have a little bit more sophistication in the avionics but it is very very similar
mechanically they are very very similar
the line of site would be required
we had an astronaut come over and use the manipulator
we gave him a tv and then put what it is called an eye mark recorder on his head
and what this eye mark record was is it looked into your eyes and when you looked at something out here on a tv over here you could see where he was looking
then we ran a test to see while he was operating to capture these satellites whether he was looking at the satellite i'm sorry the tv or while he was going line of sight
it turned out it was very interesting it was sixty percents he was looking line of sight and forty percents on the tv
at the time there was no aft window so we went to rockwell and they decided to put the aft windows
again here is one of those problems
the aft window is about that thick
it pure quartz and is very very heavy
and nobody wanted to put them in
i think we had some overhead windows in to start with
i'm not real sure about that
but we have overhead windows in there and aft windows
so we got those put in
we also defined the end effector speed the tip speed
we found out that about foot per second was about all he needed
other than that probably the satellite was moving so fast and it probably wasn't safe to do it so we settled on that
we decided that we could capture satellites
that was done
and we again said we could not see using hydraulics on this system at all
so we moved to a bigger building
now we built a sixty point eighty foot floor and ran satellites across it a very smooth floor
the smoothness of the floor we had a little hole in the middle that was zero point nine inches deep and we shot the whole thing with a laser and got the floor built
we also needed an orbiter mockup so we built an orbiter mockup to about where it would be on the orbiter
we got the floor built
that should be eighty
the manipulator was now fifty feet long so we had to make it fifty feet long
but the problem was since we were going to use the electrical system instead of the hydraulic system now we had to make that hydraulic system think it was operating like an electrical system
what we did was on the electrical system if you put the arm straight out and you lift it we had a first cut at one hundred pounds
now in orbit it is inertia that is going to get you but on the ground we said we will hold this thing out at one hundred pounds for the electrical system
so we modeled the hydraulic system to work just like that
also we needed a lower scale payload
we did not have any
remember what i was telling you a minute age sixty feet by fifteen feet is about the size of a greyhound bus
was what we were trying to work on
and we also went to a fixed hand controller which drove us into the hydraulics business
i'm sorry into the avionics business
before we did that we had to figure out a way to handle payloads
and so what we did was we had looked up some of these people who were loggers up in the northeast and they were using essentially a dirigible to take the logs down
and they were big about like what we wanted
we got that company sheldahl i think was the company to build this thing and put helium in it
and it turned out something this big has a tremendous inertia which was great because that was what we wanted
we didn't want it to be heavy but we wanted the inertia
plus we got a little resistance from the air when we moved it around
we had to take that one and show that we could grab it and put it in the payload bay
and that took a while because when you get it all set around when you start putting it down near the payload bay say there is the aft station of the payload bay you find out that you cannot see anything
now you really are on the tvs and you really have to get that manipulator where it knows where it is
that was the other thing
we found that once you started drop some of these payloads you will want to automate a whole bunch of this stuff
in addition to that when you look at the requirements just putting it in the payload bay is kind of interesting but once you get it in there you've got to hold it
what we did is there is the trunnion right there
you can see right there is where the trunnion goes in there
this thing comes back it opens up and it's like a big latch
if you can drop that thing in there you can just put it in there
now that is not so easy so i will show you
we built some guides
but the other thing was none of the payloads were all the same size
what we had to do is this is the longeron right there
there is that longeron in there
and so we had these bridge fittings that you could move along and move all along the payload bay
now anybody that came along with any kind of size of payload we could now accommodate those fellows
and it worked fairly well
and we had done that
the other part was once you got the trunnion latch you had to get this thing in there
what we did was we tried a lot of schemes but this was one that worked
let me start with this side
there is the trunnion
that is essentially these guys right here
those are the trunnions
when you look at the trunnion it sticks out of there and it just drops down into the payload bay and it goes into that latch
but getting it into that latch is not that easy because you really cannot see sometimes
what we did was built a thing called a v guide
this is the v guide right here
and the v guide over here is right there
and then we have a scuff plate so that once you drop it in the v guide this scuff plate kept the payload from hitting up against that latch
and they are still using the same concept
here is what we really went with
not master slave anymore
i'm sure in robotics labs or something you probably go to hand controllers like this
we went out and looked at a lot of the cranes that people work with and we found out that these three motors right here all were parallel their rotation was parallel
what we did was put sort of the auxiliary placement things outside those three things just the way the linemen do out there now
they do not have a hand controller
they have a switch box or they have little handles that they use
that is essentially the configuration that we started with on there
and if you look at it this is a little more complex
and about this time we had had enough work with the manipulator that we had that we had built in house a fifty foot model that we could use and prove to the program office that we could handle the payloads
we had the big inflatables we had the air bearing floor and so the shuttle program manager said we're going to go with it
and the air force wants it so we're going to use it
at about that time the canadians decided they wanted to be in the space and they are the ones who came and asked us could they build it
and people in washington said yes so our division kind of backed off for a while and they formed a program office with the canadians
actually that is a canadian arm called the canada arm
well you know you've got to have everything
this is the longeron in the orbiter
this right here is the longeron in the orbiter
and these are just little sort of wrists and they will latch it in
and you can see that we got the tvs here
i think that probably this gives you a little better feel for the rotation
we had one rotation that the first thing we had to do was because when the payload bay doors closed they closed on top of this thing so what you had to do was roll the manipulator out because we had to get it out of the way so there would be no interference with the payload bay doors
there is a degree of freedom that is really just repositions the thing
and then after that there is five degrees of freedom on there at least
and if you start from the back here that first joint is a yaw
and then all three of these center joints are translation
and then there is a roll up here and there is a pitch up here
we could go to any place with the end effector if we had the tip speed and we had enough joints
the problem was that when we did this and we tried to build some gear trains and we found out that you didn't want to back drive this arm
you caught something and it back drives
we did that a lot with the inflatables
if you use spur gears you would strip the gears out so we went to roller gears or essentially the planetary type gears
i think the canadians now have all these interior angles or all those roller gears
in the interest of time since i am going on here is the manipulator and this is the aft station
and i have a little better one of that
but about the time that we were just about to get this thing proven we found out that people in the world were very interested in this
we had a russian general want to come see us so we said ok and we entertained the russian general
we wanted to show him that even though the arm was about forty feet long that we were very dexterous so we were going to pour him a glass of water
and we did except when we got the general there and i walked in they had the glass but the water wasn't in what i thought it was in
it was in a vodka bottle
and there is no liquor allowed on a federal installation
and i'm sitting there and the guide is looking at me and i'm saying there goes that job
i told the general his interpreter hold your glass there so that you got the bottle
real nice
the guy was really good at the manipulator
he poured it in there
fortunately it was water
but we actually poured a glass of water out of vodka bottle for the general
but i thought my time at nasa had come to an end
you guys wouldn't do that would you
no
it would have been vodka
yeah they'd use the vodka
nowadays they might use the vodka
i hadn't thought about that
well let me go on here
i was going to point out one thing here that the tvs turn out to be a very important part of this whole thing
once you get a payload and you sort of are blind now you have lots of tvs you can use
there are four on orbiter
there are two up front two on the back bulked and there is one on the end effector so that you can sort of see where you're going for the last engagement
and you can see here there is the aft station there are the windows
now he's got a pretty good line of site if there is nothing in there
if there is a docking tunnel in there that makes it a little more difficult
did you have a docketing tunnel
you just had a place where you could set it
my favorite thing for this gentleman is that fixing the hubble to me was the greatest thing that we have ever done
and i hope they do it again some time
and the manipulator always plays a part in that
the only other thing that we did that was interesting early on we built an end effector where the astronaut could stand on it
our first cut at this was to do it like the guys that do the high lines and we put all the controls out on the end effector
the canadians did not like that
it complicated things
remember we only had about one hundred twenty kilobytes total for the computer for this thing and that was it
they didn't want to waste any more and they didn't want all the weight
i guess the astronauts or someone said we'll go with just a foot stand and then we will control it from the aft station here
and i think that's the way you do it now isn't it
yeah
it was a tough battle but weight and cost won out again
it's tough to beat them
these aren't really that great but you can see that this thing takes up a lot of control panel in the aft station of the orbiter
it really does
and here are the windows right there
and there is an overhead window
we thought at one time that what we would have to do the arm is here this aft there was a payload that wanted the arm to come back this way
if it did that you had to have that window
a very strange thing happened because when you turn your arm back that way right is left and left is right
we had to practice the reverse of everything or get a mirror or something
we tried a lot of it
the program office wisely decided that was not a good idea so they were going to handle that payload another way
i wish i could remember exactly what it was
there are two hand controller here and here they are right here
this was a lot more fun than wheels brakes and tires
this was a fun project
and this is the translation controller
you've operated this one
and there is the rotational hand controller
this one on the left essentially operates the three center joints where it goes like that
and then all the others are done with this hand controller
i think those are pretty normal flight controllers aren't they
those are the ones you used
at least we thought it was
the biggest argument we had with the canadians was this the end effector
that is the hand the thing that grabs it
we wanted one that was more dextrose
they argued and rightfully so that what we really wanted was one that would make a good sturdy latch
and this one does
the way this works is that there are three little wires in here three cables that come in so once this end effector is placed over this grapple pin here these wires close
and as they close they also move back and they grab on the end of that pin right there and pull this end effector into this shoulder right here
now in the meantime there is a docking target that he looks at that he can see
now once it sits on this shoulder that really is a good structural latch
you've got a great structural latch
and if this indexes you can also make an electrical connection across there which some payload is willing to do
now you make a capture latch which is essentially the way you do docking a lot of times
you make a capture latch with these wires that actually just close around this thing
then it pulls it back sets it on these shoulders and now you have a nice sturdy thing
and the canadians did a good job there
i have to tell them that
the problem with that is the one we had on the nose of your steering
we had ten single point failures in there which makes you nervous particularly if you're hauling a big payload or an expensive payload
however they did a good job
reliability has never failed that i know of so that was a good thing that they did
this was a lot more fun than the wheels brakes and tires guys
then the only other thing is we had a backup mode
we were afraid
at the time we weren't that enthused with computers so we wanted a backup mode
so we got everybody to go to a single joint mode
what we did was hardwired all the joints and put a box on the control panel so you could move each joint singularly
and that was the backup mode
you can do it with a single joint or you can do it computer supported
you can do it either way
and we also had to have a jettison mode
if this thing stuck out there you would have to throw it overboard because you couldn't close the doors
we had to get rid of it
the canadians thought that was not a good idea
ok last bit
this was a different project from the other one i was talking to you about
this one did not start with any history at all
we really had to start this one from scratch
it is probably one of those things that came along just at the right time
and we were studying some technology
and we had enough sense to convert but it essentially is just a big crane
i think that the thing that surprised us the most was this one right here
the crew took to this very very easily
it took very little for them to do it
as a matter of fact our simulator in building nine a became a trainer forum
we were still doing development work
and they said no we're going to make this a trainer
and those guys were pretty good
they came in in very very little time
we had to do this
this was that inflatable testing
remember on our other project i said you've got to do the testing you've got to prove the requirements
here was one where we did a little bit of innovation with that big inflatable to show that we could meet the requirements
and we did
and surprisingly and happily working with the canadians was great fun
it was the first time i had ever worked with any of the internationals but it was great fun
and they did a great job on this thing
they are still upgrading it
it is still flying
and i'm taking up all your time i'm going to take up
just one or two things in finishing up
allen talked a lot about the importance of testing
and this was a challenge with the arm because remember all the stuff that we did with the inflatables that was all done with a hydraulic arm
the actual arm with the electric motors was incapable of lifting its own weight in the earth's gravity
i remember going once up to the factory in canada and the only testing that they could really do they had a big air bearing floor up there
and they could use the electrical arm but only in two dimensions
and so it didn't get its full three dimensional testing until sts three the third orbital flight test where they had the arm on
and that was the first real use where they could put it through all the paces
but it really has worked well
and in fact you've all seen the picture of the astronaut bruce mccandless and the manned maneuvering unit flying off by himself
that has become like an icon
the reason that was originally built and fielded was because people didn't think that the manipulator arm would actually have the capability of grabbing onto a moving or rotating satellite
and so the idea was that the astronauts would have to go and catch it and then fly it or stabilize it so that you could come pick it up with the manipulator
but on the solar maximum repair actually it turned out that they couldn't catch it with the manipulator because there was a configuration problem and they couldn't latch it
and so they actually had to go after it with the manipulator arm while it was spinning and they were able to get it
and in fact a lot of work that we did in simulators showed that the manipulator had a lot better capability than we originally thought it would
that was joe allen right
well it was terry hart who actually caught it
terry hart
there was pinky nelson who went out
joe and dale went out to get
these were not big astronauts
they were a couple of the smaller guys
anyway just to end the moral of this is there is a lot of discussion often about humans and robots and who should be doing what
and i think a lot of people don't realize that from the very beginning we have actually had a human robotic interaction on the shuttle
and particularly for eva activities it has allowed and i will be talking about this later in the term
we get humans and robotic systems working together
now granted these are teleoperated robotic systems
the real hardcore roboticists don't call it robotics unless it's autonomous
but nevertheless it is a telerobotic system that we use in combination with humans
and it has given us very great capabilities
ok we will see you on thursday
let's see
oh there is a lot of stuff
oms rcs fuel cells auxiliary power unit and hydraulic systems
and also we will be looking for the outline the first cut on your reports
henry will reveal you with all of that
and let's thank allen
thank you
well it's my privilege to introduce henry pohl today
henry has been a longtime colleague of mine working in the early days of apollo and shuttle
he is an old country boy but he has created more innovative designs on technical problems than anybody i know
and we will try to bring some of those out because he has really created some very innovative solutions to technical problems
and i am going to set henry up a little bit so let me set the stage for you a little bit
i was manager of the space shuttle orbiter and the engineers came to me and said aaron the waste management system on the shuttle is not working very well
now the waste management system in simple terms is the toilet
they said the toilet is not working very well and we really need to go off and design a new toilet
i thought for a moment well that's probably a pretty important thing to do so we did
well it turns out the original contract and i am quoting a little bit from memory was about dollars ten million
now dollars ten million for a toilet when you can go down to any place and get a toilet for a couple hundred dollars is a pretty high number
but that wasn't the worst of it
the worst of it about six months later they came to me and said aaron guess what
it's not dollars ten million
it's dollars twenty million
congress got wind of this and wanted me to come up and testify
and you can see what kind of fun they are going to have
waste management they're really going to have fun with this subject
and you may know some people in congress but the name was mister sensenbrenner from wisconsin
i remember very clearly
he is still in congress now
he was head of the science committee and that is who we had to go testify for
well there was a reporter for the washington post
her name was kathy sawyer
now kathy was the science reporter for the washington post
very very good
kathy was very smart very fair but she really bore in on things
kathy got wind of this so she wanted to publish an article on it
she called me and said would you please talk to me about the waste management system
i said boy she is going to get me in trouble
i said i will tell you what i've got somebody that could really tell you about the waste management system and i will have henry pohl call you
i talked to henry about it
now that is going to be henry's introduction to this class of what he told kathy sawyer because it is a classic
henry it is all yours
aaron almost forgot about kathy sawyer
kathy called me up and said can you explain to me how i might explain to my neighbor's fourteen year old daughter why nasa has spent dollars ten million building a toilet
and i said i will try
and i thought for a little bit on how am i going to start out on this
i said you know if you take the commode that you've got in your bathroom and you bolt it upside down on the ceiling now try using it
i said that is really a little better situation than we have on the orbiter because at least we know which way the gravity field is on that
in orbit you don't know
most of the time you don't have any but it might be to the right or left or up or down
you know that was the only reporter that i ever talked to it that put everything down verbatim of what i said the questions she asked and what i said and printed that article in the newspaper
but that kind of sets a stage for operating in the absence of gravity
i explained to her that the space shuttle volume that the people had to live in is about the same volume as you have in a modern bathroom
if you look at a bathroom with a shower and a room just outside with a sink and everything we have just about that same volume in the shuttle
now you seal that all up you've got a certain amount of air that you can use in there and you only have the air to replace gravity
you've got to have a flow of air to direct whatever you want to direct in a certain direction
you use that air
you run it through
you've got to deodorize it
you've got to clean it
you've got to run it back into the cabin almost instantly
otherwise you pull the vacuum in the cabin
and so whenever you start putting all of that equipment in there and all that stuff in there on something that has never been done before dollars ten million or dollars twenty million is kind of cheap when you get right down to it
you look at the number of people that that will hire for a year working on it is cheap
but to try to get that message across is not easy
go ahead and give me my first slide
let me just tell you another one since aaron got me off on a tangent here
the chicago tribune called me one day when we had a problem on shuttle and she was badmouthing the shuttle
and all she wanted to do was get a comment out of me that i agreed with something that she said since she could quote it
and i said i don't agree with you
i said you know that orbiter is really a pretty good vehicle when you look at what it has to do
i said you realize when it's in orbit it is going eight times faster than a bullet when it leaves the muzzle of a thirty six
silence on the other end
what's a thirty six
well i knew that wasn't a good example
but i told her that is a military rifle that was used in the second world war
and i used to fire that thing in the desert
and i could pull the trigger and see that bullet hit the ground out of that three hundred yards almost instantly
now that shuttle is going eight times faster than that
and i could see the headlines in the chicago tribune the shuttle flies eight times faster than a bullet
long silence
she said maybe i ought to find something else to write about
i said why
she said i don't think i have a story here
well it wasn't a story because it wasn't negative
kathy sawyer was the only time i ever got a good story from the press
i want you all to feel free to ask questions
i'm here more to talk about what you're interested in talking about than my thoughts so feel free to ask questions any time
i would like to talk about a half an hour
somebody is going to have to tell me when a half an hour is up
and then i would like to have some time for some questions
my first involvement in the space shuttle was max faget kind of came up with this idea of a winged vehicle going into space
and we kicked it around for a while
and he formed a little committee very small about twenty people as i recall
put the people in a room
he wanted to keep it quiet
he wanted to keep it secret until he got enough data so that he could know whether it was feasible or not
well they wanted me to send the best engineer i had over there
and he appointed a guy by the name of jim chamberlain to head up that group
i sent a guy over there
they closed the doors had a guard in front of the doors so nobody could come in no information could get out
on the third day jim chamberlain called me up and said i need to have a talk with my engineer
i said why
he said he balked
i said what do you mean he balked
he says henry you know what an old mule does when they balk don't you
i said yeah they won't go
he said well that's your mister kindrick he won't go
i called up my engineer and said what's going on over there girl
he said oh they don't know what they want
he said they gave me some requirements
i designed them an rcs system for it
they gave me another set of requirements
i designed another rcs system
they gave me some different requirements
i designed them a different rcs system
and then they came out with another set of requirements
i'm just going to wait until they decide what they want and then i'll design them an rcs system for it
well what he didn't understand was that's the way you go about setting the requirements
you get a small group of people together
you set down a set of requirements
you try to put a vehicle together and see where it punches out
usually weight cg something
so you change the requirements up a little bit and you design another system
you do that very quickly and you look at where that one punches out
and then you change your requirements again and you look at those requirements and where it punched out
the first requirements where it punched out
you change the requirements a little bit and see where it punches out
very very quickly you run through many configurations
that got the shuttle started
after it got started we kept changing the requirements as we went through the program
i would suggest that you understand your requirements very very clearly and the impact of your requirements very clearly
things like fail op fail safe or fail safe fail safe fail op are very very good buzz words
but unless you really understand the impact of those they can actually make a system less safe
i can make a very good case that a two engine airplane is safer than a four engine airplane simply by the way that you set your requirements
faa has a requirement that an airplane has to take off with one engine out
if you've got a two engine airplane then most of the time you've got one hundred percents more power than you need
if you have a four engine airplane you only have twenty five percents more power than you need
most airplane crashes are caused from lack of power at the right time
if you've got the power when you need it then you can get out of most bad situations
our original requirements on the shuttle after we got that started was to keep the operations cost low
we wanted to keep the maintenance cost and the operations cost low
we initially were looking at oxygen hydrogen systems
in fact all of the early orbiters had the hydrogen oxygen onboard
in place of their payload we had hydrogen tanks and oxygen tanks in there and carried the hydrogen oxygen onboard
and we actually looked at using the hydrogen out of those tanks
you get it free to power the oms and the rcs
and we looked at all kinds of ways of getting the pressure up high enough to be able to use the residuals to power the vehicle
one of the students asked the question the other day and we didn't give a very good answer that we did at one time look at putting the hydrogen in the payload bay of the shuttle
all of the very early configurations of the shuttle had the hydrogen and the oxygen in the shuttle in place of payload bay
that was the very early configuration
later on as dod got involved and other people wanted big spaces and carrying greyhound buses up there and things like that we had to use that space and that's when we came up with the external tank
and that's when we came up with a side by side configuration on it
that's the way i recall it
but we looked at oxygen hydrogen
then we went to methane because we were looking at bulk densities so that we had smaller tanks smaller volumes
then we looked at oxygen alcohol
and i really thought we had a good system with oxygen alcohol
i had a lot of confidence in that system
we used it on redstone
my first job was working on redstone
i really liked alcohol
i thought we had developed a good ignition system for the rcs so we didn't have to worry about the thousand starts
but obviously that was going to cost us money and cost a lot of development money
and as time went on we changed from having low operational cost to low development cost
and when we went to low development cost then we went to bipropellant on the oms and initially to monopropellant on the rcs
when i say bipropellant what i mean are storables monomethyl hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide
both are storable propellants
they are self igniting so you don't have to have an ignition system for it
that simplifies the design a whole lot
we had a lot of experience with those propellants on titan ii on agena and on apollo all of the apollo stages used either aerozine fifty and nitrogen tetroxide or monomethyl hydrogen
so we went to that
on the rcs we initially went to hydrazine as a monopropellant because it was the simplest system the cheapest system but very quickly the weight got out of hand and we had to go to something that had a little bit more performance than a hydrazine because all of that weight was in the backend of the vehicle
and the backend of the vehicle was getting too heavy
if you only remember two things out of this exercise and what i have to say today two things i want you to remember is that it is just not natural to think in terms of the absence of gravity and it is not natural to think in terms of the absence of pressure
when you think about it you live in it around here on the ground it is so natural that it's hard to think in terms of designing systems and the impact that the absence of gravity has or the absence of pressure has on the design of the systems
the other thing i would like for you to remember is that there is no substitute for a good well thought out test program
let me give you the oms as an example
we did not have a vibration test program on the propulsion systems on the oms or the rcs in the program because by that time we had good structural programs we could analyze the effect of vibration and stress on the vehicle
but we had a good propulsion test program and we built an oms pod just like the ones we had on the vehicle for qualification
and when we got through with all the propulsion tests on it and we went through that program in a breeze we had no problems at all with it so we finished it early
we took that pod down to jsc we put it in a vibro acoustic facility and while we were running the qvvt the low level vibration test on that pod just to get the response of how things responded to everything the helium bottle fell out
five minutes after that helium bottle fell out every structural guy in the world could tell you it should have fell out it would fall out but nobody thought about it in advance
what happened we had taken a high pressure helium line coming out of the bottom of the tank and going five feet or eight feet over to the structure and bolting it to the structure over there
now when you started shaking it that was acting as a torquing element on that tank and torquing that tank this way
and the struts they had coming down holding the tank it was fatiguing where they were put onto the tank
it fatigued them right in there and broke them off very quick but we didn't pick it up
the oms was very very straightforward from a development standpoint
we came out with a platelet injector that gave us very good combustion
you have to explain what a platelet injector is
ok
a platelet injector is one where we used photographic techniques to etch holes in the injector
you could get a very very fine pattern
you made it in very thin sheets and you coated the sheet with a coating where you could put them in a press and heat them and glue them together
you came up with an injector design that was made out of many many thousands of very thin plates that set up the manifolding on it
normal injectors you have to do a lot of very integrated drilling
normal injectors you drill out a manifold in the back and then you take the face plate and you have to drill holes in it
and the problem we get into when you start doing that is with these very small drills they tend to walk or bend
and you don't get a straight hole
you don't get a good spray pattern
with a platelet injector we could get a very close match
we could just kind of dribble a field in there and oxidizer in there where it always matched real well
we got very high performance out of it
we're talking about the injector up here where you have the fuel and oxygen and then you have to have a whole bunch of holes in a pattern such that the fuel and the oxidizer are properly mixed when they ignite inside
you need to get the oxidizer to impinge on a fuel very precisely so that with an aero storable propellant a hypergolic propellant as we call it that is self igniting
and basically what you have is when the two fuels come together it is like having a very strong acid and a very strong base coming together
the first reaction that you get is a heating reaction
that chemical reaction that you get will take the propellant temperature up to eight hundred point one thousand one thousand two hundred degrees
anyway it gets it up to the combustion temperature and then you start the combustion process
so you don't have to use any other ignition source
all you do is bring those two propellants together and you get that chemical reaction that provides the energy the heat to heat the propellant to the combustion temperature
like all high performance rocket engines we had a stability problem with the oms
and we had to put big acoustic cavities thirty eight percents of the injector on the oms was cavities designed and sized to damp out the stability so we had a very good stable engine
the rcs on the other hand is a totally different design
now we put the propellant tanks on the rcs up in front of the oms tanks for aerodynamic purposes
that gave us a thirty foot propellant line down to the rcs
then we would manifold three four five engines on the end of that pipe that is pulsing in and out of phase or steady state
some of them were running at forty millisecond or eighty millisecond pulses
some of them might be running at four times that on a pulse width
and some of them may be running at steady state
anyway the dynamics the pressure in that line that the engine sees varies somewhere between vapor pressure and about one thousand psi
and since one propellant is one point six times the density of the other propellant when that valve opens down there that pressure wave has got to go back up to the tank and come back down to the injector before you get basically any flow out of it
just the compressibility that you have in the pipe will come out
the pressure essentially drops to vapor pressure
and we use helium to pressurize those tanks
when we use helium to pressurize those tanks the helium is dissolved in the propellant
when it gets down to the engine it comes out as solution
the engine has to be able to stay together at any mixture ratio and almost any pressure
and you are looking at hundreds of thousands of starts over the life of one of those programs on one of those engines
and we talk about pulse width
pulse width is the minimum ohm time that you can have on a rocket engine
now there is a volume between the face of the valve and the face of the injector that we call dribble volume
the larger that volume is the larger the pulse width you need on it
you would like to have the seat of the valve to be the face of the injector so you have zero dribble volume in there
that way you would get closer to a square wave pulse
and your friends in guidance control they always want to square away pulse
and they want it to have an infinite thrust level and zero width so that you put an instantaneous pulse
it makes it easier for them to calculate where the vehicle is going to go than if you get one that builds up kind of slow and goes down kind of slow
the dribble volume the volume that you have between the valve seat and the injector phase when the engine shuts down when the valve closes that flow stops and that amount of propellant stays in there
now in a vacuum when it gets down to the vapor pressure starts boiling out and goes out through the chamber
and you have a refrigeration effect from that boiling of the propellant
if the pulse width is too short then the refrigeration effect will overcome the heating effect from that short pulse and you keep reducing the temperature of the hardware
the colder the propellant gets the more heat you have to put in the chemical reaction when it first comes together to get it to ignite
you get an ignition delay in the thing and then you start getting into hard starts if it gets too cold
so we set our pulse width on the shuttle at forty milliseconds
that was the neutral point at which the refrigeration effect equaled the heating effect from the pulse and so you would maintain the temperature
we later on went to eighty milliseconds on it because we added the veniers
that gave us a little bit of heat input
it's a pretty tough design in itself
the valve that we used for a one thousand pound rocket on the orbiter weighed less than the valves that we used on the apollo program for one hundred pound thruster
and what we did is we went to a pilot operated valve
that was kind of my concept that i borrowed from sears roebuck
if you ever take a washing machine apart on a sears roebuck and you look at how the valve is designed it is a pilot operated valve
and they use the water pressure to open the valve
well i thought that was good way to go
you put a very small coil in there a quick acting coil and replace that rubber bellows that used on a sears roebuck washing machine with a stainless steel diaphragm and you've got it made
well unfortunately the water pressure in a house doesn't vary as much as the water hammer does on the space shuttle
so before we got through with the design of that valve it got to be a very complex valve
and it was a very expensive valve but it worked
probably the other thing we ought to say about designing any system that is going to work with these hypergolic fuels i mean they just eat away at things like o ring seals
i mean it's just nasty stuff
and so in addition to the mechanical problems that henry is talking about you've got all the materials problems which just makes your life harder
we really wanted to stay away from hypergols from the very strong acids and the very strong bases for the simple reason that there are very few materials that are compatible with them
as a matter of fact the main reason we went to a hydrazine rcs in the beginning was to avoid having an expulsion system in the oxidizer because we had no material available that you could put in there as a diaphragm to push the propellants out that was compatible with n two point four that you could make cycles with
we could have used metal bellows but they weren't very reliable
they were extremely heavy
and so we had to come up with a better system than that
and then we kind of got to looking into putting in screens in the system
and that was really a hard sell
i mean i spent lots of time with aaron
i was convinced that system would work because if you look at an automobile gas tank every fuel tank on every automobile has got a sock in it
that sock is about an inch and a half in diameter and it will suck every drop of fuel out of that gas tank
they putit in a little sump in there and it will just draw that tank dry before it will break down and let air go through it
i was convinced that we could build one of those systems and make it work
but if you look at an automobile you know it goes over rough roads it bounces you've got g fields you've got all kinds of forces on that thing and yet it works very good
the problem we had in trying to sell that concept to the program though was how do you prove it
the only technique we had to prove it was through analysis
and you're trying to prove that something like that will work purely from analysis
and qualified by analysis was a hard hard sell
we later on in a program came up with techniques where we could wrap tape around most of the screens in there so that we close up most of the area
and so we would draw a propellant in in very small areas with aerospaces on top and prove that you could get down to a certain delta p and cross it before it would break down to qualify our analysis
we still were not satisfied with that so we made up a system with a glass tank we put it on our vomit comet and flew it
and that was the only time where i ever road that thing
if we had made one more time it would have been all over for me
but you get up thirty eight thousand feet and you make a dive on that thing
and you can maintain zero g in it through that thirty second or thirty eight second period of time
and by expelling the right amount at the right levels we could prove that it would work
and it has worked very very well on all the flights
in the future design of the spacecraft what is going to be the difference in the rcs system
because every system is going to have to have some kind of reaction control system
what do you think they are going to go with in the future systems
i really believe that we ought to go with either methane and lox or alcohol and lox
i think it's a much cleaner system
we developed that little piece of electric igniter for the shuttle program
we never used it after we went away from those systems
but you buy these little latch torches now that you push a button and pull a trigger on it
and they light off most of the time although the last one i got didn't light too well
but we have good reliable ignition systems now
and i think that you can design a system now that has the reliability that you need for a space system
otherwise we've done nothing in this country since the shuttle program on developing
the things you have got to remember is that the thermal characteristics are very very different in a vacuum than it is on earth
it is very different in the absence of gravity
you wouldn't think gravity would make any difference in it but it does
you've got some fluid in the tank
you put some heat on the bottom of the tank
where does heat go
it goes to the top of the tank
the top of the tank is always the hottest part
when you've got a liquid in one g you put it in zero g you put heat on the bottom of the tank a bubble forms down there it pushes the liquid away from it and nothing comes out of the tank
let me have some questions
i'm slightly confused on the fuel that the system uses
both rcs and the oms use hydrazine or hypergolic
i'm confused
hydrazine is n two point four
we use that as a monopropellant
a bipropellant earth storable
a monopropellant system you normally run it over a catalytic bed and it decomposes
yes
there are two monopropellants out there that work very good
one is hydrogen peroxide
and if you can get it above ninety percents it gets a little more stable
and the other one is hydrazine
both of those you run through a catalyst
when it hits a catalyst you get the reaction out of it and it breaks down
the hydrogen peroxide breaks down to steam and oxygen and hydrazine breaks down to hydrogen and ammonia nh three
but both of those give you hot gases then for propulsion
you mix that with an acid and you get combustion
and we used aerozine fifty which i mentioned
aerozine fifty was fifty percents hydrazine and fifty percents unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine
monomethylhydrazine is just that monomethylhydrazine
it is a lot more stable than is hydrazine
it has a wider freezing boiling point than hydrazine
hydrazine has a lot of the characteristics of water as far as density freezing and boiling
it will freeze at about the same temperature as water it will boil at about the same temperature as water and it has almost the same density as water
monomethylhydrazine has a little bit slightly less density it gives you a slightly better performance but it freezes at like minus sixty three degrees or something like that
monomethylhydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide
the same thing for the oms
now one of the things we do is we put about four tenths of a percent of nitric oxide in the nitrogen tetroxide to keep the tanks from breaking
we have titanium tanks
and on the apollo program we got into a very serious problem because a tank started exploding
it turned out with aerozine fifty or monopropellant hydrazine we had a little bit of water in there and that gave off a little bit of free hydrogen
and that free hydrogen titanium just does not like hydrogen
how many people have taken fraction mechanics
well fraction mechanics really started from that
that's when we started working with a gentleman called doctor tiffany at boeing
we worked with the whole world on that problem
that's how fraction mechanics really got started
you were going to ask something
while we're talking about fractions one of the other problems of dealing with these hypergolic fuels is the freezing problem
maybe we will talk a little bit about that
because unlike water when the hydrazine freezes it shrinks
and so if you imagine that you've got hydrazine liquid in a line under pressure and now it gets too cold so it freezes
and now that leaves a little bit of free volume so you get more liquid that comes in there and that will freeze
until finally the entire line is clogged up with solid hydrazine
now when it warms up it expands and you crack the line
and now you've got a hypergolic leak which is really bad news
so in fact maintaining thermal control of the oms and rcs propellant lines becomes a very critical issue
and there are heating coils all over the place and thermostats
and so again you don't just have a propulsion system in the systems engineering that we talked about
it affects the thermal the electrical system because all these things are inner related
if you lose an electrical system so that you cannot run the heaters then you run the risk of losing your propellant system
and so then you have to have redundant heaters and so on
and it gets more and more complicated
that was a major major problem we had on apollo thirteen
we didn't have enough power
we had to turn everything off quick
and trying to get those people to let that temperature go down out of limits was not easy
and i remember sitting down and spending an entire night running out the thermal calculations and calculating out when we could turn the heaters off or we could keep the service module off of that vehicle and not freeze the propellant and the rcs on the command module
and then i got really really worried
i gave myself four degrees above freezing on that system and i missed it two degrees
it got two degrees colder than we had planned
the design of the rcs system was very very complicated
how many rcs specialists do we have on the shuttle forty
thirty eight primary and four vernier
and so it's a very complicated system in designing it
it had a lot of requirements placed on it
on the other hand the oms engine as i recall we have never had a failure on the oms engine
the oms engine has been very very successful
it is a very straightforward program
by getting the combustion close to the injector on the oms then we could make the chamber small on the oms
and by making the chamber very small on the oms then you could cool it
you could put cooling channels down the chamber and run the fuel down there and keep the chamber cool so it wouldn't burn out
now we also did the same thing on the rcs a little bit different
the rcs is a buried installation
we have to run that engine for five hundred seconds or more if we want to use it for de orbit in case the oms plays out sometimes
that engine has to stay together on these very very short burns
it also has to stay together on these very very long burns with fluctuating inlet pressures and fluctuating mixture ratios
we found that if we make a very very short chamber and that's why when you look at the rcs it is a big chamber it is very short
we could put enough fuel down the walls of that chamber to effectively cool the chamber so it would only go up steady states to a certain safe temperature and still have good performance out of it
so we put a lot of fuel down the walls on it
looking in this direction if this is the injector plate the holes around the outer most layer those are all fuel
so you basically get a fuel bath coming along that actually comes in contact
and if you have a fuel rich mixture the same as in a car the fuel mixture burns cooler
the thing that you're really afraid of in fact you have to deal with a lot of contingencies on this system what happens if you get a clog in one of your feed lines
the worst situation you can get in is that you get a clog in your fuel inlet line and that gives you an oxidizer rich mixture which burns hot
and you can then actually get a melt through
and so you've got to shut your engine down in a hurry if that happens
these are very very small orifices and a lot of them around the outside of it
and if you get a couple of these orifices plugged then that becomes a hot spot on the side of the chamber
and we used columbium which has very poor heat transfer
we used molybdenum on apollo which has good heat transfer
to return to your point about the possibility of using the rcs as a backup for reentry
what prevents one from using a series of relatively short burns of the orbiter to smooth out the velocity chain
why do you have to have a single file of second burn
before you start to burn to come back in how much time you can put in between those and how short a one thousand pound thruster for deorbit takes a fairly long burn
and the engine goes to steady state fairly quick you know in a matter of twenty seconds
we ran rcs engines for the shuttle up to an hour and a half on a single burn
even though you put it in multiple burns you still have to have fairly long pulse widths on each one of them
and that impacts the guidance very very badly
let me help with a little orbital mechanics
we talked about this before
you're in orbit
when you do a burn you can do a retrograde burn which lowers the other side of your orbit so that now becomes the perigee
the thing is from orbital mechanics the most efficient way to do a burn is to have like henry said an infinite thrust with a zero pulse width
you do what they call an impulsive burn
but in the real world that never happens
now it is forty five minutes from here to here it's a ninety minute orbit
now when you have two oms engines a typical deorbit burn lasts two to two and a half minutes
you're burning over this segment
it's pretty close to an impulsive burn
you lose one oms engine and now you have to double it
now you're up to a five minute burn
but if you lose your second oms engine and now you have to do an rcs deorbit now you're getting into a ten point fifteen minute burn
and so you're actually really far away from optimum
and the burn gets much less efficient
and so if you have plenty of propellant you're fine but if you're low on propellant you need to worry about the efficiency of your burn
if you were to do a little bit of a burn and then shut it down to let your engines cool off and then you try to complete the burn around here now it has gotten really really inefficient and you might run out of propellant
we spent an enormous amount of time with our orbital mechanics people and our guidance people trying to get the oms strut down as low as we could get it
because the lower you can get it the smaller the hardware the lighter the weight of the hardware and the performance is essentially the same
the isp for a three thousand pound engine is essentially the same as it is for a twenty thousand or maybe even a little bit higher for three point zero
we had five thousand pound thrust in there
we had four thousand pound thrust in there
i think we finally wound up with three point five hundred
been left up to me i think we could have done it with a one thousand five hundred pound thrust engine
but we compromised
yes
professor cohen once mentioned that some people suggested putting some rcs thrusters on the edge of the wing tips but that would be very difficult after the design was finalized
all of our early configurations that we had we had the rcs pods out on the wing tips
it made the rcs very efficient
our rcs was the oms at one time and we had it all out on the wing tips
it didn't make our structures friends too happy at first because that puts a lot of mass out into the wings and they didn't like it too much but after they got looking at it that turned out that really wasn't much of a driver
it made the rcs very efficient
the thing that kind of changed that is when we put the big payload bay on the inside of the vehicle and then we had to put a big oms pod on there
and then to put the rcs pods out on a wing tip of a delta system out there just didn't weigh out good
it was more efficient from a weight standpoint to put the oms and rcs together because we actually had those two interconnected
if we have to do an oms burn with the rcs we can take the propellant out of the oms tank to feed the rcs
and so it just made a more efficient system to bring it all in
we had another requirement
when we went to the acid based propellants we had a requirement that we had to have removable pods
you had to be able to take the propulsion system off of the orbiter and take it over to another facility to rework it because we knew we were going to have a lot of work and rework on those systems at least early on
you had a question right here
to what extent can you change orbits due to a higher or lower orbit
that is very limited but we do have the capability to go up and down in orbit
i don't know maybe fifty miles
i don't know
i don't have a good answer
i don't remember that
that has been too long ago
with a full load you have a few hundred feet per second i would have to go and look up you cannot make the plane change
no plane changes are out
but we certainly have gone from let's see like one hundred eighty nautical mile orbits down to a one hundred five mile
i remember one flight where we did that
to go up you know what you really want to do is of course use your main propulsion system to get into the right orbit that you want to go to
then if you're going to do a rendezvous you have to change the height a little bit
but you typically try to get orbit insertion within about twenty nautical miles so about forty kilometers radius of your ultimate intended orbit
for some special missions like i was on one mission where we were up at about one hundred eighty nautical miles doing various operations but then the last couple of days they wanted to look at the interaction of the orbiter with the atomic oxygen and nitrogen which causes this orbiter glow phenomena which maybe some of you have heard about
we had to go down to about one hundred five nautical miles which is about as low as you can go and stay in orbit for more than a day or so
and so yeah that was ok because that was just you're doing part of your deorbit burn but then you stop
what you wouldn't want to do is go to a one hundred five mile orbit and then go up and then you would have to come all the way down again
i think we will take one more question and go to break
it is awfully easy to decrease the orbit because you're using part of the energy that you have to use to come back home anyway
when you start trying to go up is when you're adding
but we have a lot of contingency propellant onboard
we've got contingent propellant in case the main engines shut off early
then you have to use the rcs
if you've got a docking mission we've got propellant in there for three or four attempts at docking and things like that
there is extra propellant that you can use to give you a little bit of a boost
you had a question here
going back to the comment that was made about the and presenting a hazard that way what kind of feedback did the crew have when something like that was happening
were there sensors in that system
i don't hear too well
the question is what sort of sensors do we have for the operation of the engines
there are pressure sensors
there are temperature sensors
again remember when we were talking earlier though sensors don't always tell the truth
sometimes you can get sensor failures
and so we spent a lot of time practicing
and you work out all the different scenarios
this is what you will see if you have a real failure
this is what you will see if you have a sensor failure
and before you shut down a good working engine you would like to confirm the fact that it is really an engine problem not a sensor problem
on the other hand you don't want to take a chance that you're going to get into an oxidizer rich situation and blow up your engine
you practice and after a while get pretty good at diagnosing the problems fairly quickly
the computer doesn't normally shut down the oms engine on its own
the computer will not shut down any of the propulsion systems on its own
it will shut down the main engine but none of these will it shut down on its own
somebody has got to take some action to shut it down
we get an awful lot of data on the ground too that you don't have in the cockpit that you can look at different instruments and backup things and try to understand where there is a sensor failure
any other questions on oms rcs
during entry when you're coming down using the rcs for like trajectory guidance before your aerosurfaces are usable how much propellant would you typically use
is there like a certain percentage that would be average
that's a pretty low percentage and i don't recall
that has been a long time now and i don't recall the numbers
but i would say it's less than ten percents of the propellant
what did you say
about ten percents
well at least that ought to be a pretty good number
it's not a lot of propellant come back in on it
the vehicle is a fairly stable vehicle
now on columbia i guess they either ran out of propellant or just about ran out of propellant on it trying to hold it
rcs was doing all it could to try to hold that vehicle on course after it started picking up drag on one side
and we actually did have procedures in place for what we called a no rcs entry if you had run out of propellant entirely
i don't know if it would have worked
you tried to get it into a stable aerodynamic situation as possible and just hold it there
i never had to actually do it
anymore oms rcs questions
otherwise why don't we take a little break and then we will come back for apu hydraulics
two minute break
thank you all
appreciate it
you're not finished
apu hydraulics
and i guess i need to point out some acronyms
calling the apu an apu was the biggest mistake we ever made
that gave me more grief than any other system that i had to deal with the acronym
apu stands for auxiliary power unit
and the aerospace safety advisory committee i will tell you henry my kids growing up used to think it was a three letter bad word
i mean they thought apu was a bad word
because every time i got a call there was something wrong with it
if we would have called it primary power unit then we would have had a lot less grief in trying to defend it to the outside world
apu hydraulics like the oms and rcs all of our first activity was directed toward keeping the operational cost down low keeping the maintenance cost down low
and we looked at those kinds of systems that gave you clean propellants easy propellants to deal with and you didn't have to worry about the strong bases and strong acids to work with
later on as time went on we got more into looking at what we could do cheap from a development standpoint and let the operational cost float because it is obvious that the money was not going to be there to put into a big development program
the control of the vehicle in the atmosphere was a major major activity to try to find out what you could get by with versus what you would like to have
you try to move these huge barn doors fast and a whole lot there are huge forces on those things
it takes lots and lots of power to move them and move them quick
and our aero people and our guidance people would like to have like we were talking a while ago an instantaneous impulse into that vehicle
when it starts to drift a little bit and they want to move it some other way they like to put an impulse in there and just kick it right back where it is supposed to be instantly
but that becomes impractical when you look at these kinds of systems
we started out with dual tandem actuators
now dual tandem actuators is something that fail op fail safe criteria
in other words you had two pistons and one actuator driven by two different hydraulic systems and you would move them together
when you start looking at all of the failure modes associated with dual tandem actuators
even though it meets the fail op fail safe criteria that makes the safety people happy and the people that are looking at the buzz words it actually was making the system less safe
was that because you had a single passenger all the hydraulic fluid
no
what happened in a dual tandem actuator in order to get them to work well if you busted an actuator then that became a big sponge
you didn't have any way to take that space out
trying to have that actuator work when the other half went out made it very very difficult from a design standpoint to come up with a system that you could lock it in place
and we even had designs where if one hydraulic system failed that that shaft would actually lock itself
with the absence of pressure it would lock itself
well that becomes a failure in itself because if that mechanism fails then you've got a locked actuator
one thing you cannot stand on an aeroplane is for an actuator not to move
we were finally able to convince the people
and aaron was having lots and lots problems about that time because all of the weight was in the backend of the vehicle
the dual tandem actuators were extremely heavy and the backend of the vehicle was getting too heavy so we actually went to a single actuator
and we put switching valves in there where we could switch any one of the four apu systems into that actuator
and we had four apus at that time
weight was still a problem so we were able to convince the community that we could live with three apus and have one apu fail and come home normal mode with two
and if you had two failures you could still land the vehicle with one actuator
you lost a whole bunch of systems but you could still land it with one apu
and we almost did that one time because if someone would have told me that we would ever have two failures of the same type on the same flight of the nature that we had i would have never believed it
but we came home on one flight with two apus burning
we had a fire in both of the apus
and the reason for that after the fact again is very very simple
we went through a very good quality program
we did everything that we needed to on those things only to find out that we had not planned on landing the vehicle in california and piggy backing it back down to the cape over and over again
what happens when you do that is that you land the vehicle there is a little bit of residual apu hydrazine in those tubes between the valves and the injector
you go back up into a vacuum or low pressure
all the air goes out of the system
and then we come and land in florida
it is always humid in florida
there is a lot of moisture there
and as that moist air started feeding back in the engine it went up past the bed and got in those tubes between the valve and the injector and set up a very very corrosive environment of residual hydrazine and water
and that gave off free hydrogen
and you had hydrogen or intergranular corrosion in those tubes
and we had two of them break on the same flight but it worked
we spent an awful lot of time looking at power sources to power the hydraulic systems
and we even looked at going with all electrical systems
dod had some very good fuel cells out there that had a lot of promise
it put an awful lot of power at that time
let me just digress a little bit and talk about shuttle fuel cells
i don't think anybody can cover that
on gemini the fuel cells never did work
we always came back with half voltage or partial voltage and most of the fuel cells out
on apollo it only took fourteen phds to start them and shut them down
and then you couldn't start them again
on the space shuttle those fuel cells it is just a very very good battery with the chemicals stored external to the battery
they would make an outstanding dc welder
i mean you could put electrodes in that thing and put an electrical rod in there and strike and arc and weld with them and break the arc strike and arc and weld and break the arc
and they just do it repeatedly
you can throw a switch they are on you throw a switch and they are off
and so they are very very simple
i really really wanted us to go with an all electrical system using electrical motors and power hinges and electrical mechanical actuators to drive the systems because i was absolutely convinced that one of these days we were going to have a leak in the hydraulic system
and when we have a leak in the hydraulic system we are going to have a fire
all airplanes have hydraulic leaks
now you don't have to worry too much about hydraulic leaks on an airplane
you have enough pressure where you seldom have to worry about a fire
we went from five thousand six hundred six hydraulic fluid to eighty three thousand two hundred eighty two hydraulic fluid simply because it was advertised as being more flame resistant
it is really not more flame resistant
the eighty three thousand two hundred eighty two hydraulic fluid has a much much lower vapor pressure than does five thousand six hundred six
and a way that they test it is they have got a bunsen burner out here
they take a pipe cleaner and dip it in the fluid clamp it in this device that rotates past that bunsen burner and they count the number of times it will go across it before the fire starts
well with five thousand six hundred six it will usually start on a third burn
with eighty three thousand two hundred eighty two it takes ten point eleven twelve passes before it will ignite and start burning simply because it has a lower vapor pressure and you cannot burn any liquid in a liquid stage
you have to get it warm enough so that it will gasify
and then you have to heat it enough in a gas phase to get it up to the combustion temperature or put a spark in it after it is in the gas phase
but it won't ignite as a liquid
well with six thousand five hundred six if you have a leak in the hydraulic system going uphill you probably don't have to worry about it coming home because it's gone
it all boils off and is gone
with eighty three thousand two hundred eighty two all it does is soak out into the structure and in the insulation and all over the place
and then when you come back home if it gets in a hot spot and you start heating it up it forms a gas and you're going to get an explosion in the back of the vehicle
so that was a bad decision aaron
we went in a bad direction but it gave everybody a warm feeling
we would have went with an electric mechanical system but by that time we had a lot of hydraulic people working on the program
and we would lay those people all off and we had our whole bunch of electrical mechanical people and a lot of people were concerned about the immaturity of those systems
and again it boiled down to development cost
did we really have the energy source that could handle that
oh i'm convinced that we could have put six or eight of those fuel cells that we've got on there right now and could have handled it
broke it down
and the fuel cells that dod had under development at that time were very very good fuel cells
if i was upgrading the shuttle today that is one of the things that i absolutely would go to
i would go to something to get rid of the hydraulic fluid
it creates a lot of other kinds of problems that you have to deal with
actually before the decision was made that the shuttle was going to be retired in five years nasa was working on upgrades if we were going to fly the shuttle for another twenty or twenty five years
and one of the upgrades which actually got to a fairly advanced stage in the design was just what you were saying
get rid of the apu hydraulics use the latest technology now available for electromechanical actuators
but the problem i don't know the details of it but the costs just kept going up and up and up
and by the time it went up above about dollars three hundred million they just said we cannot afford to do this
the problem we always had in trying to upgrade the propulsion we could have gone to an alcohol lox space rcs oms on it
we could have upgraded to an electromechanical system but it seemed to me like that the displays and those kinds of upgrades took a lot of computers
those systems took a lot of priority in where the monies went in trying to upgrade the orbiter
we did go from four to three systems
we did go from four apus to three apus and still having the ability to land the vehicle with one apu
we look at hydrogen oxygen apus
we looked at bipropellant apus
we looked at monopropellant apus
we looked at pulse modulated versus pressure modulated
if you don't know what i mean by that pulse modulated is when you have a valve that goes open and closed and you get steady state pressure in your gas generator while it is on
pressure modulated you have a throttle valve where you throttle the flow down going to the gas generator to give you just the power that you need for the load that you are trying to pull at the time
and that was the easiest system to come up with simply because we did not know at the time if we could build a valve that was capable of millions and millions of cycles and not a leak
but the problem with a pressure modulated system was that most of the time you're operating at very very low power levels
the power just peaks up every once in a while to high power levels
but when you're running very low pressures in a gas turbine the turbine becomes less efficient
and the less efficient the turbine becomes the more propellant you have to burn and again the weight goes up
so we kind of bit the bullet on that and went to a pressure modulated system where we varied the ohm time
in valve development we were very successful
we had very little trouble getting a valve that would work except for contamination
we always had a little contamination
we had a lot of problems down the cape with early valves leaking
we finally put good filters in the system and that eliminated that
yes
was the reason to go from four to three apus just a weight issue
it's again a weight issue
all of that weight was in the back of the vehicle and the back of the vehicle was always too heavy
and every time we could take a pound out of the back of the vehicle we could take a pound of ballast out of the front of the vehicle so there were two pounds you didn't have to carry
so it was strictly weight
i'm sorry the apus are turbines
i mean you're combusting
the apus we settled on was going with a monopropellant hydrazine feed that through a catalyst bed and then through a turbine
we looked at dual stage triple stage turbines
we finally wound up with a single stage turbine running at about thirty eight thousand to forty five point zero i don't remember the exact number now rpm
about ten inches in diameter
the gas went in and then made a pass and went back through so we got maybe five percents ten percents more power out of it the second time through a little bit more power out of it the second time through
when we contracted for the apu the contractor did not have altitude facilities
and so they proposed that we did not need to test the apu in a vacuum because that was all structure and all they had to do was pull a vacuum on the exhaust and could get the performance out of that
so we did not have it in our quality program to test the apu in a vacuum
fortunately doctor cohen gave us enough money to buy an apu offline of the shuttle program
we brought it down to jsc
we put it in our vacuum facilities there
and we programmed the vacuum facility to go down in pressure
the orbiter was going up in altitude
and we ran the ascent profile and shut the apu off just like we would on a first flight
and five minutes after we shut it off it exploded it detonated
i mean talk about things coming unglued
everything came unglued
aaron came unglued
we got another apu
we brought it down there
we brought all of the contractor people down everybody down there
we repeated the test
it exploded again
by that time we discovered what the problem was
we have a requirement in the program that you can only have hot surfaces up to about five hundred degrees
i don't remember the exact temperature but some temperature like five hundred degrees
if it is higher than that you have to shield it
the gas generator is obviously running over five hundred degrees probably up around eight hundred point nine hundred degrees so we put a heat shield around it
we covered that whole thing up and had about a half inch standoff in the insulation on that thing
when you run it in one atmosphere if you shut it off it acts like a chimney
the air heats up between the insulation and the hot surface and goes out the top
it draws cold air in
it goes out the top
it draws more cold air in so it cools it off
so the heat never did soak out into the valves and get the valves too hot
when you put it in a vacuum there is no place for that heat to go
and so all of that heat that was in the gas generator and all of the catalyst and all of that soaked back out through the structure and through the tubes back up to the valves and got the valves up to the temperature at which hydrazine will detonate
and it did
it is so simple
it is so easy to understand after you know about it
but to think about it i remember sitting around there one night to eight point zero nine point zero with all of my troops discussing the pros and cons of an altitude facility
do we have to have it
do we have to direct the contractor to put one in
and we could not come up with a good reason to put an altitude test in the program so we didn't put it in there
fortunately just like on ohms with the helium bottle falling out we had a backup because some of the people weren't confident in flying the vehicle without that test
and we found something that we didn't expect
the message that henry is giving you on testing is the same message that j_r
thompson gave you on testing on the main engine
and in contrast we didn't really do that type of testing on the solid rocket booster the fair we had and on the foam
and that is the difference we really tested
when we saw a problem we tested it
and we came out very fortunate but we did do it
another thing with the development of the apu we flew those things on airplanes all the time in case they lost main engine our fighter aircraft and then some of the other airplanes including that supersonic plane that we had
it had apus in there in case they lost engine power to provide hydraulics to be able to land the vehicle
and that got a lot of the flack because the aerospace safety committee told me that those systems never did work because they're called auxiliary power units
they never worked when you needed them
but they had those systems
and they were good systems
but when we tried to use that same kind of design on the shuttle the oil wouldn't go back to the sump in the absence of gravity
you sling it out and it just coats the walls on an automobile
you put an oil pan down the bottom you put a pump right at the bottom you put a little filter in there and pump the oil out and pump it through the engine and use it over and over and over
but when you have no bottom you have no place for that oil to go
so we had to come up with a technique where we could use the gears as oil pumps
and we came up with very very close tolerances between the gear and the case and let the gear sling the oil out or pump the oil out into a cavity and pipe it off to where we had a sump to where we could pick oil up with an oil pump and pump it back through the system
and we had some problems with some hydrazine getting in there and gelling it one time
and fram came out with this deal where you could pay me now or you can pay me later kind of thing because they still aren't changing the oil filter
hydraulics was mostly off the shelf at the time the pump and that stuff
we did go to titanium propellant lines or hydraulic lines
we did develop a special fitting to put titanium lines together
it turned out to be very very good
we did have to add a water boiler to cool the hydraulic fluid because on airplanes just put a little radiator in there and use the atmosphere to cool it but that didn't work in space
the first one they came up with was a bucket and it had a core of tubes in that bucket with a pipe that went out with some baffles in there to keep the liquid from going out
but there again they did not understand the absence of gravity
when in zero g and you put heat in that water it just pushes the water out away from the tube
and all the water would go out the exhaust pipe and you would have nothing but gas in the tank
we had to change that design and go into what we call a water spray barge
to pulse the water in there as a spray is more efficient
but complicated that system very much
it still does
it is very very difficult to handle water in a vacuum
getting back to the rcs one moment the first rain we had down there at the cape the rcs jets filled up with water
and they wanted to launch that system assuming that the water would boil out when they started going uphill
but no what happens is when you put water in a vacuum about sixty percents of it will go to a gas and thirty percents will freeze
when it freezes then it is a solid you cannot get it out it just has to sublime which takes weeks and months
now trying to get us a water boiler we had valves in there that were supposed to open and close when the pressure built up
well when you get past that valve when that valve would open up that steam would instantly freeze on the outside and it keeps growing back
finally the valve would be stopped up and you would build the pressure up way high and would blow the ice out
the pressure would come back down and start working again
so we went to an orifice
trying to size that orifice to the right size where it maintains a little pressure in there and you've got a variable load on the system and you're putting variable energy into it that's difficult to design that too
the water boiler still freezes
we still have a freezing problem on it
it is not an easy solution to it
questions
do you lose that water
yeah we just dump it overboard
we have a whole bunch of tubes going through this water and we spray the water in in a spray
and it makes one pass through those tubes and then it goes out the exhaust
if you wanted to come up with some kind of regenerative system where you would use the water over and over and over then you've got to go through some kind of system to cool the water or you have to carry too much water aboard
well if you want to cool the water the only way you really have got to cool it is by using more water or supplementing some of that water
in a vacuum you cannot just put it out on a surface some place
i guess the temperature varies maybe
henry could you say a word about the flight control hydraulics lab the tests we ran with the hydraulic systems
the hydraulic system was probably one of the most thoroughly tested systems that we had as far as mechanical systems were concerned
we built a whole hydraulic system integrated with the avionics and we had it designed so you could put loads on it and react the loads
and you could program in what you thought was typical emissions where you could vary everything
the only difference is instead of driving the hydraulic pumps with apus we drove the hydraulic pumps with electric motors because we had ground based electric motors to drive them
and one of the things we ground ruled out was the use of flex hoses belts simply because they at that time were notorious for fatiguing and breaking and not working very good
so we put trombone tubes in
take a long tube and bring it back this way and tie it in
and now as the actuator moved it could move
and you had enough spring or enough give in those tubes
on the very first time they fired that thing up standing up in there in the control room looking at it those trombone tubes just vanished
they would be there and then all at once you wouldn't see them
and i mean you couldn't see them
you're standing up there in the control room looking and there are no tubes in there
they were shaking so bad that you couldn't see them
so we went through a big effort to figure out ways to damp those things and isolate them so that they didn't vibrate
we had a major failure
it was a hard hard sell to convince the people to go to a single actuary from a dual tandem single actuator
well no more than we got our first single actuator built the initial design had too much slack in a tube that went from one side to the other side because you had to have an expansion joint in there
and we had an o ring in there
and they had too much slack in there and it blew one of the o rings out
well of course when you blew an o ring out you lost all the hydraulics not only from that system but all three systems because it was downstream of the switching valves
and when one system ran out of fluid it would switch over to the other one and you would run out of fluid
had we not had a very very strong guy in the program office at that time that never gave up on anything that would have probably finished us off as far as single actuators are concerned
but we were able to convince the program that if we tightened the tolerance up on it paid very close attention to the tolerance on it that it could not happen
and it has not happened again
another question
yes
you talked a little bit before about maybe substituting an electromechanical system for hydraulic
would there be any other changes you would make in the design if you had to go back and do it again
oh if i had to do it again i definitely would go with electromechanical systems
now that takes on many varieties
you could have small electric motors driving a hydraulic system right at the unit
like you put an electric motor on an actuator
and that electric motor drives a small hydraulic pump that would move the actuator if you did not have confidence in worm gears and screw jacks and those kind of things to provide the mechanical force power hinges and things like that
but there is absolutely no question in my mind that one of the safest things you could do for the orbiter right now would be to replace the apus in the hydraulic system with an electrical system
we have the motor technology we have i think the gear and the ball screw technology to be able to do that
i think we could do it cheap
i think that would really change the operational cost
it would reduce the operational of cost immensely
it would move the cg further forward on the vehicle so you probably could take out a little bit more of the ballast that we usually fly on the front end
i guess we're still flying it
we always did
i have another question
you talked earlier and you had it on the slide but you didn't really talk about it how you were shifting weight between budgets when it came to like the controls people versus the hydraulics people and the apus
and i was wondering if you could kind of just expand on that of how in an actual development program it goes back and forth
i mean does it usually come down from high you're going to do this and you're going to do that or is it usually they let you kind of work it out between the groups or what
the control people have no weight budget
i mean their budget is the electrons that flow back and forth and the requirements
what they do is they start out a requirement that they would like to have
and it is usually two three four times what they absolutely have to have
and then you have to sit down and start negotiating with them and explaining to them what it is costing
and often it gets down to the fact that the vehicle won't fly
i mean it just flat won't fly
and when they are convinced then that it cannot fly then they are willing to concede that they can get by with a little more
and it still won't fly and so they can get by with a little bit more
and that's kind of the way you get it done
that's what you do
you have a work breakdown structure and you parcel that work breakdown structure out to your subsystem managers
now there was an issue in the shuttle and the apollo program since i was a project manager you give the subsystem managers the requirements and the authority technically
you tell them what their constraint is for dollars you give them the weight bogies or the weight requirements the function requirements performance requirements the schedule requirements but you keep the dollars
now that's been a very long argument
do you allow the subsystem managers to actually have control over the dollars
we decided not to
that was a very big argument of whether you should let the other people have the dollars
i kept the dollars
they had to come to me if they wanted to make a big change outside their work breakdown structure because i had the problem of trading off the dollars between the propulsion system and the structure system or the aerodynamic system
and you can argue that was the right or wrong thing to do but that was how we did it
and i am not sure if aircraft companies like boeing now or lockheed martin how they do it but they all start off with a work breakdown structure of some type
yes
at that stage do you also give them target weights
you can target weights also yeah
negotiated target weights and negotiated schedules
and they develop the performance
you basically use the target weights from the preliminary designs that you've done to look at the concept that you're looking at to make sure that it is feasible
and when it looks like that is a feasible design then you break up the weights and you give all of the subsystem people their target weights to stay within of which almost immediately the weights start growing
that's right
and when you're a project manager like i was it is career limiting
the first thing is your weight starts to go up
the next thing is you start to have schedule slips because you're finding technology problems
and then the cost starts to go up
you really come with a lot of career limiting problems in project managing but you have to have good people working for you
i think henry another interesting thing you might talk about is they've seen bass redd talk about the aerodynamics they are going to have phil hattis talk about the guidance
navigation and control you might give them your perspective with the hydraulic system of tying those systems together
you mentioned it a little bit but it is probably a little bit harder than you think in putting the requirements on the hydraulic system
i probably spent more personal time dealing with the avionics people the guidance people and the aero people than i did working with the subsystem designs early on just trying to get some reasonableness in the requirements
trying to get the size of the oms engines down trying to get the size of the rcs down trying to get the pulse width a little bit wider
on the hydraulics that was a major major issue because those were really big weight items
on the oms and rcs it was not a big weight impact it was a performance impact of how much propellants you had to carry onboard
but on the hydraulics on the design of that system how fast you had to move one of those flaps on that thing was a big big issue
and i spent lots of time going over and looking at their data looking at what they were coming up with looking at their what ifs
that is what drives a system is what if this happens or what if that happens
another problem i remember we had was the gimbal rate of the main engines
the requirement they put on the gimbal rate
that was a compounded problem too because you were kind of dealing between centers
but yeah the gimbal weight
and the need for a gimbal system on the solid rocket motors if i had my day in court we would take the gimbal system off of the solid rocket boosters
that would save six or seven or eight tons of weight back there
if you would take that system out it would make the solid rocket boosters much more reliable because they've got those great big old boots in there and those big springs
they horse those things back and forth with huge actuators on them
and the only reason we could not eliminate the gimbal system on the srbs is that we had one srb that burned out with the max burn time
and the other one on the other side burned out with minimum burn time
and we lost the top engine on the ssme on the same flight
now you know the probability of that happening is once in a billion
but yet that is what drives the requirement for having the gimbal system
we would have to gimbal the main engines another two degrees to make that work
but that is what drove the design that requirement that we have on the solid rocket motors
so if i can leave you with one message it is understand your requirements extremely well and understand the impact that that requirement is having on your system and on the flyability of the vehicle
i told you that henry had a lot of innovative design
talk a little bit more about the rcs
i thought you were going to mention that before
when they got water and how you solved that problem
this is henry pohl's solution to a very complex problem on the rcs system on the pad
when we got the rcs engines filled up with water we needed to come up with a design to keep the water out of the engines in case of rain because it always rains at the cape
so that requirement fell on the contractor to design a system to keep water from getting into the rcs engines
they came up with a plug with the throat and another big seal to go around those big scarf nozzles out there with an o ring on that
and that was all tied together with cables
and they stuck a big pole upside the vehicle
and just before liftoff they were going to pop that pole over and jerk all of that stuff out
and they were going to jerk it out fast enough so that those big tanks would not fall down and hit the tile and knock all the tile off
well that looked kind of complex and complicated to me
we had a grocery store across the street by the name of wine gardens and i went down and got a roll of that wrapping paper that you use to wrap meats in that has wax on one side and then paper on the other side
i call it butcher paper but butcher paper is actually a little bit different
if you go down and buy something it is freezer paper but i bought a roll of that
then i got back up into the meeting by the time it was over and said this is the way to fix it
and i started tearing off sheets off and passed it around to the managers to look at
we are going to glue that on the surface with the wax side out and glue it on with rtv
and then when you lift it off it would come off
it was light
it wouldn't hurt the tile
if it impacted anything it wasn't going to hurt anything
if it didn't come off when you fired the rcs you would blow it off or burn it off
and that is what we did
and we glued that on all of them
it sounds funny but it is true
you look at the orbiter sitting on the pad and all the rcs jets are covered up with paper
but after i left they changed that
they changed from butcher paper to a special paper developed special for that purpose that is made out of teflon
you have to tell them one more story about the ssme on the launch pad and the hydrogen
this was jr's
when we did the first firing on the pad just a test firing on the launch pad to make sure that everything worked right we blew the back end out of the shuttle
when those main engines light off each one of those engines dump out about one hundred twenty five pounds of hydrogen before it ignites
that hydrogen is cold
it is fairly dense in liquid form
it is four point five pounds per cubic foot or something
by that time it is a little bit lighter
it goes down in the flame pit
it mixes with a lot of air in there
and then the flame hits it and detonates
and it blew the backend out of the vehicle
we needed a quick fix because we're going to launch that thing in three or four days
i looked at the problem and said we will just put roman candles under it
you put a bunch of roman candles under there that fire those balls out across there and the hydrogen comes out
that will ignite the hydrogen
it will burn and won't accumulate behind the pit
and that is what we did
those sparklers you see coming on before the main engines light off those are my roman candles
and as long as we're talking about blowing the back end of the orbiter out maybe you can talk about the pressure wave as well
the pressure wave that came back and the water suppression
we had another problem more of an acoustical problem from the pressure waves coming back up under the orbiter and we needed some kind of a solution to do that
back while i was in huntsville as a test engineer in a test lab there in huntsville we blew the windows out seven miles away when we started firing the saturn five vehicle
we spent a lot of time on sound suppression techniques to reduce the pressure effect
and one of the things we came up with is we found water is very good at damping that
when we had that problem down the cape what we did is put those sausages the hammocks across down there and fill them with water to damp out the pressure wave that came back up to the back of the vehicle
there is another one of them
essentially like big water balloons
we called them sausage
it was a fabric across the bottom filled it up with water and it was strong enough to hold the water up
and then that dampened the sound waves the shockwaves that came back up through the vehicle
again just remember that it is not natural for earth bound humans to think in terms of the absence of gravity and the absence of pressure
i cannot stress that too much
you take a pot of water you put it on the stove and it gets hot on top
you put it on a stove at zero g it does not get hot on top
it pushes all the water out
heat transfer
you don't realize how much heat is transferred out through the atmosphere
if you have no atmosphere you don't get any of that heat transfer out
the other thing to remember is that there is absolutely no substitute for a very well thought out test program
it is not easy to test in the absence of gravity
it is not easy to test in the absence of pressure when you are reducing large quantities of gas or chemicals
but that is very very important
and that is the one thing that really separates a space program from anything that we do here on earth is that you have no atmosphere and you have no gravity to help you in your design
yet all of our thought process is based on having gravity and having an atmosphere
and some of the designs of various experiments that i've worked with on spacelab flights and other flights numerous failures
and over half of the equipment that failed this is stuff generally that we use inside the shuttle it was because of thermal problems that they would overheat just because people didn't get the calculations right
you have no convection
and getting the thermal design to work is just really difficult
convection is one of the major problems that is overlooked because when you put heat in one place on the ground it goes up
if you take the gravity away it will not go up
and that changes the whole complex the thermal matrix
henry talked a little bit about the screen system that was developed for the oms and rcs tanks but just to make sure you appreciate the complexity of this you've probably seen pictures of astronauts playing with food and liquid you blow these big liquid bubbles and they just sort of float there
well the liquid does the same thing inside a fuel tank
and when you push the button because you want to turn your engine to turn on how do you get the fuel to flow into the engine
and as henry said in the old days you had kind of a diaphragm
everything was in like a little balloon and you would pressurize the outside of the balloon and that would force the fuel out but that balloon would get eaten away
i mean remember that was a system that is only used for one flight
now we have a system that has to be reusable
and if you didn't want to replace those diaphragms or balloons every flight you needed something that was a different system
and that is where they came up with the idea of the screens which would have surface tension so enough of the propellant would stick to the screen
and then you would get the helium on the other side that would push it out of the screen
with the oms of course once you got the system started then you're producing an acceleration
and it is always in the same direction so that the oms tanks are designed so that they only have to feed enough propellant through the screening system to get the engine started
and then everything i won't call it gravity fed but is fed by the acceleration
when both engines are burning it is about a tenth of a g
but the rcs that can push you in any direction
and so you have to have a system which will continuously feed no matter which direction your acceleration vector is
it is a really complex and cleaver system
and the design is based strictly on surface tension
why are there so many rcs engines
for example in the nose there are sixteen
is that for redundancy
part of it is for redundancy and part of it is to make sure that you've got one to cover every direction
i guess we've got six going down in front
now we need two of those for certain maneuvers
so you can lose four of them
and we have four going out
you can lose one on either side
and remember you need a couple pair
you would like to be able to do a pure rotation
if you just fire one engine in the aft you're going to get a rotation but you will also get a translation
so you need a couple pairs
and then for redundancy we have three sets
if you add up the x axis the y axis the z axis you've got to be able to translate in three axies you've got to be able to rotate about three axies and then you need dual redundancy for each of that axis
you add it up and you end up with thirty eight primary jets
and then on top of that those are eight hundred fifty pound jets
they use a lot of propellant
when you are in orbit generally and all you worry about is your attitude and you're not doing a propulsive burn for rendezvous or anything we shut down the primary rcs system and we just use six little twenty five pound vernier thrusters all of which are pointed down
when you use those for attitude control they do give you a little bit of propulsive impulse as well
but it is a small enough thrust that it doesn't change your orbit by very much
let me tell you another story about the expulsion devices on the shuttle
back in my young days i grew up in the country and we had a ford tractor
the ford tractor had a screen in the fuel tank and it stood up about that tall
and it had a little stand pipe in there
and the valve was such that when you got down you could set the valve one way and it would leave about a gallon of fuel in the tank
you turn it the other way at the end and it would use that gallon of fuel out kind of like a gas gauge on the early volkswagen
well what happened is that i had that out one day and it had a tenth of an inch diameter hole punched in that screen about halfway up on the screen
i said that screen is not doing any good if it has a hole in it
i got me a ball of solder and i stopped up that screen
you know after that you could have it set where the fuel are supposed to remain in the tank
and when it quit it was empty
you'd switch it over and it still wouldn't run
you couldn't get home
you would have to walk home
well it turned out that they had put that hole in there as a vacuum breaker to break the vacuum on it
and that is the way that the shuttle system works
the screens that we have in there it is fine enough so that the surface tension across those small pores is strong enough so that it will keep the air from punching through unless you put a big hole in them
we had to make sure
and that was another one of the things that convinced me that we could design a screen system that would work in the absence of gravity
it goes back to a ford tractor
it goes all the way back to one thousand nine hundred forty seven and a ford tractor
