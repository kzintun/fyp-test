In the lecture I indicate that the sinusoidal sequenceA cos(w n + #) with w = 3ff/7 and # = - Tr/8 is not periodic. In fact itisperi8dicalthoughRotwithaperiodof2rr/we. (Seeproblem2.1(a)). For w0 = 3/7 the sinusoidal sequence will not be periodic.In this lecture we introduce the class of discrete-time signals andsystems. The unit sample, unit step, exponential and sinusoidal sequences are basic sequences which play an important role in the analysis and representation of more complex sequences. The class of discrete-time systems that we focus on is the class of linear shift-invariant systems. The representation of this class of systems through the convolution sum and some properties of convolution are developed.
