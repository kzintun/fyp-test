This lecture presents several techniques for obtaining a sequence from its z-transform. The primary focus is on informal methods. The first of these, referred to as the inspection method corresponds to utilizing the fact that simple z-transforms and the sequences that generate them are recognizable by inspection. An extension of this method consists of expanding a more complicated z-transform in a partial fraction expansion and then recognizing the sequences that correspond to the individual terms.A somewhat different method for obtaining the inverse z-transform consists of expanding the z-transform as a power series, utilizing either positive or negative values of z, as dictated by the region of convergence and recognizing the coefficients in the series expansion as corresponding to the sequence values.method is that except in simple cases it does not lead to a closed form expression for the sequence. The major advantage with it is that it is more easily applied to z-transform expressions that are non-rational functions of z than are other methods.The final method presented in this lecture is the use of the formal Correction (Fig. d.): The region of convergence of X(l/p) is IpI <2not IpI <1/2.inverse z-transform relationship z-plane. This contour integral expression is derived in the text and is useful, in part, for developing z-transform properties and theorems. The mechanics of evaluating the inverse z-transform rely on the use of residue calculus. An important point stressed in the lecture is the fact that the inverse z-transform integral is valid for both positive and negative values of n. However, for n negative there are multiple order poles introduced at the origin, the evaluation of the residues forwhich is cumbersome. In the lecture a procedure for avoiding this through a substitution of variables is introduced.
