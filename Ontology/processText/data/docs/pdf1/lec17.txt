FIR filters are an important class of digital filters, and in con- trast with continuous-time FIR filters, the implementation of digital filters of this type is relatively straightforward.Design techniques for FIR digital filters are generally carried out directly in the discrete-time domain. This lecture introduces the three primary design techniques, specifically the window method, the frequency sampling method, and the algorithmic design of optimum filters. The window method basically begins with a desired unit- sample response which is then truncated by means of a finite duration window. In the frequency sampling method, the frequency response of the FIR filter is specified in terms of samples of the desired frequency response. The first two design procedures generally do notresult in optimum filter designs. There is available an algorithmic design procedure which generates optimum equiripple FIR filter designs. While I mention this technique only briefly in the lecture, it is developed in considerable detail in the text in sections 7.6 and 7.7
