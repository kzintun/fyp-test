In the previous lecture we developed the notion of the frequency response of LSI systems and discussed the determination of the frequency response from the unit sample response. We begin this lecture by developing an inverse relation by interpreting theexpression for the frequency response as a Fourier series expansion, the coefficients for which are the unit sample response values. We then consider the generalization of the frequency response representation of LSI systems to the Fourier transform representation of sequences. Throughout this set of lectures we will exploit various Fourier transform properties. Many of these properties are derived in a similar manner and it is useful to understand the style in which they are derived rather than simply memorizing the properties. In the lecture the convolution property and some symmetry properties were discussed.A number of other important properties are presented in the text and should be carefully reviewed.The lecture concludes with a discussion of the relationships between continuous-time and discrete-time Fourier transforms. In particular you should be aware from your background in continuous-time linear system theory of the form of the Fourier transform of a sampled time function. Converting a sampled time function to a sequence introduces in essence a "time" normalization since the spacing of sequence values is always interpreted to be unity. Equivalently this time normalization corresponds in the Fourier domain to a frequency normalization.
