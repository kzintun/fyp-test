The class of discrete-time systems characterized by linear constant- coefficient difference equations plays a particularly important role in digital signal processing, in part because many of the issues involved in their implementation are well understood.In this lecture we discuss the representation of this class of systems in terms of signal-flow graphs and matrices. In the two following lectures we will utilize this representation to discuss a number of basic network structures for infinite impulse response and finite impulse response digital filters.This lecture is directed primarily toward introducing the notation of signal-flow graphs and the corresponding matrix representation.Although the concept of computability is discussed briefly in the lecture we will not be relying on this idea in the following lectures. The notion of computability emphasizes, however, the fact that we are viewing the signal-flow graph as representing a computational algorithm for the system, i.e. it represents an implementation of a digital filter. Some flow-graph representations of a digital filter may be mathematically valid but cannot be implemented. This class corresponds to signal-flow graphs which contain delay-free loops.
