In the previous lecture we discussed several basic network structures for IR filters. These structures apply also, of course, to theimplementation of FIR filters.structures which apply specifically to FIR systems, two of which arediscussed in this lecture.The first of these structures applies specifically to linear phase FIR systems. FIR systems can be designed to have exactly linear phase by constraining the unit sample response to be symmetrical.With this symmetry there are only N/2 (for N even) or N+1/2 (for N odd) independent coefficients and such filters can be implemented with astructure requiring only N/2 or N+1/2 multiplications. The second FIR structure discussed in this lecture is referred to as the frequency-sampling structure because the coefficients of this structure are samples of the frequency response of the system.The importance of different structures for digital filters is tied very closely to the considerations involved in a hardware implementation. One such consideration is the effect of finite register length. As an introduction to this issue we discuss briefly in this lecture the relation between structures with regard to parameter quantization effects. The primary result stressed is that the sensitivity of pole and zero locations to parameter quantization tends to be higher for a direct form structure than for a cascade form structure. Even within the cascade structure there is flexibility with regard to how the pole-zero pairs are implemented, resulting in different parameter quantization effects. In particular, coefficient quantization constrains the poles (and zeros) to lie on a grid in the z-plane. The location and density of the grid points is determined by the amount of parameter quantization and the form of the network structure.
