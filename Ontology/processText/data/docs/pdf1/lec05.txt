The Fourier transform does not converge for all sequences. Specifically, depending on the definition of convergence used, the sequence isrequired to be either absolutely summable or have finite energy. It is useful to note that for an LSI system the condition for stability corresponds to the condition for convergence of the Fourier transform of the unit-sample response (i.e. the frequency response). The z-transform represents a generalization of the Fourier transform to include sequences for which the Fourier transform doesn't converge; and can be interpreted as the Fourier transform of the sequence modified by multiplication with a complex exponential.Associated with the z-transform is a region of convergence, i.e. a set of values of z for which the transform converges. As illustrated in the lecture two different sequences can have z-transforms of the same functional form and thus for which the z-transforms are distinguished only by their regions of convergence. This emphasizes the importance of the region of convergence in specifying the z-transform. Based on the properties of the region of convergence it is often possible to indicate implicitly the region of convergence for the z-transform. For example an indication that a sequence is right-sided implies that the region of convergence lies outside the outermost pole in the z-plane. Corresponding statements can be made about left-sided and two-sided sequences. Also, for a "stable" sequence, the region of convergence includes the unit circle in the z-plane. Thus if it is indicated that a z-transform corresponds to a stable sequence then its region of convergence is implied.
