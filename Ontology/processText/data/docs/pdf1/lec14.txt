With this lecture we begin the discussion of digital filter design techniques. The concept of frequency selective filtering for discrete- time signals is identical to that for continuous-time signals and stems from the fact that complex exponentials or sinusoids are eigenfunctions of linear shift-invariant systems. Just as with analog filters, ideal frequency response exactly and must be approximated.Design methods for analog filters have a long history and a variety of elegant design procedures have been developed. Many of the most useful digital filter design techniques are directed at transforming these analog filter designs to digital filter designs, thus taking advantage of rich collection of available filter designs.In this lecture two such transformation procedures are discussed.The first corresponds to approximating the linear constant coefficient differential equation for the analog filter by a linear constant coefficient difference equation by replacing derivative by differences. As we see, this transformation is not a useful one since it does not map the analog frequency response onto the unit circle and does not guarantee that a stable analog filter will yield a stable digital filter.The second transformation discussed is the use of impulse invariance, corresponding to obtaining the discrete-time unit sample response by sampling the analog impulse response. Except for the effect of aliasing the digital frequency response obtained is a scaled replica of the analog frequency response.
