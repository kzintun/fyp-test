In the last lecture we introduced the property of circular convolution for the Discrete Fourier Transform. The fact that multiplication of DFT's corresponds to a circular convolution rather than a linear convolution of the original sequences stems essentially from the implied periodicity in the use of the DFT, i.e. the fact that it essentially corresponds to the Discrete Fourier series of a periodic sequence. In this lecture we focus entirely on the properties of circular convolution and its relation to linear convolution. An interpretation of circular convolution as linear convolution followed by aliasing is developed.As we will see in a later lecture, there is a highly efficient algorithm for the computation of the DFT and consequently it is often useful in practice to implement a convolution (for implementing a filter, for example) by computing the Discrete Fourier Transforms, multiplying, and then inverse transforming. This leads, of course, to a circular convolu­ tion, whereas it is generally a linear convolution that is desired. Consequently an important consideration is the use of circular convolu­ tion to implement a linear convolution. This can be accomplished by extending the lengths of the sequences to be convolved by "padding" with zeros. An additional consideration is the fact that a signal to be filtered may be arbitrarily long. Filtering can still be accomplished in this case using the DFT by first sectioning the input into finite length segments and implementing the convolution for each of these. The filtered segments can then be added with the appropriate synchronization to produce the desired output. There are two basic procedures which are commonly used, referred to as the "overlap-add" and "overlap-save" methods. Although only the first of these is presented in the lecture, both are discussed in the text.
