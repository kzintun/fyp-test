In this lecture the representation of finite length sequences by means of the Discrete Fourier Transform is introduced. This representation corresponds essentially to the Discrete Fourier Series representation of the periodic counterpart of the finite length sequence.The relationship between the DFT and the z-transform is also stressed, deriving in particular the fact that the DFT corresponds to samples of the z-transform equally spaced in angle around the unit circle. also implies, of course, that the Fourier series coefficients of a periodic sequence correspond to samples on the unit circle of the z-transform of one period of the periodic sequence.The lecture concludes with a discussion of properties of the DFT. All of the properties of the DFT are direct consequences of the properties of Fourier series and are generally different than the properties of the Fourier transform as discussed in lecture 4. The shifting property, for example relates to a circular shift of a sequence rather than a linear shift, and it is a circular convolution that results in aproduct of DFT's.
