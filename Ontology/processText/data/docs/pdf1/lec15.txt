In the previous lecture we introduced two techniques for transforming analog filter designs to digital filter designs. The first of these, corresponding to transforming differentials to differences is not a very useful technique for the reasons discussed. The second, that of impulse invariance is a useful technique, although it introduces aliasing which must be accounted for.
In this lecture we begin with an illustration of impulse invariance.An important observation in this example is that the zeros of the analog transfer function don't map to the z-plane in the same way that the poles do. As we stressed in lecture 14, the impulse in­ variant design procedure corresponds to a mapping of the poles and residues rather than a mapping of the poles and zeros. We also ob­ serve in this example the effect of aliasing.The second method for IIR filter design discussed in this lecture is the use of the bilinear transformation. This transformation has the advantage that it maps the entire jQ axis in the s-plane into one revolution around the unit circle in the z-plane. Aliasing is there­ fore eliminated but in contrast to impulse invariance a nonlinear distortion in the frequency axis is introduced. This nonlinear dis­ tortion can be tolerated when the filter to be designed is piece-wise constant but usually cannot be foremore general filter characteristics. In the next lecture a number of these points will be illustratedthrough a design example.Impulse invariance and the bilinear transformation represent the two major analytical techniques for designing digital filters through the transformation of analog designs. There are also a number of al­ gorithmic design procedures for digital filters. We conclude this lecture with a brief introduction to two, one of which requires the solution of a set of nonlinear equations and the second of which leads to a set of linear equations.
