In the past several lectures we considered the Fourier transform and z-transform as tools for the representation and analysis of discrete- time signals and systems. In this lecture we introduce the Fourier series representation for periodic sequences. In the next lecture the Fourier series will be applied to developing a Fourier representation of finite length sequences, referred to as the Discrete Fourier Transform by utilizing the fact that finite length and periodic sequences are closely related. Because of the importance of this relationship in eventually interpreting properties of the Discrete Fourier Transform, this lecture begins with a discussion of the relationship betweeen finite length and periodic sequences. The remainder of the lecture concentrates on the Fourier series representation of periodic sequences.In representing continuous-time signals through the Fourier series, therepresentation in general requires an infinite number of harmonically related complex exponentials (or sines and cosines). In contrast, in the discrete-time case there are only a finite number (N) of distinÂ­ guishable harmonically related complex exponentials with fundamental period N. Thus there are only a finite number (N) of distinguishable Discrete Fourier Series coefficients. In developing the Fourier series representation it is convenient to interpret the Fourier series coefficients as a periodic sequence with period N. This interpretation is consistent with the property that there are only N distinguishable coefficients since the distinguishable values in a periodic sequence are represented by a single period.The lecture concludes with a discussion of some of the properties of Fourier series coefficients. A property which will play an important role in lecture 10 is the convolution property,and in particular the definition of periodic convolution.
