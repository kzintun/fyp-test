This lecture continues the discussion of discrete-time systems. We consider, in particular, the definitions for stability and causality, first for discrete-time systems in general, and then for the particular class of linear shift-invariant systems. We also introduce in this lecture the class of linear shift-invariant systems characterized by linear constant-coefficient difference equations.As the final topic in this lecture we discuss the notion of the frequency response of LSI systems.The description of LSI systems in terms of the frequency response is based on the fact that complex exponentials are eigenfunctions of this class of systems, i.e. the output due to a complex exponential input is of the same form as the input with only a change in the complex amplitude. This implies that for sinusoidal inputs, the output is sinusoidal with the same frequency but with a change in amplitude and phase. Just as with continuous-time systems, the frequency domain representation of discrete-time LSI systems is one of the cornerstones of digital signal processing.
