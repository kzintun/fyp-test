In this lecture two primary ideas are discussed. The first is the determination of frequency response geometrically in the z-plane. This is particularly useful for identifying approximately the effect of pole and zero locations on the frequency response of a system. The second topic discussed in this lecture is that of properties of the z-transform. As with the Fourier transform, properties of the z-trans- form are useful for evaluating the z-transform and inverse z-transform as well as for developing insight into the relationship between sequences and their z-transforms. The more important properties are summarized in section 4.4 and table 4.2 (page 180) of the text. As stressed during the lecture the style in which many of these properties are proven is similar and it is important to develop a facility with this style rather than memorizing the various properties.
