In the previous lecture we introduced the representation of linear digital networks. There are many network structures which can be used to implement a specified transfer function. While all of these structures are mathematically equivalent, they may have different implications for a hardware or software realization of a digital filter.In this lecture we discuss some of the more common structures, specifically the direct-form, cascade form and parallel form.The notion of canonic structures, i.e. structures utilizing the minimum possible number of delays is also considered. Since delay branches in the flow graph represent memory registers in a hardware implementation it is generally desirable to minimize the number of delays in a structure. Implementation of a digital filter inevitably involves trade-offs,however, and the importance of minimizing delays may need to be balanced against other considerations.We also present in this lecture the transposition theorem for signal-flow graphs. This theorem is useful in obtaining new structures. For example we present in this lecture the direct-form II structure and its transpose. Both of these structures are canonic in the number of delays. They differ in the order in which the poles and zeros are implemented,a consideration which is often important when implementing a digital filter with a small register length.
