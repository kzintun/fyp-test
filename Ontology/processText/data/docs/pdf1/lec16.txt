In this lecture we discuss a design example utilizing the two techniques of impulse invariance and the bilinear transformation. We concentrate specifically on the design of a digital filter which is obtained from an analog Butterworth filter. The steps involved are to (1) transform the specifications on the digital filter to the appropriate specifications on the analog filter (2) design the analog filter based on these specifications (3) transform the analog filter to the desired digital filter. The specific example sketched out in the lecture is carried through in more detail in the text.In both the impulse invariant and bilinear design procedures, a para- meter T appears. This parameter is, in fact, unnecessary, as is illustrated in the lecture. Consequently, it is often convenient to choose this parameter to be unity.
